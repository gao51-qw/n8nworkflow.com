  "description": "# Automated AWS IAM Compliance Workflow for MFA Enforcement and Access Key Deactivation\n&gt; This workflow leverages AWS IAM APIs and n8n automation to ensure strict security compliance by continuously monitoring IAM users for MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) enforcement.\n\n[![Watch the video](https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/Red+and+Yellow+Modern+Shocking+Moments+YouTube+Thumbnail+(2).jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZggCRl8z_gQ)\n\n## **Who’s it for**\nThis workflow is designed for **DevOps, Security, or Cloud Engineers** responsible for maintaining IAM security compliance in AWS accounts. It's ideal for teams who want to **enforce MFA usage** and **automatically disable access** for non-compliant IAM users.\n\n## **How it works / What it does**\nThis automated workflow performs a **daily check** to detect IAM users without an MFA device and deactivate their access keys.\n\n### Step-by-step:\n1. **Daily scheduler**: Triggers the workflow once a day.\n2. **Get many users**: Retrieves a list of all IAM users in the account.\n3. **Get IAM User MFA Devices**: Calls AWS API to get MFA device info for each user.\n4. **Filter out IAM users with MFA**: Keeps only users **without any MFA device**.\n5. **Send warning message(s)**: Sends Slack alerts for users who do not have MFA enabled.\n6. **Get User Access Key(s)**: Fetches access keys for each non-MFA user.\n7. **Parse the list of user access key(s)**: Extracts and flattens key information like `AccessKeyId`, `Status`, and `UserName`.\n8. **Filter out inactive keys**: Keeps only **active** access keys for further action.\n9. **Deactivate Access Key(s)**: Calls AWS API to deactivate each active key for non-MFA users.\n\n## **How to set up**\n1. **Configure AWS credentials** in your environment (IAM role or AWS access key with required permissions).\n2. **Connect Slack** via the Slack node for alerting (set channel and credentials).\n3. Set the **scheduler** to your preferred frequency (e.g., daily at 9AM).\n4. Adjust any Slack message template or filtering conditions as needed.\n\n## **Requirements**\n- IAM user or role credentials with the following AWS IAM permissions:\n  - `iam:ListUsers`\n  - `iam:ListMFADevices`\n  - `iam:ListAccessKeys`\n  - `iam:UpdateAccessKey`\n- Slack credentials (Bot token with `chat:write` permission).\n- n8n environment with:\n  - Slack integration\n  - AWS credentials (set via environment or credentials manager)\n\n## **How to customize the workflow**\n- **Alert threshold**: Instead of immediate deactivation, you can delay action (e.g., alert first, wait 24h, then disable).\n- **Change notification channel**: Modify the Slack node to send alerts to a different channel or add email integration.\n- **Whitelist exceptions**: Add a Set or IF node to exclude specific usernames (e.g., service accounts).\n- **Add audit logging**: Use Google Sheets, Airtable, or a database to log which users were flagged or had access disabled.\n- **Extend access checks**: Include console password check (`GetLoginProfile`) if needed.",
