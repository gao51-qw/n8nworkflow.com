  "description": "## Who’s it for\n\nTeams and operators who record meetings/interviews and want fast, standardized, action-oriented minutes—without writing code. New n8n users welcome. \n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nOn form submission, the workflow ingests an audio file and basic metadata, transcribes the audio with OpenAI, summarizes it into concise minutes (key points, next actions with owner & due date, and counterpart concerns/requests), then creates a Google Doc (if missing) and appends the minutes. Sticky notes on the canvas explain each step and required inputs.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect **OpenAI** via Credentials (never hardcode API keys).\n2. Connect **Google (OAuth2)** with Docs/Drive scopes.\n3. Replace any hardcoded Drive folder ID with an env var (e.g., `MINUTES_FOLDER_ID`).\n4. In the Form Trigger, keep the audio upload field and optional metadata (Manager, Partner, Situation).\n5. Test with a short audio sample (30–120 sec), then iterate on the summary prompt.\n   Paste this description into a yellow sticky note at the top of the canvas.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)\n* OpenAI credential with transcription + LLM access\n* Google account with Docs/Drive access and available storage\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n* Tweak the prompt tone, length, or sections (e.g., add “Risks/Blockers”).\n* Change the document title pattern or parent folder.\n* Add Slack or email notifications after the Doc is updated.\n* Log executions to Google Sheets for weekly reporting and audits.\n\n## Security & publishing tips\n\n remove personal IDs (folder IDs, real emails) before sharing; keep node names descriptive; retain sticky notes for setup guidance.\n",
