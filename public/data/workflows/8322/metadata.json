  "description": "## Overview of the n8n Workflow\n\nThis n8n workflow automates sales processes using AI agents integrated with Airtable as a CRM and Gmail for email handling. It consists of two main workflows: one for handling Airtable status changes to send automated emails, and another for processing incoming emails to add new leads to the CRM or respond to existing leads/clients. The agents personalize emails, research leads via web searches, update CRM notes, and include human approval for responses.\n\n---\n\n## Sticky Notes: Setup and Customization Guidance\n\nThe workflows include sticky notes with Markdown formatting for key instructions (assume these are added to the cloned workflows):\n\n1. **Editable Fields (Airtable and Gmail Credentials)**  \n   ```\n   ## Editable Fields\n   - Update Airtable base ID and table ID in trigger/search nodes to match your CRM.\n   - Set Gmail credentials for triggers and email nodes.\n   ```\n\n2. **Editable Fields (API Keys and Models)**  \n   ```\n   ## Editable Fields\n   - Replace Tavily API key in HTTP request nodes with your own (sign up at tavily.com).\n   - Update OpenAI model in chat model nodes if needed (e.g., to gpt-4o).\n   ```\n\n3. **Editable Fields (Google Docs Templates)**  \n   ```\n   ## Editable Fields\n   - Replace Google Docs URLs in document nodes with your own templates for each status/email type.\n   - Ensure Google Docs credentials have read access.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up the Workflow\n\nTo use these workflows in n8n (setup time: ~10-15 minutes):\n\n1. **Import the JSONs**: Paste the provided JSON into n8n to create the two workflows (\"Airtable sales agent\" and \"Email sales Agent\").\n\n2. **Configure Credentials**:  \n   - **Airtable**: Add API token credentials for your base.  \n   - **Gmail**: Set up OAuth2 credentials for your email account.  \n   - **OpenAI**: Add API key for chat models.  \n   - **Google Docs**: Set up OAuth2 credentials with read access to your templates.  \n\n3. **Update Editable Fields**:  \n   - In Airtable nodes: Set your base ID and table ID.  \n   - In HTTP nodes: Replace Tavily API key.  \n   - In Google Docs nodes: Update URLs to your email templates/knowledge base.  \n   - No need to rebuild nodes; all are pre-configured.\n\n4. **Activate Workflows**: Enable the triggers and test with sample data.\n\n---\n\n## Potential Customizations\n\n- **Change Status Templates**: Add more switch outputs and Google Docs nodes for additional Airtable statuses.  \n- **Adjust AI Prompts**: Modify system messages in AI Agent nodes for different personalization or response styles.  \n- **Replace Search API**: Swap Tavily HTTP requests with another search tool if preferred.  \n- **Add More Tools**: Extend the AI Agent with additional tools for CRM updates or integrations.\n\n---\n\n## Considerations and Improvements\n\n- **API Limits**: Monitor Tavily and OpenAI usage to avoid rate limits; add waits if needed.  \n- **Error Handling**: Add IF nodes for cases like no matching lead or failed searches.  \n- **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive lead data in Airtable and emails complies with regulations.  \n- **Testing**: Use test emails and Airtable records to verify before going live.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese n8n workflows create an efficient AI-powered sales system, automating lead addition, CRM updates, and email communications with minimal setup. They integrate seamlessly with Airtable and Gmail, allowing focus on high-value tasks. Customize as needed via the editable fields outlined.\n\n",
