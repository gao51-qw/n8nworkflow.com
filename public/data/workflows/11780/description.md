## How It Works
Aggregates communication data from Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, GitHub, and Confluence into a single, unified AI-powered analysis workflow designed for quality review and automated documentation updates. This solution is specifically aimed at teams managing distributed content and knowledge workflows across multiple platforms. It addresses the challenges of fragmented communication and isolated information silos that often prevent rapid content review and timely decision-making. The workflow begins with a scheduled trigger, followed by multi-source data collection, merging and normalizing inputs, Claude AI-powered analysis, validation and quality checks, formatting, and finally publishing updates to Notion and Confluence, accompanied by Slack notifications to ensure stakeholders are promptly informed.
