This one is for all content creators, marketing teams, and agencies who want to **publish once and post everywhere**.\n\nWith this workflow, you can upload a single video to **YouTube**, **Instagram Reels**, and **TikTok** — simultaneously and automatically.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ What the workflow does\n\n- Downloads a video from a provided URL  \n- Uploads the video to your **YouTube** channel with title and description  \n- Publishes it as a **Reel on Instagram** via the Meta Graph API  \n- Sends the same video to **TikTok** using their official API  \n- Supports credential input via `Set` node (tokens, titles, descriptions)\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Nodes & Tech Used\n\n- `HTTP Request` – Download video and handle uploads to Instagram & TikTok  \n- `YouTube` node – Official n8n integration for video upload  \n- `Set` node – For handling user inputs (tokens, titles, video URLs)  \n- `Switch`, `Wait`, `Merge` – Logic to control publishing status  \n- Manual or webhook start available\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n1. Open the workflow in your **n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)** instance  \n2. Edit the `Set` node called `Credentials` and fill in:\n   - `Token Instagram`  \n   - `Token Tiktok`  \n   - `YouTube title`, `description`, and `video URL`  \n   - Instagram account ID  \n3. Connect your YouTube OAuth credentials in the **YouTube** node  \n4. Optionally, trigger via webhook to automate from other apps (Typebot, CRM, Drive)  \n5. Hit \"Execute Workflow\" or schedule via cron\n\n---\n\n### 👥 Who this is for\n\n- Content creators who want to post everywhere at once  \n- Agencies managing video distribution across platforms  \n- Social media managers and freelancers  \n- Anyone wanting a one-click multi-platform publishing workflow\n\n---\n\n### 🌐 Explore more workflows\n\n❤️ Buy workflows: [https://iloveflows.com](https://iloveflows.com)  \n☁️ Try n8n Cloud: [https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda)",
