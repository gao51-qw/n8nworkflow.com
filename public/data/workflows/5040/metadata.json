  "description": "**This workflow generates deep researched report in markdown format and saves it in Google Sheet, that I then use for generating blogs for my website - [Architjn Blogs](https://architjn.com/blog)**\n\n## How it works\n1. User submits a search topic through a form.\n2. AI generates five deep-dive subtopics for that main topic.\n3. AI creates a research report intro, title, and table of contents based on those topics.\n4. Each subtopic is sent to a search API (Tavily) to collect top 5 sources.\n5. AI writes detailed Markdown content for each subtopic using retrieved sources.\n6. Final content, ToC, intro, and clickable sources are saved to a Google Sheet.\n\n## Set up steps\n- Requires connections to OpenRouter (AI), Tavily (search API), and Google Sheets.\n- Import into n8n and connect credentials for the above services.\n- Configure Google Sheet with proper column headers and grant edit access.\n- Estimated setup time: 20–30 minutes with working API keys.\n- Includes embedded instructions and markdown-style annotations for guidance.",
