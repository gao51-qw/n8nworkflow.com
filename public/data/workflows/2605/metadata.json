  "description": "This workflow leverages **n8n** to perform automated Google Maps API queries and manage data efficiently in Google Sheets. It's designed to extract specific location data based on a given list of ZIP codes and categories.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n- Queries the Google Maps API for location data using predefined ZIP codes and subcategories.\n- Filters, de-duplicates, and organizes data into structured rows in Google Sheets.\n- Implements **exponential backoff retries** to handle API rate limits.\n- Logs and updates statuses directly in Google Sheets for easy tracking.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n1. **Google OAuth Credentials**: A configured Google Cloud project for Google Maps API and Sheets API access.\n2. **Google Sheets**: A sheet with ZIP codes and categories defined (e.g., \"AZ Zips\").\n3. **n8n Setup**: A running instance of n8n with credentials configured for Google OAuth.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Prepare Google Sheets\n- Add the ZIP codes to the \"AZ Zips\" sheet.\n- Define subcategories in another sheet (e.g., \"Google Maps Categories\").\n- Provide the sheet's URL in the `Settings` node of the workflow.\n\n### 2. Configure API Access\n- Set up Google OAuth credentials for Maps and Sheets APIs in n8n.\n- Ensure your API key has access to the `places.searchText` endpoint.\n\n### 3. Workflow Customization\n- Modify `textQuery` parameters in the **GMaps API** node to match your query needs.\n- Adjust trigger intervals as required (e.g., manual or scheduled execution).\n\n### 4. Run the Workflow\n- Execute the workflow manually or schedule periodic runs to keep your data updated.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n- This workflow includes robust error handling to retry failed API calls with exponential backoff.\n- All data is organized and logged directly in Google Sheets for easy reference and updates.\n\nFor more information or issues, feel free to reach out!\n",
