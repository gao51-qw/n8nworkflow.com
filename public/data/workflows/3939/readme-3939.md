# Jira MCP server

> What it does
This n8n workflow creates a powerful AI-powered Jira management system that allows you to use Claude or other AI assistants to create, update, and manage Jira tickets through natural language requests. The workflow exposes key Jira functions as AI tools, enabling you to interact with your Jira instance through conversational commands.
How it works

The workflow sets up an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server, allowing compatible AI assistants to use a suite of Jira management tools
The AI assistant can perform various Jira operations including:

Creating new tickets with customized fields
Adding comments to existing tickets
Retrieving available status transitions for tickets
Attaching files to tickets
Changing ticket statuses
Retrieving detailed information about tickets
Getting available projects and issue types


When you make a request to your AI assistant, it determines which Jira operation to perform and executes it through this workflow

Setup Steps

Prerequisites:

Active Jira Cloud account with admin access
n8n instance with the Langchain and MCP nodes installed
Claude Desktop App or another compatible AI assistant


Jira Credentials Setup:

Configure your Jira Cloud API credentials in n8n 
Ensure your Jira account has sufficient permissions for all operations


Workflow Configuration:

Import this template into your n8n instance
Set up the MCP Trigger node with your desired path (currently "test_mcp")
Verify that all Jira tool nodes are correctly connected to the MCP Server node
Activate the workflow


Using Claude as an MCP Client:

Open your Claude Desktop App
Navigate to Settings &gt; Developer Settings
Enable "Connect to local MCP servers"
Add a new connection with the URL path to your n8n MCP server (e.g., "http://localhost:5678/webhook/test_mcp")
Start a new conversation and ask Claude to perform Jira tasks



Example Usage with Claude
Once you've set up the connection between Claude and your MCP server, you can use natural language to manage your Jira tickets. Here are some examples:

Creating a ticket:
"Claude, please create a new Jira ticket in the Web Development project with bug issue type. The summary should be 'Homepage loading slowly' and the description should be 'Users are experiencing delays of 5+ seconds when loading the homepage on mobile devices.'"
Adding a comment:
"Claude, please add a comment to Jira ticket WEB-123 saying 'This issue has been reproduced on multiple devices and browsers. Priority should be increased.'"
Checking status:
"Claude, can you get the details of ticket WEB-123 and tell me its current status?"
Changing status:
"Claude, please move ticket WEB-123 to 'In Progress' status."

This workflow creates a seamless bridge between your AI assistant and Jira, making project management more efficient through natural language interactions.
