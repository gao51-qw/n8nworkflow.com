  "description": "## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow monitors your Gmail inbox for new, unreplied emails and automatically generates a professional reply draft using AI.  \nInstead of sending the email automatically, the draft is sent to Slack so a human can review and decide whether to send it.\n\nThis makes it ideal for teams that want to save time on email replies while keeping full control over outgoing communication.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Checks Gmail on a schedule for new, unreplied emails  \n2. Limits the number of emails processed per run to avoid overload  \n3. Extracts the email body and sends it to an AI model  \n4. Generates a polite, professional reply draft  \n5. Sends the draft to a Slack channel for review  \n6. Adds a Gmail label to prevent duplicate processing\n\n---\n\n## Setup time\n\n~10–15 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Who this is for\n\n- Customer support teams  \n- Freelancers and consultants  \n- Small businesses handling frequent email inquiries  \n- Anyone who wants AI-assisted email replies with human approval\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Gmail account  \n- Slack workspace  \n- OpenAI (or compatible AI) credentials\n",
