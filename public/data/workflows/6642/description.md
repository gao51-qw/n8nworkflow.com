## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual monitoring for copyright infringement is time-consuming, often reactive rather than proactive, and can miss critical violations that damage brand reputation and revenue. This template solves the challenge of automatically detecting copyright violations, analyzing infringement patterns, and providing immediate legal action recommendations using AI-powered web scraping and automated legal workflows.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically scans the web for potential copyright violations using ScrapeGraphAI, analyzes content similarity, determines legal action requirements, and provides automated alerts for immediate response to protect intellectual property rights.

### Key Components

1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs automatically every 24 hours to monitor for new infringements
2. **ScrapeGraphAI Web Search** - Uses AI to search for potential copyright violations across the web
3. **Content Comparer** - Analyzes potential infringements and calculates similarity scores
4. **Infringement Detector** - Determines legal action required and creates case reports
5. **Legal Action Trigger** - Routes cases based on severity and urgency
6. **Brand Protection Alert** - Sends urgent alerts for high-priority violations
7. **Monitoring Alert** - Tracks medium-risk cases for ongoing monitoring

## 📊 Detection and Analysis Specifications

The template monitors and analyzes the following infringement types:

| Infringement Type | Detection Method | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Exact Text Match** | High similarity score (&gt;80%) | High | Immediate cease & desist |
| **Paraphrased Content** | Moderate similarity (50-80%) | Medium | Monitoring & evidence collection |
| **Unauthorized Brand Usage** | Brand name detection in content | High | Legal consultation |
| **Competitor Usage** | Known competitor domain detection | High | DMCA takedown |
