  "description": "![image.png](fileId:3248)\n\nThis workflow turns any URL (news article, blog post, or even an n8n workflow page) into a vertical short video with your AI avatar explaining it ready for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. It fetches the page, generates a tight 30–45s script and platform-optimized descriptions, captures a dynamic background of the page (animated scroll or static image), composes and renders the video with HeyGen (free split‑screen or paid clean cut‑out), and sends it to Upload-Post with an optional human review step.\n\n***Note: You can generate full videos end‑to‑end using free trials—no credit card required—for all APIs used in this template (Google Gemini, ScreenshotOne, HeyGen, Upload‑Post).***\n\n### Who Is This For?\n- **Creators & Marketers:** Explain articles, launches, and workflows without filming or editing.\n- **Media & Newsletters:** Turn breaking stories into clear, shareable shorts.\n- **Agencies:** Scale content creation with review gates and multi-account publishing.\n- **Founders & Product Teams:** Maintain an on-brand presence in minutes.\n\n### What Problem Does It Solve?\nMaking platform-native explainers is slow and inconsistent. This workflow:\n- **Writes the script with AI:** ~30s hook-led monologue with key facts.\n- **Optimizes per platform:** Tailored captions for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts.\n- **Generates the video automatically:** Uses the page itself as background + avatar voiceover.\n- **Publishes everywhere:** Optional review, then one-click multi-platform posting.\n\n### How It Works\n1. **URL Input:** Paste any page to convert (article, blog, or workflow).\n2. **AI Agent (Gemini):** Reads the page and produces a single script (~30s) + platform-specific descriptions.\n3. **Video Background:** Animated scroll capture (9:16) or featured image via ScreenshotOne.\n4. **HeyGen Composition & Render:**\n   - Free: split-screen vertical (avatar bottom, background top).\n   - Paid: clean avatar cut‑out over video/image (background removal).\n5. **Render & Poll:** Waits for HeyGen to finish and retrieves the final MP4.\n6. **Human Review (optional):** Approve or reject in a simple form.\n7. **Publish (Upload-Post):** Uploads to TikTok, Instagram (Reels), and YouTube Shorts with AI-generated titles/descriptions.\n\n### Setup\n1. **Credentials (all offer free trials, no credit card required):**\n   - HeyGen API (`X-Api-Key`) + your `avatar_id` and `voice_id`.\n   - ScreenshotOne API key.\n   - Upload-Post (connect your social accounts).\n   - Google Gemini (chat model).\n2. **Variables in “Set Input Vars”:**\n   - `workflow_url`: page to convert.\n   - `background_removal`: `true` (paid) or `false` (free).\n   - `background_type`: `video` (animated scroll) or `photo` (static).\n3. **Publishing:** Choose platforms in Upload-Post; enable review if you want to approve before posting.\n\n### Requirements\n- **Accounts:** n8n, HeyGen, ScreenshotOne, Upload-Post, Google (Gemini).\n- **API Keys:** HeyGen, ScreenshotOne, Gemini; Upload-Post credentials.\n- **Assets:** An avatar and a voice available in HeyGen.\n\n### Features\n- **URL → Short in minutes:** 9:16 vertical (720×1280).\n- **Pro script with hook:** Clear, natural, ~30s.\n- **Two render modes:** Split-screen (free) or clean cut‑out (paid).\n- **Background from the page:** Animated scroll or main image.\n- **Human-in-the-loop:** Approval before going live.\n- **Multi-publish:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts via Upload-Post.\n- **Start free:** Generate videos with free trials across all APIs—no credit card required.",
