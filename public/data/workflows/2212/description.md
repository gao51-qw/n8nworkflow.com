Monitor Zalando product pricing and get notified if a Zalando product price falls under a limit you have defined.

This n8n workflow lets you follow the evolution of the price of products you select. For each product, you define a minimal price.

The workflow automatically scrapes the price for you on a daily basis. If the price falls under your minimal price settings, you receive a notification.

This workflow is very easy to use. From a simple form, just paste the URL of the Zalando product you want to monitor and fill in the minimal price.

## Features
- Monitor Zalando Product price: follow the price evolution of your favorite Zalando products.
- Email notification: set a minimal price, if the product price falls below this limit, you get notified by email.
- Visual price evolution: get a graphical overview of the product pricing evolutions.
- Automated Daily check-up: this workflow automatically checks the price of your selected Zalando products on a daily basis.

## Set up
- Copy this workflow to your n8n interface.
- Create a new Google Spreadsheet, [copy this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sM66Rk10ZOhQKbawVB-xZ2WYhBeSr6wnJqvX6Aspbkg/edit?usp=sharing)
- Setup your workflow with your Google credential, your email, and your copy of the Spreadsheet.
- Activate the Workflow and start pasting Zalando product URLs.

I hope you will enjoy this workflow that is probably one of the simplest ways to monitor the pricing evolution of your favorite Zalando products.
