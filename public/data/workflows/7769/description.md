## Overview

This workflow is an AI-powered Booking Assistant that automates restaurant and event reservations through Telegram. It interacts with the user in natural conversation, collects booking details (guest count, preferences, date/time, and special requests), finalizes the draft, and confirms the reservation by storing it in Google Calendar and sending an email confirmation — fully automated end-to-end.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
- The workflow starts with a Telegram welcome message.  
- The AI agent asks step-by-step questions:  
  - Number of guests  
  - Seating preference (indoor/outdoor/private room)  
  - Special occasion requests (birthday, date, etc.)  
  - Preferred date & time  
- Once details are gathered, it generates a draft booking summary.

### 2. Confirmation & Personal Details
- The user reviews the draft and confirms.  
- The assistant then asks for personal details (name, email, phone number).

### 3. Booking & Notifications
- After confirmation, the details are sent to Google Calendar to create an event.  
- A confirmation email is sent to the user with all booking information.  
- A final Telegram message confirms that the reservation is successfully completed.

## How to Use
- Triggered directly from Telegram Bot.  
- Simply start chatting with the bot to begin the reservation process.  
- The assistant will guide the user step by step until the booking is finalized.  
- Once completed, the user receives both an email confirmation and a Telegram confirmation message.
