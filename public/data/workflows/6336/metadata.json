  "description": "## What it Does\nAutomatically checks your Google Calendar to determine if you're officially off work for the rest of today. If so, it auto-sends a personalized out‑of‑office reply via Gmail, telling senders when you’ll be back—based on your next calendar entry within the next 2 weeks.\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo use this template, you'll need:\n- Gmail credentials (for the trigger and reply nodes)\n- Google Calendar credentials (for both calendar checks)\n- A dedicated work calendar selected in the Calendar nodes\n\n## Workflow Logic\n1. Gmail Trigger\n- Monitors incoming emails every minute\n- Can be filtered (e.g., labels or VIP senders)\n\n2. Calendar Check #1\n- Inspects if any events remain today\n\n3. Calendar Check #2\n- If no remaining events, scan the next 14 days for the next event\n\n4. Function Node\n- Formats the return date as Weekday, Month D, YYYY (e.g., “Thursday, July 24, 2025”)\n\n5. Gmail Send\n- Sends a customized out‑of‑office email, using the formatted date\n- Optionally includes n8n attribution (editable)\n\n## User Setup Instructions\n- Gmail Trigger: Connect your Gmail account and add any desired filters (labels, senders).\n- Google Calendar Nodes: Connect your calendar account and select your “work” calendar in both nodes.\n- Function Node: No changes needed unless you prefer a different date format.\n- Gmail Send Node: Edit the message template and toggle attribution as desired.\n\n## Customization - Options\nEdit the final email content and tone in the Send node\n- Adjust calendar lookahead in Calendar Check #2 (default is 14 days)\n- Add Gmail filters to restrict auto-replies (e.g. only specific senders or labels)\n\n## Why It's Useful\nIdeal for freelancers, consultants, or remote workers who don’t follow a strict 9–5, yet want automated responses aligned with their actual availability, not a static setting. It’s dynamic, real-time, and easy to tweak.\n\n## Classification\nUse Case: Calendar-driven out-of-office automation\n\nRecommended audience: Business professionals, freelancers, remote employees",
