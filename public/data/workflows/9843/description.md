📅 100 Daily Prompts Automation

You can scale this workflow to generate one video per day from a batch of 100 prompts in Google Sheets.

Setup Steps

Add 100 prompts to your Google Sheet — one per row.

Set the Status column for each to Pending.

Use a Cron Trigger in n8n to run the workflow once daily (e.g., at 9 AM).

Each run picks one Pending prompt, generates a video, uploads to YouTube, then marks it as Done.

Continues daily until all 100 prompts are processed.

Example Cron Expression
0 9 * * *


→ Runs the automation every day at 9:00 AM.

Node Sequence
[Schedule Trigger (Daily)] → [Get Pending Prompt from Sheets]
→ [Gemini Prompt Parser] → [MagicHour Video Generation]
→ [Optional: MediaFX Audio Mix] → [Gemini Metadata Generator]
→ [YouTube Upload] → [Update Row in Sheets]


💡 Optional Enhancements:

Add a notification node (Slack, Discord, or Email) after each upload.

Add a counter check to stop after 100 videos.

Add a “Paused” column to skip specific rows.
