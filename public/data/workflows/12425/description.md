This workflow is an **AI-powered text-to-speech production pipeline** designed to generate highly expressive audio using **ElevenLabs v3**.
It automates the entire process from raw text input to final audio distribution and upload the mp3 file to Google Drive and an FTP space.

### How it Works

1. **Text Input & Processing**: The workflow accepts text input through multiple triggers - manual execution via "Set text" node, webhook POST requests, or chat message inputs. This text is passed to the Audio Tagger Agent.

2. **AI-Powered Audio Tagging**: The Audio Tagger Agent uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to analyze the input text and intelligently insert ElevenLabs v3 audio tags. The agent follows strict rules: maintaining original meaning, adding tags for pauses, rhythm, emphasis, emotional tones, breathing, laughter, and delivery variations while keeping the output in the original language.

3. **Reference Validation**: During tagging, the agent consults the Context7 MCP tool, which provides access to the official ElevenLabs v3 audio tags guide to ensure correct and consistent tag usage.

4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The tagged text is sent to ElevenLabs' v3 (alpha) model, which converts it into speech using a specific voice with customized voice settings including stability, similarity boost, style, speaker boost, and speed controls.

5. **Dual Output Distribution**: The generated audio file is simultaneously uploaded to two destinations: Google Drive (in a specified "Elevenlabs" folder) and an FTP server (BunnyCDN), ensuring the file is stored in both cloud storage platforms.

### Set Up Steps

1. **Prerequisite Configuration**:
   - Configure Anthropic API credentials for Claude Sonnet access
   - Set up [ElevenLabs API](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu) credentials with access to v3 (alpha) models
   - Configure Google Drive OAuth2 credentials with access to the target folder
   - Set up FTP credentials for BunnyCDN or alternative storage
   - Configure Context7 MCP tool with appropriate authentication headers

2. **Workflow-Specific Setup**:
   - In the "Set text" node, replace "YOUR TEXT" with the default text you want to process (for manual execution)
   - In the "Upload to FTP" node, update the path from "/YOUR_PATH/" to your actual FTP directory structure
   - Verify the Google Drive folder ID points to your intended destination folder
   - Ensure the webhook path is correctly configured for external integrations
   - Adjust voice parameters in the ElevenLabs node if different voice characteristics are desired

3. **Execution Options**:
   - For one-time processing: Use the manual trigger and set text in the "Set text" node
   - For API integration: Use the webhook endpoint to receive text via POST requests
   - For chat-based interaction: Use the chat trigger for conversational text input
