## Overview
An AI-powered, end-to-end interview preparation and mentoring automation system for campus placements. It enables placement cells to generate hyper-personalized 4-page interview preparation PDFs for shortlisted students, by combining job descriptions (JDs), candidate data, and LLMs via LangChain and Ollama.

Note: This template requires self-hosted n8n to run community nodes like LangChain and Ollama.

## What This Workflow Does
Accepts a CSV of shortlisted students and a JD via form upload

Analyzes student profile vs JD using Ollama LLM via LangChain

Generates personalized interview preparation PDFs

Sends the PDF to each student via email

Logs all data in Google Sheets and prevents duplicate processing
