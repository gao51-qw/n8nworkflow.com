## How it works

This template is an interactive playground designed to help you master the most useful keyboard shortcuts in n8n and supercharge your building speed. Forget boring lists—this workflow gives you hands-on tasks to complete, turning learning into a practical exercise.

The workflow is structured into four chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of workflow development:

1.  **Node Basics:** Learn the fundamentals of interacting with a single node, such as renaming, editing, duplicating, and deactivating.
2.  **Canvas Navigation & Selection:** Master the art of moving around the canvas and selecting multiple nodes efficiently.
3.  **Advanced Actions:** Discover powerful moves like tidying up messy connections and creating sub-workflows.
4.  **Execution & Debugging:** Uncover essential shortcuts for testing your workflows, like pinning data and navigating the executions panel.

Each step provides a clear task in a sticky note, guiding you to perform the action yourself.

## Set up steps
