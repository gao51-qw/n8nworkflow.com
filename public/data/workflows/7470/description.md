### How it works
- **User Uploads PDF** : The workflow accepts a PDF via webhook.
- **Extract Text** : n8n extracts the text content from the PDF.
- **Summarize with AI** : The extracted text is passed to an AI model (Groq) with OpenAI model for summarization.
- **Generate Audio** : The summary text is sent to a TTS (Text-to-Speech) API (Qwen-TTS-Demo), you can use other free alternatives.
- **Serve Result** : The workflow outputs both Summary and Audio File URL (WAV link) which you can attached to your audioPlayer.

This allows users to read or listen to the summary instantly.
