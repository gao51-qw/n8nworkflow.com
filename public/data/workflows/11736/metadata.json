  "description": "## 📘 Description\nThis workflow automates document understanding by accepting uploaded PDF or TXT files, extracting their text, generating a structured summary and question–answer set using GPT-4o, validating the AI output, and returning a clean JSON response to the requester. It also sends an internal Slack preview and logs malformed outputs for debugging.\nIt performs intelligent file-type detection, handles binary text extraction, enforces strict JSON formatting from the AI model, and ensures that the final response is clean, structured, and ready for use in downstream systems. All errors—missing text, invalid JSON, or malformed AI output—are captured automatically in Google Sheets.\nThe workflow is designed as a plug-and-play document-analysis engine that converts any uploaded document into meaningful insights instantly.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n📥 Receive Document Upload via Webhook\n Captures incoming files (PDF or TXT) posted to the webhook endpoint.\n\n🔍 Check If Uploaded File Is PDF / TXT\n Detects file extension and routes it correctly for extraction:\nPDF → PDF extractor\nTXT → text extractor\n Other file types are ignored.\n\n📝 Extract Text from Document\nExtracts readable text from PDF binaries\nReads raw plain text from TXT files\nThe extracted text becomes input for the AI analysis.\n\n🤖 Generate Summary & Q&A Using AI\n Uses GPT-4o to produce:\nA 150–200 word summary\nFive structured Q&A pairs\n Output must strictly follow the specified JSON schema.\n\n🧠 LLM Engine + Memory Context\nGPT-4o provides the reasoning engine\nMemory buffer maintains short context for stability\nOutput parser ensures schema compliance\n\n⚠️ Validate AI Output Before Processing\n Checks whether output is non-empty and correctly structured.\n Invalid → logged to Google Sheets.\n\n📊 Log Invalid AI Output to Google Sheet\n Records failures for audit, debugging, and retraining.\n\n🧹 Unwrap AI Output Object\n Removes unnecessary array wrappers and normalizes the result.\n\n📤 Prepare Final Response Payload\n Ensures the workflow responds with a single clean JSON object.\n\n🔁 Send Final Summary & Q&A Response to Webhook\n Returns the final structured JSON to the requesting system.\n\n💬 Send Summary Preview to Slack\n Shares a short preview (first 300 characters) for internal visibility.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\nWebhook endpoint configured for uploads\nAzure OpenAI GPT-4o credentials\nGoogle Sheets OAuth connection\nSlack bot token\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Fully automated PDF/TXT understanding\n ✔ AI-powered summary + structured Q&A\n ✔ Strict JSON compliance for downstream systems\n ✔ Error-proof: logs all failures for investigation\n ✔ Slack visibility for quick internal review\n ✔ Works with minimal human involvement\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n-  Research teams\n-  Documentation workflows\n-  Customer-support intelligence\n-  Interview screening document parsing\n-  Internal knowledge extraction systems",
