## What this workflow does
This workflow automates **end-to-end stock analysis** using real market data and AI:

- Reads a list of stock tickers from **Google Sheets**
![image.png](fileId:3859)

- Fetches **fundamental data** (valuation, growth, profitability) and **OHLCV price data** from **EODHD APIs**
- Computes key **technical indicators** (RSI, SMA 20/50/200, volatility, support & resistance)
- Uses an **AI model** to generate:
  - Buy / Watch / Sell recommendation
  - Entry price, stop-loss, and take-profit levels
  - Investment thesis, pros & cons
  - Fundamental quality score (1–10)
- Stores the final structured analysis back into **Google Sheets**

This creates a **repeatable, no-code stock analysis pipeline** ready for decision-making or dashboards.
