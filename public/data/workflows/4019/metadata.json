  "description": "# Daily YouTrack In-Progress Tasks Summary to Discord by Assignee\n\nKeep your team in sync with a daily summary of tasks currently **In Progress** in YouTrack — automatically posted to your **Discord** channel.\n\nThis workflow queries issues, filters them by status, groups them by **assignee** and **priority**, and sends a formatted message to Discord. It's perfect for teams that need a lightweight, automated stand-up report.\n\n&gt; 📝 This workflow uses **Discord** as an example. You can easily replace the messaging integration with Slack, Mattermost, MS Teams, or any other platform that supports incoming webhooks.\n\n## Use Case\n\n- Remote development teams using YouTrack + Discord\n- Replacing daily stand-up meetings with async updates\n- Project managers needing quick visibility into active tasks\n\n## Features\n\n- **Scheduled** daily execution (default: weekdays at 09:00)\n- **Status filter**: only issues marked as `In Progress`\n- **Grouping** by assignee and priority\n- **Custom mapping** for user mentions (YouTrack → Discord)\n- **Clean Markdown output** for Discord, with direct task links\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### YouTrack Configuration\n\n1. **Get a permanent token**:\n   - Go to your YouTrack profile → Account Security → Authentication\n   - Create a new permanent token with \"Read Issue\" permissions\n   - Copy the token value\n\n2. **Set the base API URL**:\n   - Format: `https://yourdomain.youtrack.cloud/api/issues`\n   - Replace `yourdomain` with your actual YouTrack instance\n\n3. **Identify custom field IDs**:\n   - Method 1: Go to YouTrack → Administration → Custom Fields → find your \"Status\" field and note its ID\n   - Method 2: Use API call `GET /api/admin/customFieldSettings/customFields` to list all field IDs\n   - Method 3: Inspect a task's API response and look for field IDs in the `customFields` array\n   - Example Status field ID: `105-0` or `142-1`\n\n### Discord Configuration\n\n- Create a **webhook URL** in your Discord server:\n  - Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook\n  - Choose target channel and copy the webhook URL\n  - Extract webhook ID from URL (numbers after `/webhooks/`)\n\n## Environment Variables & Placeholders\n\n| Placeholder | Description |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| `{{API_URL}}` | Your YouTrack API base URL |\n| `{{TOKEN}}` | YouTrack permanent token |\n| `{{FIELD_ID}}` | ID of the \"Status\" custom field |\n| `{{QUERY_FIELDS}}` | Fields to fetch (e.g., summary, id) |\n| `{{PROJECT_LINK}}` | Link to your YouTrack project |\n| `{{USER_X}}` | YouTrack usernames |\n| `{{DISCORD_ID_X}}` | Discord mentions or usernames |\n| `{{NAME_X}}` | Display names |\n| `{{WEBHOOK_ID}}` | Discord webhook ID |\n| `{{DISCORD_CHANNEL}}` | Discord channel name |\n| `{{CREDENTIAL_ID}}` | Your credential ID in n8n |\n\n## Testing the Workflow\n\n1. **Test YouTrack connection**:\n   - Execute the \"HTTP Request YT\" node individually\n   - Verify that issues are returned from your YouTrack instance\n   - Check if the Status field ID is correctly filtering tasks\n\n2. **Verify filtering**:\n   - Run the \"Filter fields\" node\n   - Confirm only \"In Progress\" tasks pass through\n\n3. **Check message formatting**:\n   - Execute the \"Discord message\" node\n   - Review the generated message content and formatting\n\n4. **Test Discord delivery**:\n   - Run the complete workflow manually\n   - Verify the message appears in your Discord channel\n\n5. **Schedule verification**:\n   - Enable the workflow\n   - Test weekend skip functionality by temporarily changing dates\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n- **Language**: All labels/messages are in English — customize if needed\n- **User mapping**: Adjust assignee → Discord mention logic in the message builder\n- **Priorities**: Update the `priorityMap` to reflect your own naming structure\n- **Schedule**: Modify the trigger time in the `Schedule Trigger` node\n- **Alternative platforms**: Swap out the Discord webhook for another messaging service if preferred",
