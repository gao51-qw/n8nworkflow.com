## Who is this for?
This workflow is ideal for businesses, accountants, and finance teams who receive bank slip images via LINE and want to automate the extraction of transaction details. It eliminates manual data entry and speeds up financial tracking.

What problem does this workflow solve?
Many businesses receive bank transfer slips via LINE from customers, but manually recording transaction details into spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone. This workflow automates the entire process, extracting structured data from the bank slips and storing it in Google Sheets for seamless record-keeping.

## What this workflow does:
- Receives bank slip images from LINE BOT
- Extracts transaction details (sender, receiver, amount, transaction ID) using SpaceOCR
- Automatically logs extracted data into Google Sheets
- Works with Standard Bank Slips & PromptPay transactions
- Eliminates manual data entry and reduces errors


## Setup Instructions:
### 1. Prerequisites
- A **LINE BOT** with Messaging API enabled
- A **SpaceOCR API Key** (Get from https://spaceocr.com/)
- A **Google Sheets account** to store extracted data
- An **n8n instance** running (Cloud or Self-hosted)

### 2. Setup Google Sheets
Create a Google Sheet with the following structure:

A (Date)	B (Time)	C (Sender)	D (Receiver)	E (Bank Name)	F (Amount)	G (Transaction ID)

- Ensure your Google Sheets API is enabled and connected to n8n.

For an example of the required format, check this Google Sheets template: [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpvzcnWmb-aLpSleTIF0xoF8xzbOOJQhuT6ITAeEQks/edit?usp=sharing)
