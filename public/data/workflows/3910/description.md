## What this workflow does

This n8n workflow collects client feedback through a form (Tally, Typeform, or Google Forms) and uses AI to analyze it.  
It automatically generates a summary of the positive points, highlights areas for improvement, and drafts a short social media post based on the feedback.

Ideal for:
- Freelancers
- Customer support teams
- Online service providers
- Coaches and educators

## Setup steps

2. Add your DeepSeek (or other GPT-compatible) API key to the AI request node.
3. Configure the email node with your SMTP credentials and desired recipient address.
4. Replace the Telegram node with Slack, Buffer, or another integration if you prefer.
5. *(Optional)* Customize the prompt in the function node for different tone/language.

🕐 **Estimated setup time**: ~15 minutes
