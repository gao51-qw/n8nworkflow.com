  "description": "# AI Video Generator for eCommerce Product Catalogs\n\nTransform static product images from any online store into engaging animated videos using Google's Veo 3.1 AI. Simply submit a catalog page URL and automatically generate professional product showcase videos where models pose and move to display clothing and fashion items from multiple angles - perfect for elevating product pages with dynamic content that increases conversion rates.\n\n## How it works\n\n* **Submit any eCommerce catalog page URL** through a simple web form (works with Shopify, WooCommerce, and most online stores)\n* **Automatically scrapes product listings** using Firecrawl to extract product titles and high-quality images\n* **Batch processes product images** with intelligent iteration through your catalog inventory\n* **Generates 8-second animated videos** using Google Veo 3.1 where models wearing the clothing strike multiple poses to showcase fit and style\n* **Polls for completion status** and automatically downloads finished videos when ready\n* **Organizes assets in Google Drive** with source images and output videos in a structured folder system\n\nThe workflow creates professional product videos that show garments from different angles with natural model movements, giving shoppers a much better sense of how items look and fit compared to static photos alone.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. **Connect API credentials**: Firecrawl account for web scraping, Google Gemini/Veo API for video generation, Google Drive for asset storage\n2. **Create Google Drive output folder** where source images and generated videos will be automatically saved\n3. **Configure folder ID** in the workflow to point to your designated Drive location\n4. **Adjust product limit** (optional) to control how many catalog items to process per run\n5. **Deploy the form webhook** to get your submission URL for catalog page processing\n\n**Time investment**: ~15-20 minutes for API setup and configuration, then just submit catalog URLs to automatically generate video content for your entire product line.\n\n**Requirements**: Firecrawl account for web scraping, Google Cloud account with Veo 3.1 API access (currently in preview), Google Drive account. Works best with fashion and apparel catalogs.\n\n**Note**: Video generation takes approximately 10 seconds per product as Veo processes each request. The workflow includes automatic polling to handle the async video generation process.",
