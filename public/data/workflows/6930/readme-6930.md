## 🚀 Problem Statement
Monitoring hundreds of IoT devices across multiple dashboards is overwhelming and reactive, often leading to costly downtime, missed maintenance windows, and system failures. This template solves the challenge of proactive IoT device monitoring by automatically analyzing device health metrics, detecting issues before they become critical, and delivering intelligent alerts that help teams maintain optimal system performance.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically monitors your IoT dashboard every 30 minutes using AI-powered data extraction, analyzes device health patterns, calculates system-wide health scores, and sends intelligent alerts only when intervention is needed, preventing alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues are never missed.

### Key Components

1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs every 30 minutes for continuous device monitoring
2. **AI Dashboard Scraper** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract device data from any IoT dashboard without APIs
3. **Health Analyzer** - Calculates system health scores and identifies problematic devices
4. **Smart Alert System** - Sends notifications only when health drops below thresholds
5. **Telegram Notifications** - Delivers formatted alerts with device details and recommendations
6. **Activity Logger** - Maintains historical records for trend analysis and reporting

## 📊 Device Health Analysis Specifications

The template monitors and analyzes the following device metrics:

| Metric Category | Monitored Parameters | Analysis Method | Alert Triggers | Example Output |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Device Status** | Online/Offline/Error | Real-time status check | Any offline devices | "Device-A01 is offline" |
| **Battery Health** | Battery percentage | Low battery detection | Below 20% charge | "Sensor-B03 low battery: 15%" |
| **Temperature** | Device temperature | Overheating detection | Above 70°C | "Gateway-C02 overheating: 75°C" |
| **System Health** | Overall health score | Online device ratio | Below 80% health | "System health: 65%" |
| **Connectivity** | Network status | Connection monitoring | Loss of communication | "3 devices offline" |
| **Performance** | Response metrics | Trend analysis | Degraded performance | "Response time increasing" |
