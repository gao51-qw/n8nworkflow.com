## Automated Financial Reporting Using Google Vision OCR, Telegram & Google Sheets


This workflow automates the process of recording financial transactions from photos of receipts or shopping receipts. Users simply send an image of the receipt via Telegram. The image is processed using the Google Vision API to detect text, then extracted and structured by LLM via OpenRouter. The final result is saved to Google Sheets and also displayed to the user via a Telegram bot.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- The image is converted to text using the Google Vision API's OCR.
- Data processing with LLM (OpenRouter) helps identify and structure transaction elements such as: date, vendor name & address, receipt/invoice number, item list (product name, quantity, unit price, total), and transaction category.
- Cleaned and structured data is automatically recorded to Google Sheets per item.
- The system also sends a summary of the recording results in an easy to read text format.
- Users can also send text messages to the bot to query stored transaction data, which will be answered by a Google Sheets-based AI Agent.
