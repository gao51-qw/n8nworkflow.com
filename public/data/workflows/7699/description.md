# Send daily applicant digest by role from Gmail to hiring managers with Google Gemini

This workflow automatically collects all new job application emails from your Gmail labeled as **applicants** in the last 24 hours. Every day at 6:00 PM (Asia/Kolkata), it extracts structured details (name, email, phone, role, experience, skills, location, notice, summary) from each applicant (using Gemini AI or OpenAI). It then groups applicants by role and manager, compiles a neat HTML table digest for each manager and emails them a single summary — so hiring managers get everything they need, at a glance, in one place.

## Who’s It For

- Recruiters and hiring managers tired of digging through multiple application threads.
- Small HR teams / agencies not yet on a full applicant tracking system.
- Anyone wanting a consolidated, role-targeted applicant update each day.
- Teams that want to automate candidate triage using Google Workspace and AI.

## How It Works

1. **Schedule Trigger (6PM IST):** Runs automatically at 18:00 India time.
2. **Fetch Applicant Emails:** Reads Gmail for emails labeled 'applicants' from the past 24 hours.
3. **Prepare Email Text:** Converts email content to plain text for reliable AI extraction.
4. **Extract Applicant Details:** Gemini/OpenAI extracts applicant’s info in structured JSON.
5. **Assign Manager Emails:** Routes each applicant to the correct manager via role→email mapping or fallback.
6. **Group & Build HTML Tables:** Organizes applicants by manager and role, builds summary tables.
7. **Send Digest to Managers:** Sends each manager one HTML summary email for their new applicants.

## How to Set Up

1. **Create/verify Gmail label** `applicants` and set up filters to route job emails there.
2. **Import the workflow:** Use your Google/Gmail and Gemini/OpenAI accounts as credentials.
3. **Configure connections:**
	- Gmail with OAuth2 (IMAP not required, uses Gmail API)
	- Gemini or OpenAI API key for extraction
4. **Set role→manager** mapping in the “Assign Manager Emails” node (just edit the map!).
5. **Adjust time / defaults:** Edit schedule and fallback email if you wish.
6. **Test it:** Send yourself a test application, label it, check workflow logs.

## Requirements	

- Gmail account (with OAuth2 enabled and 'applicants' label set up)
- Gemini or OpenAI API key for structured AI extraction
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- SMTP credentials (if using direct email instead of Gmail node)
- At least one valid hiring manager email mapped to a role

## How to Customize the Workflow

- Centralize config with a **Set node** (label name, fallback/manager email, model name, schedule).
- Add attachment-to-text conversion for applications with resume attachments.
- Normalize role names in the mapping code for more robust routing.
- Enable additional delivery: Slack, Teams, Google Sheets log, extra Cron for mid-day urgents.
- Refine AI extraction prompt for specific fields (add portfolio URL, etc.).
- Change schedule for daily, weekly or per-role timing.

## Add‑Ons / Extensions

- **Resume Text Extraction:** Add PDF/DOCX to text parsing for attachment-only applications.
- **ChatOps:** Send the summary to Slack or Teams channels along with/instead of email.
- **Applicant Logging:** Auto-log every applicant/action into Google Sheets, Notion or Airtable.
- **Multi-timezone:** Duplicate/modify the Cron trigger for different manager regions or urgency levels.

## Use Case Examples

- **Tech Hiring:** Java, Python, Frontend candidates are automatically routed to their respective leads.
- **Small Agency:** All applications summarized for reviewers, with per-role breakdowns.
- **HR Operations:** Daily rollups sent before hiring sync, facilitating fast decision-making.

## Common Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| No emails processed | No 'applicants' label or wrong time window | Check Gmail filters and adjust search query in fetch node |
| All digests go to fallback manager | Incorrect or missing role → manager mapping | Normalize role text in assignment node, expand map |
| AI Extraction returns bad/missing JSON | Wrong prompt, high temperature or missing field names | Tighten prompt, lower temperature, check example response |
| Duplicate/Old Emails appear | Date filter not correct | Use 'newer_than:1d' and keep 'mark as read' in email node |
| SMTP/Gmail Send errors | Auth problem, quota or app password missing | Use OAuth2, check daily send caps and app password settings |
| Blank or partially filled summary table | AI unable to parse poorly formatted/empty email | Improve sender email consistency, add fallback handling |
| Attachments not processed | No attachment extraction node | Add attachment-to-text parsing before AI node |
