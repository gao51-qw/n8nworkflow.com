## ⚡️ How It Works

This workflow captures form submissions from your website, formats the data, and automatically creates a new entry in your Notion CRM database. It eliminates manual copy-pasting and keeps your leads or requests organised in one place.

	•	You can customise the fields in the code to suit your specific form inputs.
	3.	Notion Node (Create Page)
	•	Connect your Notion account.
	•	Choose your target database.
	•	Map each field from the Code node output to your Notion database properties.
	4.	Test
	•	Submit a test form entry.
