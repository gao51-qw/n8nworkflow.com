## Shopify GraphQL cursor loop

Many Shopify GraphQL queries have the ability to return a cursor which you can loop over, however the N8N GraphQL node does not natively have the ability to fetch pages.  

This simple 3 node workflow displays how to setup a cursor to fetch all items in a collection. 

Note : The pageSize in the "Shopify, products" node is set to 5 to illustrate how querying by cursor works. In production set this to a much larger value.
