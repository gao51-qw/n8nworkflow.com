  "description": "# 🔧 AI-Powered Cold Call Machine\n\n## 🎯 Purpose\nThe **AI-Powered Cold Call Machine** is a fully automated workflow designed to generate **qualified leads from LinkedIn**, evaluate them using **AI-based scoring**, identify key decision-makers, and generate **personalized cold call scripts**. All results are saved to a Google Sheet-based CRM.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n### 1. **Initialization**\n- Triggered either **manually** or via **schedule**.\n- Pulls configuration from a Google Sheet’s **Settings** tab (e.g., target product, keywords, company size, API key).\n\n### 2. **Company Search on LinkedIn**\n- Uses the **Ghost Genius API** to search for companies based on cleaned, relevant keywords extracted by **OpenAI**.\n- Handles pagination, up to **1000 companies per batch**.\n\n### 3. **Company Filtering**\nEach company goes through:\n- Data enrichment via Ghost Genius (website, size, followers, etc.).\n- Filtering:\n  - Must have a **LinkedIn page with a website**.\n  - Must have **200+ followers**.\n- Deduplication: checks if the company already exists in the CRM.\n\n### 4. **AI-Based Company Scoring**\n- A specialized **AI model scores each company** from 0 to 10 based on:\n  - Industry fit.\n  - Size/location alignment.\n  - Potential pain points that match your offering.\n- If the company is **new and relevant (score ≥ 7)**, it is saved in the **Companies** sheet.\n\n### 5. **Decision Maker Identification**\n- Uses **Sales Navigator API** (via Ghost Genius) to find employees with targeted job titles.\n- For each matching profile:\n  - Enriches contact data (title, bio, etc.).\n  - Retrieves phone number (if available).\n  - Generates a **20-second personalized cold call script** using OpenAI, based on company and profile data.\n  - Saves all information in the **Leads** tab of the CRM.\n\n- If no decision maker is found, the company status is marked accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Outcome\n- A fully enriched, **qualified lead database**.\n- **Custom cold call scripts** ready to be used by SDRs or founders.\n- Zero manual work – from search to lead generation, everything is **automated**.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Use Case\nPerfect for SDRs, founders, or growth marketers looking to **scale cold outreach** without sacrificing personalization or running into LinkedIn scraping limits.\n\n---\n\n",
