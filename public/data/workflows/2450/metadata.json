  "description": "This automation syncs your Invoice PDFs from Stripe to a (AWS) S3 Bucket each month, in a folder of your choice, with the following subPath:\n\n*yourFolder/invoiceYear/invoiceMonth/fileName*\n\n\nFill in your **Credentials and Settings** in the Nodes marked with _\"*\"_.\n\nYou can adjust this Workflow to your needs. You can also override the `year`and `month` in the ENV* Node for manual syncs. It will sync every Invoice PDF which `created`-date is *greater then* the provided year and month. It will automatically set the day to the first day of the desired month.\n\n\n![Image](https://cloud.let-the-work-flow.com/logo-64.png)\nEnjoy the Workflow! ❤️ \nhttps://let-the-work-flow.com\nWorkflow Automation & Development",
