Create a unique **variant** for each available size, including a custom SKU.\n    2.  Upload all associated **product images** from their external URLs to the product.\n* A final **Slack** notification confirms the batch has been processed.\n\n---\n### Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping\n* **BrowserAct** \"**Bulk Product Scraping From (URLs) and uploading to Shopify (Optimized for shoe - NIKE -&gt; Shopify)**\" Template\n* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))\n* **Google Sheets** credentials for the input list\n* **Shopify** credentials (API Access Token) to create and update products, variants, and images\n* **Slack** credentials (optional) for notifications\n\n---\n\n### Need Help?\n* #### [How to Find Your BrowseAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDjoZWEsZlE)\n* #### [How to Connect n8n to Browseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* #### [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n* #### [How to Use the BrowserAct N8N Community Node](https://youtu.be/j0Nlba2pRLU)\n\n---\n### Workflow Guidance and Showcase\n\n* #### [Automate Shoe Scraping to Shopify Using n8n, BrowserAct & Google Sheets](https://youtu.be/HPPJNlcMB3I)",
