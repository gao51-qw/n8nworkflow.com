  "description": "## What it does\nThis workflow automates content syndication and posting to **LinkedIn** and **X/Twitter**. It takes existing long-form articles and generates from them engaging social posts optimized for each platform.\n\nThe workflow takes links to existing articles from a given sitemap. It randomly selects the next article to republish, making sure that articles are not repeated. For simplicity it uses a Google spreadsheet to track the articles that have already been republished.\n\n## Requirements\n1. Existing [sitemap](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)\n2. Google Gemini API key (or other model provider's key)\n3. Google Sheets credentials\n4. LinkedIn credentials\n5. X/Twitter credentials\n\n## How to set up\n1. Adjust the schedule as needed (by default triggers daily at noon)\n2. Configure parameters in the **parameters** node:\n    - Set the sitemap URL (e.g. https://example.com/sitemap.xml)\n    - Set the language of the posts\n    - Enable/disable channels as needed\n3. Configure Google Sheets credentials for **get processed articles** and **add processed articles** nodes\n3. Create a new Google spreadsheet document with \"url\", \"status\", \"timestamp\", \"LinkedIn post\" and \"Twitter post\" columns\n4. Specify that spreadsheet document in **get processed articles** node (other nodes will take it from here)\n5. Add Google Gemini API key for the model (or change to any other model of choice)\n6. Configure LinkedIn and X/Twitter credentials for publishing\n",
