  "description": "## Purpose\n\nThis workflow allows granular control over the access to tools connected to AI Agents (including Multi-Agent setups) using **R**ole **B**ased **A**ccess **C**ontrol.\n\n## Demo & Explanation\n\n[![demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eNgik9NR0wg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/eNgik9NR0wg)\n\n## How it works\n\n- User permissions are managed in Airtable where every restricted AI tool is listed by name and connected via roles to users\n- Requests to the Main Agent can be sent through a Telegram message (can be replaced by Whatsapp, IMAP or similar)\n- On every request the Telegram username is used to query a list of all allowed tools which are linked in Airtable\n- A LangChain Code node is used to compare that list against the connected tools\n- Every tool which is not permitted to be used is being replaced by a tool, which has a status response, telling the Agent to return a message to the user, that he is not authorized to use the tool\n- Otherwise allowed tools are passed through to the Agent, as if they were connected directly to the Agent\n- The parameters can also be passed to a sub-agent called as a sub-workflow where permissions can be checked the same way\n- Every response is sent back to the same Telegram conversation\n\n## Setup\n\n- Clone the workflow and select the belonging credentials. You'll need an OpenAI and Airtable Account as well as a Telegram Bot (refer to the docs for the [Telegram credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/telegram/)).\n- Copy [this Airtable Template](https://airtable.com/appi5nijuvzQbZLJJ/shr8OkLysG1VtlCiz) into your workspace\n- Follow the instructions given in the yellow sticky notes\n- Activate the workflow\n\n## How to use\n\nTry this example:\n\n- Create a new line in Airtable under “Users” containing your Telegram username and your full name\n- Set the roles “basic” and “info”\n- *Consider temporarily disconnecting or resetting the chat memories so they do not remember previous confirmations*\n- Start a new chat, asking about your permitted roles - you should get a list of those\n- Ask about the current weather in your city - you should be informed, that you do not have permission to access that information\n- Back in Airtable add the role “weather” to your user\n- Now ask the Agent the same question again - It should give you a proper answer this time\n\nFrom here on you can add tools and create roles to your likings.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the LangChain Code Node.",
