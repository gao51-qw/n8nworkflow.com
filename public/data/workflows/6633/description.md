This automated n8n workflow processes any inquiry emails using AI-powered intelligence to determine customer intent and provide appropriate responses. The system analyzes incoming emails, performs availability checks or direct booking processing, and sends personalized responses based on the customer's specific requirements across any industry vertical.

## **Good to Know**

* Uses Google Gemini Chat Model for intelligent email analysis and response generation
* Automatically detects customer intent (availability check vs direct booking request)
* Includes conditional routing for different response types based on AI analysis
* Integrates with external booking systems through HTTP requests
* Provides seamless email automation with personalized customer communication

## **How It Works**

1.  **Gmail Trigger**: Initiates the workflow upon receiving a new email.
2.  **AI Agent**: Analyzes the email content to determine the customer's intent (availability check or direct booking).
3.  **Code**: Parses the JSON output from the AI Agent.
4. **Wait for Data** - Ensures proper data synchronization before proceeding with conditional logic
5.  **If**: Routes the workflow based on the detected intent.
6.  **Gmail Nodes**: Sends appropriate responses or forwards booking details.
