# Automate contact enrichment with Surfe, Google Sheets & HubSpot

> This template enables fully automated lead enrichment using Surfe’s bulk API. Simply drop a Google Spreadsheet into your Google Drive, and n8n will handle everything — from reading the leads, enriching them in batches, filtering valid data, and pushing results to HubSpot.

## 1. ❓ What Problem Does This Solve?

Manually enriching contact lists is tedious, error-prone, and doesn’t scale. Whether you’re importing leads from events, marketing forms, or partners, this workflow ensures each record is enriched and synced to your CRM — hands-free.

---

## 2. 🧰 Prerequisites

To use this template, you’ll need:

- A self-hosted or cloud instance of [n8n](https://n8n.io/)
- A **Surfe API Key**
- A **Google Drive and Sheets** account (with OAuth or service account)
- A **HubSpot account** with access to create/update contacts (via OAuth or Private App Token)
- The workflow JSON file (included with this tutorial)

## 3. 📌 Input File Format

To run the automation, you must upload a Google Spreadsheet to a specific folder in your Drive.

The spreadsheet must contain the following columns:

- `first name` (required)
- `last name` (required)
- Either `company name` or `company domain` (at least one is required)
- `linkedin url` (optional)

🛑 Important: Any row missing first name, last name, and both company name and company domain will be ignored automatically by the workflow.

Each row represents a person to enrich.
We recommend including the `linkedin url` if available, but it's not mandatory.

## 5. 🔄 How This N8N Workflow Works

1. A new **Google Sheet** containing a `linkedin_url` column is added to a specific folder in Google Drive
2. n8n detects the new file automatically via the Google Drive Trigger
3. All rows are read and **batched in groups of 500** to comply with Surfe’s API limits
4. Each batch is sent to Surfe’s **Bulk Enrichment API**
5. n8n **polls Surfe** until the enrichment job is complete
6. It extracts the enriched contact data from Surfe’s response
7. Only contacts with **both email and phone number** are kept
8. These validated leads are **pushed to HubSpot**
9. Finally, a **Gmail notification** is sent to confirm the job is complete

---

## 6. 🧩 Use Cases

- **Post-event contact enrichment** – After a trade show, upload a list of LinkedIn profile URLs from badge scans or lead capture forms
- **Outbound LinkedIn campaign follow-ups** – Gather LinkedIn URLs from manual outreach and enrich them into usable CRM leads
- **CRM data enhancement** – Use LinkedIn URLs to fill in missing contact info for existing or imported contacts
- **List building from LinkedIn exports** – Upload a list of LinkedIn profiles (e.g. from Sales Navigator) and turn them into fully enriched contacts in HubSpot

---

## 7. 🛠 Customization Ideas

- 🔁 Add retry logic for failed Surfe enrichment jobs
- 📤 Log enriched contacts into a Google Sheet or Airtable
- 🔍 Add pre-check logic to avoid creating duplicates in HubSpot
- 📊 Extend the flow to generate a basic summary report of enriched vs rejected contacts

---

## 8. ✅ Summary

This workflow turns a basic Google Sheet of LinkedIn URLs into fully enriched, CRM-ready contacts — automatically synced with HubSpot.

Just upload your file.

Let Surfe do the rest.
