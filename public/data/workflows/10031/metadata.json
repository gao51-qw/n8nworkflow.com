  "description": "![image.png](fileId:3040)\n\n## Who’s it for\n\nThis workflow is perfect for content managers, **SEO specialists**, and **website owners** who want to easily analyze their **WordPress** content structure. It automatically fetches posts, categories, and tags from a **WordPress** site and exports them into a **Google Sheet** for further review or optimization.\n\n## What it does\n\nThis automation connects to the `WordPress REST API`, collects data about posts, categories, and tags, and maps the category and tag names directly into each post. It then appends all this enriched data to a `Google Sheet` — providing a quick, clean way to audit your site’s content and taxonomy structure.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Form trigger: Start the workflow by submitting a form with your website URL and the number of posts to analyze.\n2. Fetch WordPress data: The workflow sends three API requests to collect posts, categories, and tags.\n3. Merge data: It combines all the data into one stream using the Merge node.\n4. Code transformation: A Code node replaces category and tag IDs with their actual names.\n5. Google Sheets export: Posts are appended to a Google Sheet with the following columns:\n\t1. URL\n\t2. Title\n\t3. Categories\n\t4. Tags\n5. Completion form: Once the list is created, you’ll get a confirmation message and a link to your sheet.\n\nIf the **WordPress API** isn’t available, the workflow automatically displays an error message to help you troubleshoot.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- A WordPress site with the REST API enabled (`/wp-json/wp/v2/`).\n- A Google account connected to n8n with access to **Google Sheets**.\n- A Google Sheet containing the columns:\n**URL**, **Title**, **Categories**, **Tags**.\n\n\n## How to set up\n\n- Import this workflow into n8n.\n- Connect your **Google Sheets** account under credentials.\n- Make sure your **WordPress** site’s API is accessible publicly.\n- Adjust the **Post limit** (`per_page`) in the form node if needed.\n- Run the workflow and check your **Google Sheet** for results.\n\n## How to customize\n\n- Add additional **WordPress** endpoints (e.g., authors, comments) by duplicating and modifying HTTP Request nodes.\n- Replace **Google Sheets** with another integration (like **Airtable** or **Notion**).\n- Extend the Code node to include **SEO metadata** such as meta descriptions or featured images.",
