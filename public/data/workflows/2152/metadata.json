  "description": "# How it works\nThis template takes a YouTube video ID and identifies potentially engaging moments based on the intensity of specific timestamps 👇\n\n\n![Screenshot 20240228 at 15.51.02.png](fileId:760)\n\nIdeal for vloggers and YouTube content creators, it serves as a foundation for various automations to streamline content calendars or highlight popular moments in your videos. You can leverage it for:\n\n- Automatic processes to analyze YouTube videos and create sizzle reels or clips for social media, particularly effective for microcontent strategies like those endorsed by Gary Vee.\n- Instant alerts via Slack, Telegram, Email, or WhatsApp when significant moments occur in your videos.\n- Utilizing transcripts of these moments with AI to refine content ideas or brainstorm chatbots in your editorial workflow.\n\n\n### Example response from the Workflow-as-an-API \n\nA GET request to `{your instance URL}/webhook/youtube-engaging-moments-extractor?ytID=IZsQqarWXtYy` returns 👇\n\n\n![successresponse.png](fileId:759)\n\nThe workflow generates multiple moments; the screenshot above shows a truncated version.\n\nNot all videos contain timestamp intensity data, the workflow handles this case as well 👇\n![errorresponse.png](fileId:758)\n\n# How to use\n1. Import the template into your n8n workspace or self-hosted instance, then activate the workflow.\n2. Open the Webhook trigger node and copy the Production URL.\n3. In a web browser or any tool capable of consuming HTTP Requests (e.g., native code, Bubble app, n8n workflow, another automation tool, Postman, etc.), pass along the URL parameter `?ytID={youtube video ID}` when invoking the API endpoint.\n\nYour URL should resemble something like `https://acme.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/youtube-engaging-moments-extractor?ytID=IZsQqarWXtYy`.\n\n\n**Keep in mind**\nThis workflow relies on an unofficial YouTube API graciously hosted for free by the folks at lemnoslife.com. It's not recommended for high-volume production usecases. ",
