  "description": "**How it works:**\n\nThis template turns rows in a Google Sheet into polished newsletter drafts in Notion using an AI writing agent. You click **Execute workflow** in n8n. It fetches all rows marked **N8n Status = Pending**, generates a draft from **Newsletter Title** and **About the Newsletter**, creates a Notion page, writes the full draft, then flips the sheet row to **Done** before moving to the next one.\n\n**Before you start (use your own credentials):**\n\n* Create and select **your** credentials in n8n:\n\n  * **Google Sheets** (OAuth2 or Service Account) with access to the target spreadsheet.\n  * **Notion** (Internal Integration) with access to the target database.\n  * **OpenAI** (API Key) for the Chat Model.\n* Replace any placeholders in nodes:\n\n  * Spreadsheet **ID/URL** and sheet/tab name (e.g., `newsletter`).\n  * Notion **Database ID** / Parent and any page or block IDs used by HTTP Request nodes.\n  * OpenAI **model** name if you prefer a different model.\n* Give the Notion integration access to the database (Share → Invite the integration).\n* Do not hard-code secrets in nodes. Store them in n8n **Credentials**.\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n1. **Manual Trigger**\n   Start the run with **When clicking ‘Execute workflow’**.\n\n2. **Fetch pending input (Google Sheets → Get row(s) in sheet)**\n   Read the `newsletter` tab and pull only rows where **N8n Status = Pending**.\n\n3. **Iterate (Split In Batches → Loop Over Items)**\n   Process one sheet row at a time for stable memory use and pacing.\n\n4. **Generate the newsletter (AI Agent + OpenAI Chat Model)**\n\n   * **AI Agent** loads the “System Role Instructions” that define style, sections, and format.\n   * Pass **Newsletter Title** and **About the Newsletter** to the **OpenAI Chat Model** to produce the draft.\n\n5. **Create a Notion page (Notion → Create Page)**\n   Create a page in your **Newsletter Automation** database with the page title set from **Newsletter Title**.\n\n6. **Prepare long content for Notion (Code)**\n   Split the AI output into \\~1,800-character chunks and wrap as Notion paragraph blocks to avoid payload limits.\n\n7. **Write content blocks to Notion (HTTP Request → UpdateNotionBlock)**\n   Send a **PATCH** request to append all generated blocks so the full draft appears on the page.\n\n8. **Mark the sheet row as done (Google Sheets → Update row in sheet)**\n   Update **N8n Status = Done** for the processed **Newsletter Title**.\n\n9. **Continue the loop**\n   Return to **Split In Batches** for the next pending row until none remain.\n\n**Tools integration:**\n\n* **Google Sheets** — input queue and status tracking (`Pending` → `Done`)\n* **OpenAI** — LLM that writes the draft from provided fields\n* **Notion** — destination database for each draft page\n* **n8n Code + HTTP Request** — chunking and Notion API block updates\n\nWant auto-runs? Add a **Cron** trigger before step 2 and keep the flow unchanged.",
