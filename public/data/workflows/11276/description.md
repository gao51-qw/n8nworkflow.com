## Overview

This workflow automatically generates short-form AI videos using both OpenAI Sora 2 Pro and Google Veo 3.1, enhances your idea with Google Gemini, and publishes content across multiple platforms through Blotato.
It’s perfect for creators, brands, UGC teams, and anyone building a high-frequency AI video pipeline.

You can turn a single text idea into fully rendered videos, compare outputs from multiple AI models, and publish everywhere in one automated flow.

## Good to know

* Generating Sora or Veo videos may incur API costs depending on your provider.
* Video rendering time varies by prompt complexity.
* Sora & Veo availability depends on region and account access.
* Blotato must be connected to your social accounts before publishing.
* The workflow includes toggles so you can turn Sora, Veo, or platforms on/off easily.

## How it works

* Your text idea enters through the Chat Trigger.
* Google Gemini rewrites your idea into a detailed, high-quality video prompt.
* The workflow splits into two branches:

  * **Sora Branch**: Generates video via OpenAI Sora 2 Pro, downloads the MP4, and uploads/publishes to YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
  * **Veo Branch**: Generates a video using Google Veo 3.1 (via Wavespeed), retrieves the output link, emails it to you, and optionally uploads it to Blotato for publishing.
* A Config – Toggles node lets you enable or disable models and platforms.
* Optional Google Sheets logging can store video history and metadata.

## How to use

* Send a message to the Chat Trigger to start the workflow.
* Adjust toggles to choose whether you want Sora, Veo, or both.
* Add or remove publishing platforms inside the Blotato nodes.
* Check your email for Veo results or monitor uploads on your social accounts.
* Ideal for automation, batch content creation, and AI-powered video workflows.
