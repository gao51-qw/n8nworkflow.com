🚀 Reddit Crypto Intelligence & Market Spike Detector

Workflow Description

Reddit Crypto Intelligence & Market Spike Detector is an automated market sentiment and price-monitoring workflow that connects social chatter with real-time crypto price analytics.
It continuously scans new posts from r/CryptoCurrency, extracts recently mentioned coins, checks live price movements via CoinGecko, and alerts you on Discord when a significant spike or drop occurs.

This automation empowers traders, analysts, and communities to spot early market trends before they become mainstream — all using free APIs and open data.

How It Works

1. Monitor Reddit Activity

◦ Automatically fetches the latest posts from r/CryptoCurrency using Reddit’s free RSS feed.
◦ Captures trending titles, post timestamps, and mentions of coins or tokens (e.g., $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $PEPE).

2. Extract Coin Mentions

◦ A Code Node parses the feed using regex (\$[A-Za-z0-9]{2,10}) to identify any symbols or tickers discussed.
◦ Removes duplicates and normalizes all results for accurate data mapping.

3. Fetch Market Data

◦ Each detected coin symbol is matched with CoinGecko’s public API to fetch live market data, including current price, market rank, and 24-hour price change.
◦ No API key required — completely free and reliable source.

4. Detect Market Movement

◦ A second Code Node filters the fetched data to identify price movements greater than ±5% within the last 24 hours.
◦ This helps isolate meaningful market action from routine fluctuations.

5. Generate and Send Alerts

◦ When a spike or dip is detected, the workflow composes a rich alert message including:
▪ 💎 Coin name and symbol
▪ 💰 Current price
▪ 📈 24h percentage change
▪ 🕒 Timestamp of detection
◦ The message is sent automatically to your Discord channel using a preconfigured webhook.
