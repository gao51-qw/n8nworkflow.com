### **How It Works**

This template is a workflow that **registers Jira tickets to Pinecone**.  

By combining it with the [Automated Jira Ticket Responses with GPT-4 and Pinecone Knowledge Base](https://creators.n8n.io/workflows/9087) template, you can continuously improve the quality of automated responses in Jira.
