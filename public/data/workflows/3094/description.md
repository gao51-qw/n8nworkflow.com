## Overview
Transform your Bitrix24 Open Line channels with an intelligent chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide accurate, document-based responses to customer inquiries in real-time.

## Use Case
This workflow is designed for organizations that want to enhance their customer support capabilities in Bitrix24 by providing automated, knowledge-based responses to customer inquiries. It's particularly useful for:

- Customer service teams handling repetitive questions
- Support departments with extensive documentation
- Sales teams needing quick access to product information
- Organizations looking to provide 24/7 customer support

## What This Workflow Does

### Smart Document Processing
- Automatically processes uploaded PDF documents
- Splits documents into manageable chunks
- Generates vector embeddings for semantic understanding
- Indexes content for efficient retrieval

### AI-Powered Responses
- Utilizes Google Gemini AI to generate natural language responses
- Constructs answers based on relevant document content
- Maintains conversation context for coherent interactions
- Provides fallback responses when information is not available

### Vector Database Integration
- Stores document embeddings in Qdrant vector database
- Enables semantic search beyond simple keyword matching
- Retrieves the most relevant information for each query
- Maintains a persistent knowledge base that grows over time

### Webhook Handler
- Processes incoming messages from Bitrix24 Open Line channels
- Handles authentication and security validation
- Routes different types of events to appropriate handlers
- Manages session and conversation state

### Event Routing
- Intelligently routes different event types:
  - `ONIMBOTMESSAGEADD`: Processes new user messages
  - `ONIMBOTJOINCHAT`: Handles bot joining a conversation
  - `ONAPPINSTALL`: Manages application installation
  - `ONIMBOTDELETE`: Handles bot deletion

### Document Management
- Organizes processed documents in designated folders
- Tracks document processing status
- Moves indexed documents to appropriate locations
- Maintains document metadata for reference

### Interactive Menu
- Provides menu-based options for common user requests
- Customizable menu items and responses
- Easy navigation for users seeking specific information
- Fallback to operator option when needed

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Webhook Handler**: Receives and validates incoming requests from Bitrix24
2. **Credential Manager**: Securely manages authentication tokens and API keys
3. **Event Router**: Directs events to appropriate processing functions
4. **Document Processor**: Handles document loading, chunking, and embedding
5. **Vector Store**: Qdrant database for storing and retrieving document embeddings
6. **Retrieval System**: Searches for relevant document chunks based on user queries
7. **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini model for generating natural language responses
8. **Response Manager**: Formats and sends responses back to Bitrix24

### Integration Points
- **Bitrix24 API**: For bot registration, message handling, and user interaction
- **Ollama API**: For generating document embeddings
- **Qdrant API**: For vector storage and retrieval
- **Google Gemini API**: For AI-powered response generation
