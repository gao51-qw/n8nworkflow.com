  "description": "Overview\n\nTired of cookie-cutter “AI LinkedIn post generators”? This workflow goes beyond just text generation — it orchestrates the entire lifecycle of a LinkedIn post. From idea capture to deduplication, from GPT-powered drafting to automatic image generation and link storage, it creates ready-to-publish posts while keeping your content unique and audit-friendly.\n\nWhat does this workflow do?\n\nThis workflow:\n\nCaptures Ideas & Briefs – Inputs are logged in Google Sheets with audience, goals, and angles.\n\nDeduplicates Smartly – Avoids repeating hooks or ideas with fuzzy GPT-based dedupe + GSheet logs.\n\nGenerates Posts – GPT (OpenAI) drafts sharp LinkedIn-ready posts based on your brief.\n\nCreates Images – Post hook + body is sent to an Image Gen model (DALL·E / SDXL) → PNG asset.\n\nStores & Links – Final text + image uploaded to Google Drive with shareable links.\n\nAudit Trail – GSheets keeps full history: raw idea, draft, final post, assets, notes.\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nMost “AI post generators” just spit out text. This workflow builds a real publishing pipeline:\n\n🔄 No duplicates → keeps posts fresh & original.\n\n🖼 Images included → auto-generated visuals increase engagement on LinkedIn.\n\n📊 Audit-ready → every post has a traceable log in Sheets.\n\n⚡ Fast iteration → from half-baked thought → polished post in minutes.\n\nTools used\n\nn8n (Orchestrator): Automates triggers, merges, retries, and Google connectors.\n\nOpenAI (LLM): Idea generation, drafting, fuzzy dedupe, and voice conformity.\n\nGoogle Sheets: Source of truth — stores ideas, dedupe logs, audit trail.\n\nGoogle Drive: Stores rendered images and shares links for publishing.\n\nImage Generation (DALL·E / SDXL): Creates header graphics from hook + body.\n\nWho is this for?\n\n🧑‍💻 Product Managers / Founders who want to post consistently but don’t have time.\n\n🎨 Creators who want to add unique visuals without hiring a designer.\n\n⚙️ n8n Builders who want to see how AI + automation + storage can be stitched into one pipeline.\n\nWorkflow Highlights\n\n✅ Full content pipeline (ideas → images → final copy).\n\n✅ GPT-based fuzzy dedupe to avoid repetition.\n\n✅ Auto-generated images for higher engagement.\n\n✅ Clean logs in Google Sheets for future reuse & audits.\n\n✅ Ready-to-publish LinkedIn post in minutes.",
