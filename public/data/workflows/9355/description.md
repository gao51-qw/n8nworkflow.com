Ideal for marketing teams, product managers, PR professionals, and competitive intelligence analysts, this solution turns noisy social feeds into clear, actionable summaries—automated and customized to your needs.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger:** A daily cron node initiates the workflow.
2. **Fetch User ID:** The workflow uses the X API to retrieve the user ID based on the provided username. This step is necessary because the tweet retrieval endpoint requires a user ID, not a username.
3. **Fetch Tweets:** Using the extracted user ID, the workflow queries the X API for recent tweets from the selected account.
4. **Clean Data:** Filters out replies, retweets, and any irrelevant content to ensure only meaningful tweets are summarized.
5. **Summarize:** GPT-4 processes the cleaned tweet content and generates a concise, insightful summary.
6. **Send Email:** The Gmail node sends the final summary to your inbox or chosen recipient.
