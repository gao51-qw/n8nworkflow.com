  "description": "\n# Automating File (Image) Upload to Postimages.org\n\n## Use Case\nManually uploading screenshots or other image files to hosting platforms like Postimages.org can be tedious and time-consuming. This automation simplifies the process by automatically uploading an image to Postimages.org and validating the result, which is especially useful for repetitive QA tasks, reporting, or archiving visual web data.\n\n## What This Automation Does\nThis automation uploads a screenshot to [Postimages.org](https://postimages.org/) using the following steps:\n\n- Creates a browser session using Airtop.\n- Navigates to the Postimages.org upload page.\n- Takes a screenshot using the browser session.\n- Uploads the screenshot to the site via the \"Choose images\" button.\n- Waits briefly to ensure upload processing.\n- Captures a post-upload screenshot for validation.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Session Initialization**: Starts a browser session using the Airtop node.\n2. **Navigation**: Opens the URL `https://postimages.org/` in a new window.\n3. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes a screenshot to use for upload.\n4. **File Upload**: Uploads the screenshot to the site using the file upload interaction.\n5. **Validation**: Waits 5 seconds and then captures a second screenshot to confirm the image was uploaded successfully.\n\n## Setup Requirements\n1. [Airtop API Key](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys) — required for session creation and browser interactions.\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Customize for Other Sites**: Adapt this workflow to automate file uploads to different platforms.\n- **Integrate with Reporting Tools**: Combine this automation with workflows that require image reporting or archiving.\n- **Enhance Validation**: Add logic to parse the upload confirmation or retrieve the image URL programmatically for logging or sharing.\n\nRead more about how to [automate file uploads to the web](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/simple-file-upload-n8n)\n",
