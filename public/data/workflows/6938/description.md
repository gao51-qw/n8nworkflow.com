# Outlook to OneDrive
This workflow automates the process of saving binary attachments from Outlook emails into newly created folders in OneDrive. It's ideal for users who regularly receive files and need them organized into separate folders without manual intervention. Each folder is automatically named based on the email subject and the current timestamp, allowing all attachments from that email to be stored inside the corresponding folder. This is particularly useful for streamlining document workflows, improving file traceability, and reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks like organizing client submissions, invoices, or internal reports.

The configuration and setup of the workflow can be customized to meet the business or personal needs of the user. Its purpose is to automatically process binary attachments from Outlook emails and upload them to dynamically created folders in OneDrive.
