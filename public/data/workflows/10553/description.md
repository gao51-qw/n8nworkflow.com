Key Features:

⚡ Fully Automated: Triggers instantly on new QuickBooks invoices.

🧾 Custom Branding: Adds your logo and signature from public URLs.

🎨 Modern PDF Design: Clean, professional multi-page layout with smart totals and “Page X of Y” footers.

📧 Automatic Emailing: Sends the final PDF in a formatted email to your customer.

Requirements:
QuickBooks Online, n8n instance, Gotenberg (HTML→PDF converter), and public URLs for logo/signature.
