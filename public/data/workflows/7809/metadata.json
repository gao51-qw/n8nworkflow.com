  "description": "\n\nThis **n8n workflow** enables teams to automate and standardize multi-step onboarding or messaging workflows using **Google Sheets**, **Forms**, **Gmail**, and dynamic logic powered by **Code** and **Switch** nodes. It ensures the right email is sent at the right step, tracks progress in Google Sheets, and handles errors or escalations.\n\n---\n\n## **🧑‍💼 Who is this for?**\n\n- HR and PeopleOps teams managing candidate or employee onboarding processes\n    \n- Customer success or onboarding teams handling structured, step-based journeys\n    \n- Any team using Google Sheets as a lightweight CRM or workflow tracker\n    \n\n---\n\n## **🧩 What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\n  \n\nCoordinating multi-step onboarding or communication flows using spreadsheets and email can quickly become error-prone. This workflow:\n\n- Dynamically detects the current step and status from a Google Sheet\n    \n- Sends the right message at the right time\n    \n- Updates statuses and creates next steps\n    \n- Handles errors with escalation logic\n    \n\n---\n\n## **⚙️ What this workflow does**\n\n1. **Trigger via Form or Manual Execution**\n    \n    - Users can fill a web form or run the workflow manually.\n        \n    \n2. **Read Google Sheets**\n    \n    - Retrieves step definitions and user progress from two sheets:\n        \n        - One for message templates\n            \n        - One for user step/status tracking\n            \n        \n    \n3. **Generate Message Table**\n    \n    - Uses custom JavaScript to parse and structure message templates based on step and message type (sent, completed, error).\n        \n    \n4. **Determine User Step**\n    \n    - A **Switch node** checks the user’s current step and status.\n        \n    - Logic branches into the correct flow for message sending and verification.\n        \n    \n5. **Send Message**\n    \n    - Message variables are replaced using a **Code** node.\n        \n    - Final message is sent via Gmail or another workflow (using Execute Workflow).\n        \n    \n6. **Update Sheets**\n    \n    - Marks the step as completed or passed.\n        \n    - Creates the next step in the sheet with updated status.\n        \n    \n7. **Handle Errors**\n    \n    - If the step fails, an error message is sent to the responsible admin.\n        \n    \n\n---\n\n## **🛠️ Setup**\n\n1. **Connect Google Sheets and Gmail**:\n    \n    - Ensure credentials are configured in n8n.\n        \n    \n2. **Prepare Sheets**:\n    \n    - One sheet for messages with steps/types/subjects/content. You can copy the one from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_fUSV9zJo8Ya6ulvCOon2wjoeEmOwDFrpK1Xxa9gmw/edit?usp=sharing)\n        \n    - One sheet for tracking users and their current step/status. You can copy the one from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBLJNt8hAXNkqj6lfwQilBr9FCRxjT3j0r0Ni6cgoYA/edit?usp=sharing)\n        \n    \n3. **Customize Webform**:\n    \n    - Use the provided form to capture First Name, Last Name, and Email.\n        \n    \n4. **Connect to Your Email Templates**:\n    \n    - Ensure your message structure follows the expected JSON format by step and type.\n        \n    \n\n---\n\n## **✏️ How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n- **Add More Steps**: Expand the Switch logic and template sheet for more steps.\n    \n- **Use Different Channels**: Replace Gmail with Slack, Telegram, or another messaging node.\n    \n- **Change Form Fields**: Adjust the FormTrigger node to match your onboarding fields.\n    \n- **Custom Error Logic**: Customize escalation emails, including admin routing or Slack alerts.\n    \n- **Integrate with Databases**: Swap Google Sheets with Airtable, PostgreSQL, or Notion.\n    \n\n---\n\nThis workflow is ideal for automating repetitive, step-based processes involving human communication. It’s modular, extensible, and powered by spreadsheet-driven logic.",
