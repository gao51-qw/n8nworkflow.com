++**How it Works:**++
This RSS reader retrieves links from a Google Sheets file and goes through each link to retrieve the messages that are younger than 3 days, then saves them in a second Google Sheets file and then deletes all older entries in the second Google Sheets file!

***==The retrieval can take a while due to the Google API block prevention, depending on the number of news feeds that were retrieved!==***

***Detailed Description is in the sticky Notes from the Workflow!***
