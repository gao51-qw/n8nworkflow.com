This workflow demonstrates how to use **n8n** to build a complete, self-contained CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application without relying on any external server or hosting. It not only acts as the **backend**, handling all CRUD operations through **Webhook endpoints**, but also **serves a fully functional HTML Single Page Application (SPA)** directly via a webhook response.

**Redis** is used as a lightweight data store, providing fast and simple key-value storage with auto-incremented IDs. Because both the frontend (HTML app) and backend (API endpoints) are managed entirely within a single n8n workflow, you can quickly prototype or deploy small tools without additional infrastructure.

This approach is ideal for:
- Rapidly creating no-code or low-code applications
- Running fully browser-based tools served directly from n8n
- Teaching or demonstrating n8n + Redis integration in a single workflow


## Features
- Add new item with **auto-incremented ID**
- Edit existing item
- Delete specific item
- Reset all data (clear storage and reset autoincrement id)
- Single HTML frontend for demonstration (no framework required)

# Setup Instructions

## 1. Prerequisites
Before importing and running the workflow, make sure you have:
- A running **n8n** instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- A running **Redis** server (local or remote)

## 2. API Path Setup

For the REST API, use a consistent `path`. For example, if you choose `items` as the path:

- **2a. Get All Items**  
  - **Method**: `GET`  
  - **Endpoint**: `items`

- **2b. Add Item**  
  - **Method**: `POST`  
  - **Endpoint**: `items`

- **2c. Edit Item**  
  - **Method**: `PUT`  
  - **Endpoint**: `items`

- **2d. Delete Item**  
  - **Method**: `DELETE`  
  - **Endpoint**: `items`

- **2e. Reset Items**  
  - **Method**: `POST`  
  - **Endpoint**: `items-reset`


## 3. Configure the API URL

Set the `API URL` in the **SET API URL** node. Use your n8n webhook URL, for example:  
`https://yourn8n.com/webhook/items`

## 4. Run the HTML App

Once everything is set:
1. Open the webhook URL for the HTML app in a browser.
2. The CRUD interface will load and connect to the API endpoints automatically.
3. You can now add, edit, delete, or reset items directly from the web interface.


# Workflows
## 1. Render the HTML CRUD App

This webhook serves a self-contained HTML Single Page Application (SPA) for basic CRUD operations. The HTML content is returned directly in the webhook response.

This setup is ideal for lightweight, browser-based tools without external hosting.

### How to Use
- Open the webhook URL in a browser
- The CRUD interface will load and connect to the data source via API calls
- Before using, make sure to edit the `api_url` in the `SET API URL` node to match your webhook endpoint


## 2a. REST API: Get All Items

This webhook handles retrieving all saved items from Redis.
Each item is returned with its corresponding ID and associated data (e.g., name). This endpoint is used by the HTML CRUD App to display the full list of items.

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Function**: Fetches all items stored in Redis and returns them as a JSON array

## 2b. REST API: Add Item

This webhook handles the **Add Item** functionality.
This endpoint is typically called by the HTML CRUD App when adding a new item.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**: `{ "name": "item name" }`
- **Function**: Generates an auto-incremented ID using Redis and saves the data under that ID

## 2c. REST API: Edit Item

This webhook handles updating an existing item in Redis.

- **Method**: `PUT`
- **Request Body**: `{ "id": 1, "name": "Updated Item Name" }`
- **Function**: Finds the item by the given `id` and updates its data in Redis

## 2d. REST API: Delete Item

This webhook handles deleting a specific item from Redis.

- **Method**: `DELETE`
- **Request Body**: `{ "id": 1 }`
- **Function**: Removes the item with the given `id` from Redis

## 2e. REST API: Reset Items

This webhook handles resetting all data in the application.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Function**:
  - Deletes all stored items from Redis
  - Resets the auto-increment ID by deleting the data in Redis
