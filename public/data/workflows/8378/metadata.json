  "description": "\nThis automated workflow generates a **video featuring a talking AI avatar from a single image and automatically publishes it to TikTok** with [Postiz](https://postiz.com/?ref=n3witalia).\n\nThe process involves two main AI services chained together: **Elevenlabs v3** and **Infinitalk**.\n\n---\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n* ✅ **Full Automation** – From text input to TikTok publication, the process is completely automated.\n* ✅ **Time-Saving** – Eliminates manual video editing, voice-over recording, and social media posting.\n* ✅ **Scalable** – Can generate multiple avatar videos daily with minimal effort.\n* ✅ **Customizable** – Flexible inputs (image, voice, text, prompts) allow adaptation for different content types (weather forecasts, product promos, tutorials, etc.).\n* ✅ **Engagement-Oriented** – Uses AI to optimize video titles for TikTok, increasing chances of visibility and audience interaction.\n* ✅ **Consistent Branding** – Ensures uniform style and messaging across multiple video posts.\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Generation:** The workflow starts by sending a predefined text script and a selected voice (e.g., \"Alice\") to the Fal.ai service, which utilizes ElevenLabs' AI to generate a high-quality audio file. The workflow then polls the API until the audio generation is `COMPLETED` and retrieves the URL of the generated audio file.\n\n2.  **Talking Avatar Video Generation:** The workflow takes a static image URL and the newly created audio URL and sends them to another Fal.ai service (Infinitalk). This AI model animates the avatar in the image to lip-sync and match the provided audio. A prompt guides the avatar's expression (e.g., \"You are a girl giving a weather forecast and you must be expressive\"). The workflow again polls for status until the video is `COMPLETED`.\n\n3.  **Title Generation & Publishing:** Once the video is ready, its URL is fetched. Simultaneously, an OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) node generates an optimized, engaging title (under 60 characters) for the TikTok post based on the original script and avatar prompt. The final video file is downloaded and uploaded to [Postiz](https://postiz.com/?ref=n3witalia) (a social media scheduling service), which finally posts it to a pre-configured TikTok account.\n\n---\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nBefore executing this workflow, you must configure the following third-party service credentials and node parameters within n8n:\n\n1.  **Fal.ai API Credentials:** Create an account on Fal.ai and obtain an API key. Create a new credential of type \"HTTP Header Auth\" in n8n named `\"Fal.run API\"`. The key should be placed in the `Value` field, and the `Header Name` must be set to `Authorization`. The value should be `Key &lt;YOUR_FAL_AI_API_KEY&gt;`.\n\n2.  **OpenAI API Credentials:** You need an OpenAI API key. Create a credential in n8n of type \"OpenAI API\", name it (e.g., `\"OpenAi account\"`), and enter your API key.\n\n3.  **Postiz API Credentials:** Create an account on [Postiz](https://postiz.com/), connect your TikTok account, and get your API key from the Postiz dashboard. In n8n, create an \"HTTP Header Auth\" credential named `\"Postiz\"`. Set the `Header Name` to `X-API-Key` and the `Value` to your Postiz API key. Also, create a \"Postiz API\" credential in n8n and enter the same API key.\n\n4.  **Configure [Postiz](https://postiz.com/?ref=n3witalia) Node:** In the **\"TikTok\" (Postiz)** node, you must replace `\"XXX\"` in the `integrationId` field with the actual ID of your connected TikTok account from your Postiz dashboard.\n\n5.  **(Optional) Customize Inputs:** You can modify the default values in the **\"Set text input\"** node (the script and voice) and the **\"Set Video Params\"** node (the `image_url` and the `prompt` for the avatar's expression) to create different videos without changing the workflow's structure.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).",
