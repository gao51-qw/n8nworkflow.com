  "description": "# Automatically add Travel time blockers before Appointments\n\nThis bot automatically adds Travel time blockers to your calendar, so you never come late to an appointment again.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n* **Trigger**: The workflow is initiated daily at 7 AM by a \"Schedule Trigger\".\n* **AI Agent**: An \"AI Agent\" node orchestrates the main logic. \n* **Fetch events**: It uses the `get_calendar_events` tool to retrieve all events scheduled for the current day.\n* **Identify events with location**: It then filters these events to identify those that have a specified location.\n* **Check for existing travel time Blockers**: For each event with a location, it checks if a Travel time blocker already exists. Events that *do not* have such a blocker are marked for processing.\n* **Calculate travel time**: Using the `Google Directions API` it determines how lot it takes to get to the location of the event. The starting location is by default your **Home Address**, unless there is a previous event within 2 hours before the event, in which case it will use the location of that previous event.\n* **Create Travel time blocker**: Finally, it uses the `create_calendar_event` tool to create the Travel time blocker with a duration equal to the calculated travel time + 10 minutes for buffer.\n\n![image.png](fileId:1896)\n\n\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. Set Variables\n\t1. **Home address**\n\t2. **Blocker name**\n\t3. **Mode of Transportation**\n2. Connect your **LLM Provider**\n3. Connect your **Google Calendar**\n4. Connect your **Google Directions API**",
