# Startup Funding Research Automation with Claude, Perplexity AI, and Airtable

## How it works
This intelligent workflow automatically discovers and analyzes recently funded startups by:
1. Monitoring multiple news sources (TechCrunch and VentureBeat) for funding announcements
2. Using AI to extract key funding details (company name, amount raised, investors)
3. Conducting automated deep research on each company through perplexity deep research or jina deep search.
4. Organizing all findings into a structured Airtable database for easy access and analysis

## Set up steps (10-15 minutes)
1. Connect your news feed sources (TechCrunch and VentureBeat). Could be extended. These were easy to scrape and this data can be expensive.
2. Set up your AI service credentials (Claude and Perplexity or jina which has generous free tier)
3. Connect your Airtable account and create a base with appropriate fields (can be imported from my base) or see structure below.

## Notes
I found that by using perplexity via open router, we lose access to the sources, as they are not stored in the same location as the report itself so I opted to use perplexity API via HTTP node.

For using perplexity and or jina you have to configure header auth as described in [Header Auth - n8n Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest/#using-header-auth)
