## Who's it for

This template is perfect for content creators, researchers, marketers, and Reddit enthusiasts who want to stay updated on specific topics without manually browsing Reddit. If you need curated, AI-summarized Reddit insights delivered directly to your Telegram, this workflow automates the entire process.

## What it does

This workflow transforms your Telegram into a powerful Reddit search engine with AI-powered curation. Simply send any keyword to your Telegram bot, and it will:

- Search Reddit across 4 different sorting methods (top, hot, relevance) to capture diverse perspectives
- Automatically remove duplicate posts from multiple search results
- Filter posts based on quality metrics (minimum 50 upvotes, recent content within 15 days, non-empty text)
- Extract key information: title, upvotes, subreddit, publication date, URL, and content
- Generate a clean, Telegram-formatted summary using Google Gemini AI
- Deliver structured results with direct links back to you instantly

The AI summary includes post titles, upvote counts, timestamps, brief insights, and direct Reddit links—all formatted for easy mobile reading.

## How it works

**Step 1: Telegram Trigger**
User sends a search keyword via Telegram (e.g., "voice AI agents")

**Step 2: Parallel Reddit Searches**
Four simultaneous Reddit API calls search with different sorting algorithms:
- Top posts (all-time popularity)
- Hot posts (trending now)
- Relevance (best keyword matches)
- Top posts (duplicate for broader coverage)

**Step 3: Merge & Deduplicate**
All search results combine into one stream, then a JavaScript code node removes duplicate posts by comparing post IDs

**Step 4: Field Extraction**
The Edit Fields node extracts and formats:
- Post title
- Upvote count
- Subreddit name and subscriber count
- Publication date (converted from Unix timestamp)
- Reddit URL
- Post content (selftext)

**Step 5: Quality Filtering**
The Filter node applies three conditions:
- Minimum 50 upvotes (ensures quality)
- Non-empty content (excludes link-only posts)
- Posted within last 15 days (ensures freshness)

**Step 6: Data Aggregation**
All filtered posts aggregate into a single dataset for AI processing

**Step 7: AI Summarization**
Google Gemini AI analyzes the aggregated posts and generates a concise, Telegram-formatted summary with:
- Emoji indicators for better readability
- Point-wise breakdown of top 5-7 posts
- Upvote counts and relative timestamps
- Brief 1-2 sentence summaries
- Direct Reddit links

**Step 8: Delivery**
The formatted summary sends back to the user's Telegram chat
