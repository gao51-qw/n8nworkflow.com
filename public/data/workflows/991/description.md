**Autopilot Trigger node:**  The Autopilot Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a new contact is added in Autopilot.

**Set node:** We use the Set node to ensure that only the data that we set in this node gets passed on to the next nodes in the workflow.

**Airtable node:** This node will store the data coming from the previous node in a table in Airtable.
