  "description": "### Who this is for?\nThis workflow is designed for professionals and teams who need real-time, structured insights from Google Search results without manual effort.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving? \nThis n8n workflow solves the problem of automating Google Search result extraction, cleanup, summarization, and AI-enhanced formatting for downstream use like sending the results to a webhook or another system. \n\n### What this workflow does\n\n1. Automates Google Search via Bright Data\n - Uses Bright Data’s proxy-based SERP API to run a Google Search query programmatically. \n - Makes the process repeatable and scriptable with different search terms and regions/zones.\n\n2. Cleans and Extracts Useful Content\n - The **Google Search Data Extractor** uses LLM based cleaning to remove HTML/CSS/JS from the response and extract pure text data. \n - Converts messy, unstructured web content into structured, machine-readable format.\n\n3. Summarizes Search Results\nThrough the Gemini Flash + Summarization Chain, it generates a concise summary of the search results. Ideal for users who don’t have time to read full pages of search results.\n\n4. Formats Data Using AI Agent\nThe AI Agent acts like a virtual assistant that: \n- Understands search results\n- Formats them in a readable, JSON-compatible form\n- Prepares them for webhook delivery\n\n5. Delivers Results to Webhook\nSends the final summary + structured search result to a webhook (could be your app, a Slack bot, Google Sheets, or CRM).\n\n### Setup\n\n- Sign up at [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/).\n- Navigate to Proxies & Scraping and create a new Web Unlocker zone by selecting Web Unlocker API under Scraping Solutions.\n- In n8n, configure the Header Auth account under Credentials (Generic Auth Type: Header Authentication).\n![Header Authentication.png](fileId:1234)\nThe Value field should be set with the\n**Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXX**. The XXXXXXXXXXXXXX should be replaced by the Web Unlocker Token.\n- A Google Gemini API key (or access through Vertex AI or proxy).\n- Update the Google Search query as you wish by navigating to the **Set Google Search Query** node.\n- Update the **Webhook HTTP Request** node with the Webhook endpoint of your choice.\n\n### How to customize This Workflow to your needs\n\n**1. Change the Search Input**\n\nDefault: It searches a fixed query or dataset.\n\nCustomize:\n- Accept input from a Google Sheet, Airtable, or a form.\n - Auto-trigger searches based on keywords or schedules.\n\n**2. Customize Summarization Style (LLM Output)**\n\nDefault: General summary using Google Gemini or OpenAI.\n\nCustomize:\n\n- Add tone: formal, casual, technical, executive-summary, etc.\n\n- Focus on specific sections: pricing, competitors, FAQs, etc.\n\n- Translate the summaries into multiple languages.\n\n- Add bullet points, pros/cons, or insight tags.\n\n**3.Choose Where the Results Go**\n\nOptions:\n\n- Email, Slack, Notion, Airtable, Google Docs, or a dashboard.\n\n- Auto-create content drafts for WordPress or newsletters.\n\n- Feed into CRM notes or attach to Salesforce leads.\n",
