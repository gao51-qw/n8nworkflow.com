### 🧠 How It Works
• User submits a product title via a form.  
• The workflow uses Google Custom Search to gather real-time competitor content based on that title.  
• Titles, snippets, and keywords are extracted from the search results.  
• This information is sent to a language model (Google Gemini via LangChain) to generate:  
   - SEO-optimized metadata (Title, Description, Keywords)  
   - A compelling product description tailored for marketing  
• The AI-generated content is then parsed and organized into two categories: SEO data and product content.  
• The structured output is saved automatically into a connected Google Sheet for easy access or further automation.
