This n8n workflow automates email blasts with follow-ups and response tracking by reading contact data from a Google Sheet daily, looping through contacts to send personalized emails based on follow-up stages via Gmail, updating the sheet with status changes, and monitoring replies for logging.

## Why Use It

This workflow streamlines email marketing campaigns by automating personalized email distribution, managing follow-up sequences, and tracking responses without manual intervention, saving time, improving engagement, and providing actionable insights into contact interactions.

## How to Import It

1. **Download the Workflow JSON**: Obtain the workflow file from the n8n template or create it based on this document.
2. **Import into n8n**: In your n8n instance, go to "Workflows," click the three dots, select "Import from File," and upload the JSON.
3. **Configure Credentials**: Set up Gmail and Google Sheets credentials in n8n.
4. **Run the Workflow**: Activate the scheduled trigger and test with a sample Google Sheet.
