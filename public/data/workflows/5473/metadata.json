  "description": "This AI-powered workflow reads emails, understands the request using an LLM, and creates structured Jira issues.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n- Poll for new emails every 5 minutes; ensure Gmail/IMAP is properly configured.  \n- AI analysis requires a reliable LLM model (e.g., Chat Model or AI Tool).\n\n### Workflow Process\n\n- Trigger the workflow with the `Check for New Emails Gmail Trigger` node.  \n- Fetch full email content using the `Fetch Full Email Content get message` node.  \n- Analyze email content with the `Analyze Email & Extract Tasks` node using AI.  \n- Parse the AI-generated JSON output into tasks with the `Parse JSON Output from AI` node.  \n- Create the main Jira issue with the `Jira - Create Main Issue create: issue` node.  \n- Split subtasks from JSON and create them with the `Split Subtasks JSON Items` and `Create Subtasks create: issue` nodes.\n\n### Usage Guide\n\n- Import the workflow into n8n and configure Gmail and Jira credentials.  \n- Test with a sample email to ensure ticket creation and subtask assignment.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Gmail/IMAP credentials for email polling  \n- Jira API credentials with issue creation permissions  \n\n### Customization Options\n\nAdjust the `Analyze Email & Extract Tasks` node to refine AI task extraction or modify the polling frequency in the trigger node.",
