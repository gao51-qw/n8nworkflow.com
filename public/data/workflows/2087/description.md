[Video for workflow process](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF8PpnKJ0Q/2egm6F7B9H0Vm_8KFrghPw/watch?utm_content=DAF8PpnKJ0Q&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

This workflow facilitates efficient data collection and management by leveraging the capabilities of various nodes within the n8n platform. It commences with the n8n Form Trigger node, where users provide their name, location, and email address. Subsequently, the data seamlessly flows through nodes like Google Sheets, Code, Set, Airtable, Gmail, and Gmail1 for processing and storage.

- **n8n Form Trigger:** Gathers user input data, including Name, City, and Email.
- **Google Sheets:** Manages data operations related to Google Sheets.
- **Code:** Executes JavaScript code to manipulate data fields.
- **Set:** Formats and sets data values for further processing.
- **Airtable:** Facilitates data operations specific to Airtable.
- **Gmail:** Sends custom emails to the provided Email address.
- **Gmail:** Sends additional emails using different templates.

Each node within the workflow performs specialized tasks such as extracting date and time fields, formatting data, appending it to Google Sheets and Airtable, and sending personalized emails to the submitter. This streamlined process ensures effective handling of collected information and enhances overall data management efficiency.
