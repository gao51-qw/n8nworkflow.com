# 🎧 IT Voice Support Automation Bot – Telegram Voice Message to JIRA ticket with OpenAI Whisper

&gt; Automatically process IT support requests submitted via Telegram voice messages by transcribing, extracting structured data, creating a JIRA ticket, and notifying relevant parties.

## 🧑‍💼 Who’s it for

- Internal teams that handle IT support but want to streamline voice-based requests.
- Employees who prefer using mobile/voice to report incidents or ask for support.
- Organizations aiming to integrate conversational AI into existing support workflows.

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. A user sends a voice message to a Telegram bot.
2. The system checks whether it’s an audio message.
3. If valid, the audio is:
   - Downloaded
   - Transcribed via OpenAI Whisper
   - Backed up to Google Drive
4. The transcription and file metadata are merged.
5. The merged content is processed through an **AI Agent** (GPT) to extract structured request info.
6. A JIRA ticket is created using the extracted data.
7. The IT team is notified via Slack (or other channels).
8. The requester receives a Telegram confirmation message with the JIRA ticket link.
9. If the input is not audio, a polite rejection message is sent.

## 📌 Key Features

- Supports voice-based ticket creation
- Accurate transcription using Whisper
- Context-aware request parsing using GPT-4.1 mini
- Fully automated ticket creation in JIRA

- Cloud backup of original voice messages (Google Drive)
