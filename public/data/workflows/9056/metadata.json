  "description": "## Overview\nUse this workflow to create SEO-friendly outlines based on articles that do well in Google. \n\nEnter a keyword, and the workflow scrapes the top results, scrapes the content, analyzes it with AI, and builds a MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) outline. \n\nIt’s useful for content creators and SEO specialists who want relevant, well-structured content.\n\n## How it works\n- Accepts a keyword submitted through a form\n- Uses the SerpAPI to get top Google results for a chosen country\n- Collects the top five URLs. We use five because we expect some to fail at the scraping stage\n- Scrapes each URL separately\n- Uses the first three articles to fit the AI model’s context window\n- Extracts the main text from the page body\n- Converts HTML to Markdown to get rid of tags and attributes.\n- Combines the cleaned text into a single list for AI processing\n- Analyzes the content with an AI language model to find common topics and headings\n- Generates an SEO-focused outline based on the most frequent topics\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Sign up for a [SerpAPI account](https://serpapi.com/) (free tier available)\n2. Create an [OpenAI account](https://openai.com/api/) and get an API key\n3. Set up your credentials within N8N\n4. Run the workflow and enter your keyword in the form.\n5. The workflow will generate an SEO-friendly outline for your content\n\n## Improvement ideas\n- Add another LLM to turn the outline into an article\n- Use the Google docs API to add the outline to a Google doc\n- Enright the outline with data from Perplexity or Tavily\n",
