  "title": "Get custom_fields from the Stripe API",
  "description": "The Stripe API does not provide custom fields in invoice or charge data. So you have to get it from the [**Checkout Sessions**](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) endpoint.\n\nBut that endpoint is not easy for begginners. It has dictionary parameters and pagination settings.\n\nThis workflows solves that problem by having a preconfigured GET request that gets **all the checkout sessions from the last 7 days**.\n\nIt then transforms the data to make it easier to work with and allows you to **filter by the custom_fields** you want to get.\n\n### Want to generate Stripe invoices automatically?\n\nOpen 👉 [**this workflow**](https://n8n.io/workflows/2675)\n.\n\n### Check out my other templates\n[**https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/**](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/)",
