# Automated Research Report Generation with OpenAI, Wikipedia, Google Search, Gmail/Telegram and PDF Output
---

## Description

### What Problem Does This Solve? 🛠️
This workflow automates the process of **generating professional research reports** for researchers, students, and professionals. It eliminates manual research and report formatting by aggregating data, generating content with AI, and delivering the report as a PDF via Gmail or Telegram. **Target audience**: Researchers, students, educators, and professionals needing quick, formatted research reports.

### What Does It Do? 🌟
- Aggregates research data from Wikipedia, Google Search, and SerpApi.
- Refines user queries and generates structured content using OpenAI.
- Converts the content into a professional HTML report, then to PDF.
- Sends the PDF report via Gmail or Telegram.

### Key Features 📋
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple sources.
- AI-driven content generation with OpenAI.
- Automated HTML-to-PDF conversion for professional reports.
- Flexible delivery via Gmail or Telegram.
- Error handling for robust execution.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites ⚙️
- **n8n Instance**: Self-hosted or cloud n8n instance.
- **API Credentials**:
  - **OpenAI API**: API key with GPT model access, stored in n8n credentials.
  - **SerpApi (Google Search)**: API key from SerpApi, stored in n8n credentials (do not hardcode in nodes).
  - **Gmail API**: Credentials from Google Cloud Console with Gmail scope.
  - **Telegram API**: Bot token from BotFather on Telegram.

### Installation Steps 📦
1. **Import the Workflow**:
   - Copy the workflow JSON from the "Template Code" section below.
   - Import it into n8n via "Import from File" or "Import from URL".
2. **Configure Credentials**:
   - Add API credentials in n8n’s Credentials section for OpenAI, SerpApi, Gmail, and Telegram.
   - Assign credentials to respective nodes. For example:
     - In the `SerpApi Google Search` node, use n8n credentials for SerpApi: `api_key={{ $credentials.SerpApiKey }}`.
     - In the `Send Research PDF on Gmail` node, use Gmail credentials.
     - In the `Send PDF to Telegram` node, use Telegram bot credentials.
3. **Set Up Nodes**:
   - **OpenAI Nodes** (`Research AI Agent`, `OpenAI Chat Model`, `OpenAI Chat Middle Memory`): Update the model (e.g., `gpt-4o`) and prompt as needed.
   - **Input Validation** (`Input Validation` node): Ensure your input query format matches the expected structure (e.g., `topic: "AI ethics"`).
   - **Delivery Options** (`Send Research PDF on Gmail`, `Send PDF to Telegram`): Configure recipient email or Telegram chat ID.
4. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Run the workflow by clicking the "Test Workflow" node.
   - Verify that the research report PDF is generated and sent via Gmail or Telegram.
