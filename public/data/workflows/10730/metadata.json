  "description": "## Automated Weekly Newsletter for E-commerce Promotions (based on Algolia)\n\nThis workflow automatically sends a beautifully designed HTML newsletter every Sunday at 8 AM, featuring products currently on sale from your Algolia-powered e-commerce store.\n\n## Who's it for\n\nPerfect for e-commerce store owners, marketing teams, and anyone running promotional campaigns who wants to automate their weekly newsletter without relying on expensive email marketing platforms.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Triggers every Sunday at 8:00 AM** - Scheduled to start each new promotion week\n2. **Fetches discounted products** - Queries your Algolia index for 6 products marked with `on_sale:true`\n3. **Calculates promotion dates** - Automatically generates the week's date range (Sunday to Saturday)\n4. **Builds HTML newsletter** - Populates a responsive email template with product images, prices, and descriptions\n5. **Retrieves subscribers** - Pulls the latest subscriber list from your Google Sheets\n6. **Sends personalized emails** - Delivers the newsletter to all subscribers via Gmail\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~15 minutes**\n\n1. Connect your **Algolia credentials** (Search API key + Application ID)\n2. Update the **Algolia index name** to match your store (currently set to `dogtreats_prod_products`)\n3. Create a **Google Sheet** with subscriber emails (column named \"Email\")\n4. Connect your **Google Sheets** and **Gmail** accounts\n5. (Optional) Customize the HTML template colors and branding to match your store\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Algolia account with a product index containing `on_sale`, `price_eur`, `original_price_eur`, `image`, `name`, and `description` fields\n- Google Sheets with subscriber list\n- Gmail account for sending emails\n\n## How to customize\n\n- **Change promotion criteria**: Modify the filter in \"Request products from Algolia\" node (e.g., `category:shoes` instead of `on_sale:true`)\n- **Adjust product count**: Change `hitsPerPage` value (currently 6)\n- **Modify schedule**: Update the trigger node to run on different days/times\n- **Personalize email design**: Edit the HTML template node to match your brand colors and style\n- **Add unsubscribe logic**: Extend the workflow to handle unsubscribe requests\n\n💡 **Pro tip**: Use the manual execution button to test the workflow mid-week - it's \"smart\" enough to calculate the current promotion week even when not running on Sunday.",
