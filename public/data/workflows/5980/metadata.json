  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## How it Works:\n1. - Accepts a domain from a web form\n2. - Generates a list of Google dorks targeting that domain\n3. - Scrapes Google search results for each dork \n4. - Filters out junk links (Google internal, non-http)\n5. - Formats valid results as a markdown report\n6. - Emails the report to your inbox\n\n## For this workflow you will need to configure credentials in n8n as well as create a Parsera.io agent:\n\n### 1. AI Scraper Account\n- Create an account for: https://app.parsera.io\n- Create an agent named \"Google\" and use the URL https://google.com\n- Copy/Paste your Parsera.io API key to the 'Scrape with agent' node in the n8n workflow\n\n### 2. Gmail OAuth2\n- Go to Google Cloud Console\n- Enable Gmail API\n- Create OAuth2 credentials\n- Copy/Paste the Gmail API key to the Gmail node in the n8n workflow\n\n\n\n\n",
