  "description": "# 🎯 Goal\n\nEvery 60 minutes:\n\n- Fetch only “New” leads from a Google Sheet  \n- Send them a personalized email  \n- Update their status to “Contacted” in the same sheet  \n\n## 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n### 1️⃣ 🕒 Trigger: Run Every Day  \n**Node Name:** Schedule Trigger  \n**What it does:** Automatically starts the workflow every 60 minutes (or your chosen interval).  \n**Why it's needed:** You don’t need to run the workflow manually — it runs on a timer, like a robot doing your follow-up.\n\n---\n\n### 2️⃣ 📄 Fetch Leads from Google Sheet  \n**Node Name:** Fetch Leads from Google Sheet  \n**What it does:** Connects to your Google Sheet and pulls all the rows of leads.  \n**Expected columns:**\n\n- Name  \n- Email  \n- Status (should be \"New\" if not yet emailed)  \n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ 🔍 Filter Only New Leads  \n**Node Name:** Filter Only New Leads  \n**What it does:** Filters only rows where `Status = New`.  \n**Why it's needed:** Prevents emailing the same lead twice. Old leads are ignored.\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ 🔁 Batch Process Leads  \n**Node Name:** Batch Process Leads  \n**What it does:** Splits filtered leads into individual batches (usually one-by-one).  \n**Why it's useful:** Helps avoid API rate limits or spam blocks by sending emails one at a time.\n\n---\n\n### 5️⃣ ✉️ Send Email to Lead  \n**Node Name:** Send Email to Lead  \n**What it does:** Sends a personalized email to each lead using their name and email.  \n**How personalization works:** Use variables like `{{ $json[\"Name\"] }}` in the subject/body.\n\n---\n\n### 6️⃣ ✅ Mark Lead as Contacted  \n**Node Name:** Mark Lead as Contacted  \n**What it does:** Updates the row in Google Sheet, changing Status from `New` to `Contacted`.  \n**Why it's important:** Ensures this lead won't be processed again next time.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Loop Back\n\nAfter updating the lead status, the flow loops back to process the next lead from the batch.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Bonus Touch\n\nThis automation is clean, efficient, and scalable. You can later enhance it by:\n\n- Adding AI to write emails dynamically  \n- Sending follow-up reminders  \n- Tracking performance stats in another sheet  ",
