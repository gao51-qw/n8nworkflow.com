  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the process of capturing and storing incoming email details in a structured spreadsheet format, such as Google Sheets or Excel. Whenever a new email is received, the workflow extracts key details—including the sender’s email, subject, email body, and optional attachments—and logs them as a new row in the spreadsheet.\n\nYou can customise this workflow to extract additional details, filter emails based on specific criteria, or send notifications when new entries are added.\n\n## Pre-conditions & Requirements\n\nBefore setting up this workflow, ensure that:\n\n- You have access to the email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, or IMAP-supported email services).\n- The Gmail Node must be enabled in n8n.\n- You must authenticate n8n with Google OAuth2 to access your inbox.\n- Ensure that the Gmail API is enabled in the Google Cloud Console.\n- You have an existing Google Sheet where data will be stored.\n- The Google Sheets API is enabled.\n- You authenticate n8n with your Google account.\n\n## Steps\n\n### Step 1: Add the Gmail Trigger Node\n\n- Click on \"Add Node\" and search for \"Gmail\".\n- Select \"Gmail Trigger\" and click to add it.\n- Under Authentication, click \"Create New\" and authenticate with your Google account.
