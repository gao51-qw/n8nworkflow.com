## How it works
Automatically monitors NIST's CVE database every hour for new vulnerabilities and uses AI to assess their relevance for bug bounty hunting, delivering actionable intelligence directly to Slack.

## Set up steps
- Get Google Gemini API key from AI Studio (free tier available)
- Create Slack bot with chat:write permissions  
- Configure your target Slack channel
- AI filters and scores each CVE for exploitation potential

## What you'll get
Real-time CVE intelligence with:
- Bug bounty relevance scoring (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/NONE)
- Actionable testing strategies for each vulnerability
- Slack-formatted reports with CVSS severity scores
- Focus on web-testable vulnerabilities only

Part of "The Warden" project - perfect for security researchers who want AI-filtered, actionable CVE intelligence without the noise.
