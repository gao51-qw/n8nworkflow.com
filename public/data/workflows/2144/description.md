## Use case
This workflow automatically turns any RSS feed into a newsletter. It send an email every time a new post is published to an RSS feed in the last hour. 
I have been using this personally to follow Derek Sivers and Anil Dash, who don't have newsletters. Check them out 😉

## How to setup
1. Add your email and email creds
2. Add the RSS feed URLs you want to follow

## How to adjust this template
Add the feeds you want to follow. It does not have to be just email. Why not get a telegram message? Or Slack message? Ah the power of n8n 🚀
