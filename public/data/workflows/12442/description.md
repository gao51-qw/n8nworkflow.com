This workflow automates brand intelligence analysis across AI-powered search results by combining **SE Ranking’s AI Search data** with structured processing in n8n.

It retrieves real AI-generated prompts, answers, and cited sources where a brand appears, then normalizes and consolidates this data into a clean, structured format. The workflow eliminates manual review of AI SERPs and makes it easy to understand how AI search engines describe, reference, and position a brand.

## Who this is for

This workflow is designed for:

* **SEO strategists and growth marketers** analyzing brand visibility in AI-powered search engines

* **Product and brand managers** monitoring AI-driven brand perception


## What problem is this workflow solving?
