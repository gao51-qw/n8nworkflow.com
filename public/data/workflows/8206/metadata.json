  "description": "## Overview\n\nWhen designing user interfaces, toolbar icons often get overlooked, even though their placement and grouping dramatically impact usability and user flow. This workflow leverages **Gemini AI** to automatically analyze UI screens, classify toolbar icons based on **Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)**, and suggest optimal placements.\n\nBy combining AI analysis with structured placement logic, this workflow helps designers build more consistent, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces—without spending hours manually arranging icons.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Features\n\n* **AI Classification**: Uses Gemini AI to analyze screenshots and classify icons into roles like `.primaryAction`, `.navigation`, `.confirmationAction`, and more.\n* **HIG-Based Placement**: Automatically assigns icons to the correct toolbar areas—Leading (Left), Trailing (Right), Center, Bottom, or System-decided.\n* **Usage-Aware Reordering**: Reorders icons based on frequency of use so the most relevant actions appear where users expect them.\n* **JSON Output**: Delivers structured results for seamless integration into design tools or documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Install the Workflow**: Import the workflow into your n8n instance.\n2. **Configure Input**:\n\n   * Upload a **screenshot** of your UI.\n   * Upload a **set of icons** you want to classify and place.\n3. **Set Up Gemini AI Node**:\n\n   * Add your Gemini AI API key in the node’s credentials.\n4. **Run the Workflow**: Submit the inputs and let the AI classify and assign placements.\n5. **Export Results**: Copy the JSON output or connect the workflow to your preferred design/documentation tools.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Form Submission** – Capture screenshot + icons.\n2. **Gemini AI Agent** – Interprets screen context and classifies each icon.\n3. **Placement Logic** – Maps icons to the correct toolbar areas.\n4. **Reordering** – Adjusts order based on relevance and HIG standards.\n5. **Structured Output** – Produces clean JSON for further use.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Customization\n\n* **Change AI Prompts**: Modify the Gemini AI node prompts to reflect your app’s design language.\n* **Adjust Placement Rules**: Update logic to follow custom guidelines beyond Apple HIG.\n* **Integrate with Design Tools**: Send the JSON output directly to tools like Figma, Sketch, or internal systems.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Why This Matters\n\n* **Consistency**: Ensures toolbar designs always follow Apple’s HIG.\n* **Efficiency**: Saves designers hours of manual icon placement.\n* **Scalability**: Works across multiple screens, flows, and apps.\n* **AI-Assisted Design**: Augments designer decisions with structured insights instead of replacing them.\n\n",
