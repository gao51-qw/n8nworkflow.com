## Requirements

## Step 3: Market Analysis Workflow
Our market analysis engine processes Zillow market data to provide strategic insights for each location:

  - Risk evaluation (Low to High scale)
  - Actionable investment strategies based on current conditions

This analysis is transformed into actionable advice that directs your negotiation approach and helps you calibrate offers appropriately for market conditions.

## Step 4: Calculate Investment Metrics

- **Purchase & Financing Analysis**:
  - Purchase price and standard acquisition costs (20% down payment, 3% closing costs)
  - Loan amount and monthly mortgage payment (30-year term)
  - Total initial investment calculation

- **Monthly Expense Projections**:
  - Property tax (2% of property value annually)
  - Insurance (0.5% of property value annually)
  - Maintenance reserves (1% of property value annually)
  - Vacancy allowance (8% of rental income)
  - Total monthly expense calculation

- **Rental Income & Returns**:
  - RentZestimate integration (with 1% rule fallback when unavailable)
  - Monthly and annual cash flow projections
  - Cash-on-cash ROI calculation
  - Break-even timeline analysis

- **Investment Quality Filtering**:
  - Automatic filtering to show only positive cash flow properties
  - Property identification with complete details (address, beds, baths, sqft)
  - Full investment metrics breakdown for investor decision-making

This calculator ensures you focus only on properties with profit potential, saving you countless hours of manual analysis.

## Step 5: Generate Communication Templates
- Create templates that combine:
  - Property details (address, price, features)
  - Market intelligence from your analysis
  - Investment metrics showing the property's potential
- Configures your templates to include:
  - A professional introduction
  - Reference to the specific property address
  - Mention of the price reduction
  - A strategic cash offer (typically 5-15% below asking)
  - Local market statistics to build credibility
  - A clear call to action (request to visit the property)

## Step 6: Automated Workflow
- Set up the complete n8n workflow to:
  - Check for new listings with price reductions daily
  - Run market analysis on each new property
  - Calculate potential investment returns
  - Generate personalized communication templates
  - Upload data to Airtable
  - Flag properties ready for contact
  - Update status to "Contacted" after outreach

## Troubleshooting
- If outreach isn't being tracked: Check API connections to Airtable
- If market data seems incorrect: Verify Zillow API parameters and location settings
- If offers are too low/high: Adjust your calculation parameters
