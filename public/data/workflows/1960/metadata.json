  "description": "The workflow first populates a Pinecone index with vectors from a Bitcoin whitepaper. Then, it waits for a manual chat message. When received, the chat message is turned into a vector and compared to the vectors in Pinecone. The most similar vectors are retrieved and passed to OpenAI for generating a chat response.\n\nNote that to use this template, you need to be on n8n version 1.19.4 or later.",
