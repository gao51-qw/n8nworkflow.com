This template scrapes public reviews from **Trustpilot** and **Sitejabber** with a Decodo tool, converts findings into a **flat, spreadsheet-ready JSON**, generates a concise sentiment summary with **Gemini**, and appends everything to **Google Sheets**. It’s ideal for reputation snapshots, competitive analysis, or lightweight BI pipelines that need structured data and a quick narrative.

## Who’s it for?
Marketing teams, growth analysts, founders, and agencies who need repeatable review collection and sentiment summaries without writing custom scrapers or manual copy/paste.

## How it works
1. A **Form Trigger** collects the *Business Name or URL*.
2. **Set (Config Variables)** stores `business_name`, `spreadsheet_id`, and `sheet_id`.
3. The **Agent** orchestrates the Decodo tool and enforces a **strict JSON schema** with at most **10 reviews per source**.
4. **Gemini** writes a succinct summary and recommendations, noting missing sources with: “There’s no data in this website.”
5. A **Merge** node combines JSON fields with the narrative.
6. **Google Sheets** appends a row.

## How to set up
1. Add **Google Sheets**, **Gemini**, and **Decodo** credentials in Credential Manager.
2. Replace `(YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID)` and `(YOUR_SHEET_ID)` in **Set: Config Variables**.
3. In **Google Sheets**, select **Define below** and map each column explicitly.
4. Keep the parser and agent connections intact to guarantee flat JSON.
5. Activate, open the form URL, submit a business, and verify the appended row.
