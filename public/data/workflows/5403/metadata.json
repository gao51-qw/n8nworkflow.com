  "description": "## Build an MCP Server which has access to a semantic database to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\n## Tutorial\n![thumbnail.png](fileId:1878)\n[Click here to watch the full tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/GB2RZ25HTD8)\n\n## How it works\nThis MCP Server has access to a local semantic database (Qdrant) and answers questions being asked to the MCP Client.\n\n## AI Agent Template\n[Click here to navigate to the AI Agent n8n workflow which uses this MCP server](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/5398-ai-assistant-which-answers-questions-with-a-rag-mcp-and-a-search-engine-mcp)\n\n## Warning\nThis flow only runs local and cannot be executed on the n8n cloud platform because of the MCP Client Community Node.\n\n## Installation\n1. Install n8n + Ollama + Qdrant using the [Self-hosted AI starter kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit)\n\n2. Make sure to install Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large as embeddings model.\n\n3. Activate the n8n flow\n\n![activate n8n flow.png](fileId:1593)\n\n4. Run the \"RAG Ingestion Pipeline\" and upload some PDF documents\n\n## How to use it\n1. Run the MCP Client workflow and ask a question. It will be either answered by using the semantic database or the search engine API.\n\n## More detailed instructions\nMissed a step?
