### Who is this for?

If you're overwhelmed with emails and constantly repeating yourself in replies, this workflow is for you.

Whether you're a freelancer, business owner, or team lead, it saves you time by handling email triage and drafting replies for you.

### What does it solve?

This workflow reads your unread Gmail messages and uses AI to:

- Decide whether the email needs a response
- Automatically draft a short, polite reply when appropriate
- Skip spam, newsletters, or irrelevant emails
- Save the AI-generated reply as a Gmail draft (you can edit it before sending)

It takes email fatigue off your plate and keeps your inbox moving.

### How it works

1. **Trigger on New Email**: Watches your Gmail inbox for unread messages.
2. **AI Agent Review**: Analyzes the content to decide if a reply is needed.
3. **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Drafts a short, polite reply (under 120 words).
4. **Create Gmail Draft**: Saves the response as a draft for you to review.
5. **Label It**: Applies a custom label like `Action` so you can easily find AI-handled emails.

### How to set up?

1. **Connect credentials**:
   - Gmail (OAuth2)
   - OpenAI (API key)

2. **Create the Gmail label**:
   - In your Gmail, create a label named `Action` (case-sensitive).

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- **Change the AI prompt**: Add company tone, extra context, or different reply rules.
- **Label more intelligently**: Add conditions or labels for “Newsletter,” “Meeting,” etc.
- **Adjust frequency**: Change how often the Gmail Trigger polls your inbox.
- **Add manual review**: Route drafts to a team member before sending.
