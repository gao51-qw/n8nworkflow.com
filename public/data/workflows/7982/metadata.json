  "description": "**Stop copy-pasting invoice details!**\n\nThis gentle workflow turns a simple **Tally form** into a beautiful **PDF invoice** and delivers it to your client before you finish your latte ☕.**\n\n**Perfect for Etsy sellers, coaches, freelancers and side-hustlers who want soft-tech automation that feels like magic, not middleware.**\n\n**How it works**\n\n1️⃣ You (or your VA) fill a 4-question Tally form: client name, email, amount, due date.\n\n2️⃣ n8n instantly merges the data into a Google Docs template you pre-design (logo, colours, your vibe).\n\n3️⃣ PDF is generated & emailed with a warm, on-brand note.\n\n4️⃣ Optional: same PDF is auto-saved to a “2024-Invoices” Google Drive folder for painless bookkeeping 📁.\n\nZero code, zero Zapier, zero monthly fees—just pure calm productivity.\n\n**Bonus:** template includes placeholder variables so you can add discount lines, PO numbers or custom thank-you messages in seconds.\n\n**Grab it, swap in your own Tally & Gmail credentials, and watch your invoicing shrink from 15 minutes to 15 seconds. Your future self (and your accountant) will send you heart emojis 💌.**\n\n🗂️ **Tally form schema (share with buyers)**\n\nQuestion 1: Client Name (Short text)\n\nQuestion 2: Client Email (Email)\n\nQuestion 3: Amount (Number)\n\nQuestion 4: Due Date (Date)\n\nQuestion 5: Invoice Number (Short text, auto-increment or manual)\n\n**Webhook URL: copy from the “📝 Tally Webhook” node after import.**\n",
