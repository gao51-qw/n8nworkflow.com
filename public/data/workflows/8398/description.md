Nova AI Content Marketing Agent - LinkedIn & Facebook Automation
This n8n template demonstrates how to create a complete AI-powered social media content creation and scheduling system that generates platform-optimized posts for LinkedIn and Facebook with custom images and human approval workflows.
Possible use cases:

Generate a full week of social media content from a single brand brief
Create platform-specific content that maintains brand voice consistency
Automate image generation with AI while maintaining quality control
Schedule approved content across multiple social platforms
Track and organize all content in centralized spreadsheets

How it works

The automation starts with a form submission collecting 10 brand variables (name, industry, demographics, etc.)
Nova AI Agent analyzes the brand information and generates 6 distinct social media posts (3 LinkedIn professional, 3 Facebook community-focused)
Content is split by platform and routed to separate image generation workflows
Google Imagen 4 Ultra creates custom visuals for each post with platform-specific aspect ratios
Each generated image is sent to Slack for human approval via interactive forms
If feedback is provided, NanoBanana AI edits the image based on natural language instructions
Approved images are uploaded to Google Drive with organized naming conventions
All content data is logged to Google Sheets with image URLs and scheduling information
Final posts are scheduled via Late API to respective social platforms
The workflow loops through each post individually for quality control

Replicate API key for Google Imagen 4 Ultra and NanoBanana
