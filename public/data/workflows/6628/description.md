# How it works

This workflow automatically extracts data from invoice documents (PDFs and images) and processes them through a comprehensive validation and approval system.

## Key Steps

1. **Multi-Input Triggers** - Accepts invoices via email attachments or direct file uploads through webhook.
2. **AI-Powered Extraction** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract structured data from invoice documents.
3. **Data Cleaning & Validation** - Processes and validates extracted data against business rules.
4. **Approval Workflow** - Routes invoices requiring approval through a multi-stage approval process.
5. **System Integration** - Automatically sends validated invoices to your accounting system.

## Set up steps

1. **Configure ScrapeGraphAI credentials** - Add your ScrapeGraphAI API key for invoice data extraction.
2. **Set up Telegram connection** - Connect your Telegram account for approval notifications.
3. **Configure email trigger** - Set up IMAP connection for processing emailed invoices.
4. **Customize validation rules** - Adjust business rules, amount thresholds, and vendor lists.
