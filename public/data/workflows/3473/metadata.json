Trigger specific agents with @mentions or let them all respond. Easily scalable by editing simple JSON settings.\n\n### Overview\n\nThis workflow is for users who want to experiment with or utilize multiple AI agents with distinct personalities, instructions, and underlying models within a single chat interface, without complex setup. It solves the problem of managing and interacting with diverse AI assistants simultaneously for tasks like brainstorming, comparative analysis, or role-playing scenarios.\n\nIt enables dynamic conversations with multiple AI assistants simultaneously within a single chat interface. You can:\n\n* Define multiple unique AI agents.\n* Configure each agent with its own name, system instructions, and LLM model (via OpenRouter).\n* Interact with specific agents using `@AgentName` mentions.\n* Have all agents respond (in random order) if no specific agents are mentioned.\n* Maintain conversation history across multiple turns.\n\nIt's designed for flexibility and scalability, allowing you to easily add or modify agents without complex workflow restructuring.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Multi-Agent Interaction:** Chat with several distinct AI personalities at once.\n* **Individual Agent Configuration:** Customize name, system prompt, and LLM for each agent.\n* **OpenRouter Integration:** Access a wide variety of LLMs compatible with OpenRouter.\n* **Mention-Based Triggering:** Direct messages to specific agents using `@AgentName`.\n* **All-Agent Fallback:** Engages all defined agents randomly if no mentions are used.\n* **Scalable Setup:** Agent configuration is centralized in a single Code node (as JSON).\n* **Conversation Memory:** Remembers previous interactions within the session.\n\n### How to Set Up\n\n1.  **Configure Settings (Code Nodes):**\n    * Open the `Define Global Settings` Code node: Edit the JSON to set user details (name, location, notes) and add any system message instructions that *all* agents should follow.\n    * Open the `Define Agent Settings` Code node: Edit the JSON to define your agents. Add or remove agent objects as needed. For each agent, specify:\n        * `\"name\"`: The unique name for the agent (used for @mentions).\n        * `\"model\"`: The OpenRouter model identifier (e.g., `\"openai/gpt-4o\"`, `\"anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet\"`).\n        * `\"systemMessage\"`: Specific instructions or persona for *this* agent.\n2.  **Add OpenRouter Credentials:**\n    * Locate the `AI Agent` node.\n    * Click the `OpenRouter Chat Model` node connected below it via the `Language Model` input.\n    * In the 'Credential for OpenRouter API' field, select or create your OpenRouter API credentials.\n\n### How to Use\n\n1.  Start a conversation using the Chat Trigger input.\n2.  To address specific agents, include `@AgentName` in your message. Agents will respond sequentially in the order they are mentioned.\n    * *Example:* `\"@Gemma @Claude, please continue the count: 1\"` will trigger Gemma first, followed by Claude.\n3.  If your message contains no `@mentions`, *all* agents defined in `Define Agent Settings` will respond in a randomized order.\n    * *Example:* `\"What are your thoughts on the future of AI?\"` will trigger Chad, Claude, and Gemma (based on your default settings) in a random sequence.\n4.  The workflow will collect responses from all triggered agents and return them as a single, formatted message.\n\n### How It Works (Technical Details)\n\n1.  **Settings Nodes:** `Define Global Settings` and `Define Agent Settings` load your configurations.\n2.  **Mention Extraction:** The `Extract mentions` Code node parses the user's input (`chatInput`) from the `When chat message received` trigger. It looks for `@AgentName` patterns matching the names defined in `Define Agent Settings`.\n3.  **Agent Selection:**\n    * If mentions are found, it creates a list of the corresponding agent configurations in the order they were mentioned.\n    * If no mentions are found, it creates a list of *all* defined agent configurations and shuffles them randomly.\n4.  **Looping:** The `Loop Over Items` node iterates through the selected agent list.\n5.  **Dynamic Agent Execution:** Inside the loop:\n    * An `If` node (`First loop?`) checks if it's the first agent responding. If yes (`true` path -&gt; `Set user message as input`), it passes the original user message to the Agent. If no (`false` path -&gt; `Set last Assistant message as input`), it passes the *previous* agent's formatted output (`lastAssistantMessage`) to the *next* agent, creating a sequential chain.\n    * The `AI Agent` node receives the input message. Its `System Message` and the `Model` in the connected `OpenRouter Chat Model` node are dynamically populated using expressions referencing the current agent's data from the loop (`{{ $('Loop Over Items').item.json.* }}`).\n    * The `Simple Memory` node provides conversation history to the `AI Agent`.\n    * The agent's response is formatted (e.g., `**AgentName**:\\n\\nResponse`) in the `Set lastAssistantMessage` node.\n6.  **Response Aggregation:** After the loop finishes, the `Combine and format responses` Code node gathers all the `lastAssistantMessage` outputs and joins them into a single text block, separated by horizontal rules (`---`), ready to be sent back to the user.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* **Scalability & Flexibility:** Instead of complex branching logic, adding, removing, or modifying agents only requires editing simple JSON in the `Define Agent Settings` node, making setup and maintenance significantly easier, especially for those managing multiple assistants.\n* **Model Choice:** Use the best model for each agent's specific task or persona via OpenRouter.\n* **Centralized Configuration:** Keeps agent setup tidy and manageable.\n\n### Limitations\n\n* **Sequential Responses:** Agents respond one after another based on mention order (or randomly), not in parallel.\n* **No Direct Agent-to-Agent Interaction (within a turn):** Agents cannot directly call or reply to each other *during* the processing of a single user message. Agent B sees Agent A's response only because the workflow passes it as input in the next loop iteration.\n* **Delayed Output:** The user receives the combined response only *after* all triggered agents have completed their generation.",
