  "description": "## Google Search Console – Discover New Keywords (Last 7 Days)\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to identify **new queries in Google Search Console** that had no impressions in the past but appeared for the first time in the last 7 days.  \nIt also segments them into two groups: queries with impressions but no clicks yet (**Zero Click**) and queries that already have clicks (**Has Click**).\n\nUse cases include:\n- Finding **emerging SEO opportunities**.  \n- Identifying keywords where you already get impressions but need to optimize for clicks.  \n- Tracking newly discovered queries week over week.  \n\n---\n\n## Good to know\n- This workflow requires a connected **Google Search Console account**.  \n- You can adjust the date ranges in the **Compare search analytics** node to suit your needs.  \n- Works best when scheduled weekly, but in this template we start with **manual execution** for flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n1. **Manual Start** – Run the workflow manually to fetch fresh data.  \n2. **Compare Search Analytics** – Compares the last 7 days against a custom reference period in Google Search Console.  \n3. **Filter (No Past Impressions)** – Keeps only queries that had zero impressions in the reference period.  \n4. **Zero Click** – Filters queries with impressions but no clicks.  \n5. **Has Click** – Filters queries with impressions and clicks.  \n\nThe final output is two clean data sets:\n- **Zero Click queries**: impressions but no clicks → improve meta descriptions, titles, or content relevance.  \n- **Has Click queries**: new queries already generating clicks → consider creating supporting content and optimizing further.  \n\n---\n\n## How to use\n- Start with the **Manual Start node**.  \n- Add your Google Search Console credentials in the **Compare search analytics** node.  \n- Optionally, replace the Manual Start with a **Schedule Trigger** (e.g., weekly) to automate monitoring.  \n- Export results or connect them to Slack, Email, or Google Sheets for reporting.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- **Google Search Console account** (with property access).  \n- n8n instance with the Google Search Console integration enabled.  \n\n---\n\n## Customising this workflow\n- Adjust the **date ranges** in the compare node (e.g., last 30 days vs. previous 30 days).  \n- Replace the output branches with integrations like **Slack, Notion, or Google Sheets** to automatically deliver keyword reports.  \n- Extend the workflow with additional filters, such as filtering by CTR, country, or device.
