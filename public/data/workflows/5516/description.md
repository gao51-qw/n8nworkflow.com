- How it works:
This bot operates in a continuous WhatsApp monitoring loop. It analyzes messages to detect keywords in common questions (like hours, prices, and location) and sends automatic replies with predefined information. For unrecognized questions, it directs the user to manual assistance.

- Set up steps:
The initial setup involves integrating with the WhatsApp API, registering keywords and their respective responses, and defining the fallback flow. It takes only a few minutes to have the bot running with essential information.
