## What It Does

## Prerequisites
- **QuickBooks Online Credential**: Set up your QuickBooks Online connection in n8n for expense creation.
- **Google Sheets Credential**: Set up your Google Sheets connection in n8n to read and write data.

## How It Works
1. **Refresh Google Sheets Data**: The workflow will first refresh the list of vendors and chart of accounts from your Google Sheets template.
2. **Import Bank Transactions**: Open the provided Google Sheets template and copy-paste your transactions from your online banking CSV file.
3. **Categorize Transactions**: Quickly categorize the transactions in Google Sheets, or assign this task to a team member.
4. **Run the Workflow**: Once the transactions are categorized, run the workflow again, and each expense will be created automatically in QuickBooks Online.

## Setup Instructions

   - In n8n, connect your Google Sheets and QuickBooks accounts. Follow the credential setup instructions for both services.

   - Link the specific Google Sheet that contains your expense data. Make sure the sheet includes the correct columns for transactions, vendors, and accounts.

3. **Setup the QuickBooks Node**:  
   - Configure the QuickBooks Online node to create expense entries in QuickBooks from the data in your Google Sheets.

4. **Setup the HTTP Node for API Calls**:

## How to Use
1. **Import Transactions**:  
   - Copy and paste your bank transactions from the CSV into the provided Google Sheets template.

2. **Categorize Transactions**:  
   - Manually categorize the transactions in the sheet, or delegate this task to another person to ensure they’re correctly tagged (e.g., Utilities, Office Supplies, Travel).

3. **Run the Workflow**:  
   - Execute the workflow to automatically upload the categorized expenses into QuickBooks.

4. **Verify in QuickBooks**:
