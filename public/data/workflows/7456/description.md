## How it works

This workflow automates your initial hiring pipeline by creating an AI-powered CV scanner. It collects job applications through a web form, uses AI to analyze the candidate's CV against your job description, and neatly organizes the results in a Google Sheet.

Here’s the step-by-step process:
*   **The Application Form:** A `Form Trigger` provides a public web form for candidates to submit their name, email, and CV (as a PDF).
*   **Initial Logging:** As soon as an application is submitted, the candidate's name and email are added to a Google Sheet. This ensures every applicant is logged, even if a later step fails.
*   **CV Text Extraction:** The workflow uses **Mistral's OCR** model to accurately extract all the text from the uploaded CV PDF.
*   **AI Analysis:** The extracted text is sent to **Google Gemini**. A detailed prompt instructs the AI to act as a hiring assistant, scoring the CV against the specific requirements of your job role and providing a detailed explanation for its score.
*   **Structured Output:** A `JSON Output Parser` ensures the AI's analysis is returned in a clean, structured format, making the data reliable.
*   **Final Record:** The AI-generated qualification score and explanation are added to the candidate's row in the Google Sheet, giving you a complete, analyzed list of applicants.
