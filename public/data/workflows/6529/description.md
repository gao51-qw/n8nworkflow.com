## 🧩 What Problem Does It Solve?
Meta’s ad forms often generate unqualified leads from casual scrollers. This workflow uses WhatsApp and AI to automatically verify, qualify, and prioritize real leads — saving time and boosting sales efficiency.

# 📝 Description
This workflow automates lead qualification for businesses using Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram Lead Ads) to filter out irrelevant leads. It ensures only confirmed prospects enter your CRM by:

Collecting new Facebook leads

Verifying via WhatsApp confirmation

Classifying responses with AI

Updating CRM status based on intent

When a new Facebook lead arrives:

Lead details are extracted (name/phone/email)

Zoho CRM is checked for existing contacts

WhatsApp confirmation request is sent

AI classifies the response (confirmed/declined/human/invalid)

CRM status is updated automatically

Sales team receives only verified leads
## 🎯 Key Advantages for Meta Ads
✅ Blocks 60%+ irrelevant leads based on WhatsApp non-response
✅ Reduces fake submissions by requiring active confirmation
✅ Prevents CRM bloat through duplicate checking
✅ Identifies hot leads via instant "human_requested" escalation
