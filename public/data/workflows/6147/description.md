## Who’s it for
This template is perfect for freelancers, small business owners, or financial assistants who want to record and approve financial transactions like income and expenses directly from Telegram, without opening a spreadsheet manually.

It’s also useful for teams that require a supervisor to approve expenses before they’re finalized.


## What it does
This workflow allows users to:

- Start a conversation via Telegram using the /start command.
- Choose to record an income or expense.
- Submit transaction data using a structured format.
- Store the data into Google Sheets in real time.
- For expenses, automatically notify a supervisor for approval.
- The supervisor can Approve ✅, Reject ❌, or View Details 👁.
- Sends feedback to the user based on supervisor action.


## 🔧 How it works

1. Telegram Bot Trigger: Captures user input via message or inline button callback.
2. Message Detection Logic: Differentiates between text input and button interactions.
3. Switch Node: Routes the message type:
   - /start: Displays income/expense buttons.
   - Input text: Validates formatting and parses data.
   - Callback: Handles approval/rejection process.

4. Google Sheets Integration: Appends or updates entries in different sheets based on the data type.

5. Notifications:

   - User gets feedback (recorded, pending, approved, rejected).
   - Supervisor receives inline button options for approval.


## Google Sheets Details
You will need a Google Sheet with the following two worksheets:

Sheet 1: income
Sheet 2: Sheet1 (Default tab for expenses)


## 📱 Telegram Setup Instructions

1. Create a bot using @BotFather.
2. Save the bot token.
3. Go to n8n Credentials → Telegram API and add:
   - Access Token = your bot token
4. In Telegram, send /start to your bot.
5. Make sure your bot has enabled privacy mode (or disabled, if used in a group).


💡 For the approval flow, update the node Send Approval Request with the correct chatId of the supervisor's Telegram account. You can hardcode a static ID (e.g., "123456789") or pull from a variable if dynamic.
