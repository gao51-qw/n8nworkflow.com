  "description": "# Social Media Spark (SMS) — Automated Viral Content Engine\n\nAutomate your entire **content workflow**: discover viral ideas, generate posts in your tone, repurpose for X, and auto-publish — reducing **90% of manual effort**.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 What it Does\n- Scrapes competitors or niche profiles on LinkedIn to find **high-performing posts**.\n- Classifies and saves **evergreen content ideas** for later use.\n- Generates **fresh posts** in your own voice with **matching images**.\n- Repurposes content for **X (Twitter)** in a platform-optimized style.\n- Automatically **publishes content** to LinkedIn and X on your schedule.\n- Allows **on-demand commands** via Telegram for research or instant content generation.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Why Use It\n- **Save time:** no more manual scraping, idea collection, or formatting.\n- **Stay consistent:** maintain a daily content pipeline.\n- **Multi-platform leverage:** create once, adapt for LinkedIn and X.\n- **Creative control:** mix automation with optional human review.\n- **Scalable:** extend to more platforms, analytics, and workflows as you grow.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Prerequisites & Setup\nBefore importing or activating the workflow, prepare these:\n\n- **AI Provider (OpenAI / Gemini / OpenRouter)**  \n  For classifying posts, generating new content, repurposing for X.\n\n- **Google Sheets**  \n  Central database for competitors, ideas, generated posts, and posting status.\n\n- **Google Drive**  \n  Stores generated images.\n\n- **Apify & Browseract**  \n  Scrapes LinkedIn profiles, posts, and performs research tasks.\n\n- **LinkedIn API**  \n  Needed for automated LinkedIn publishing.\n\n- **X (Twitter) API**  \n  Requires **OAuth 1.0a** for image uploads and **OAuth 2.0** for text posting.\n\n- **Telegram Bot**  \n  Enables on-demand commands and notifications.  \n  Set your Telegram User ID in the trigger node.\n\n&gt; 🔎 In each sub-workflow, look for nodes marked **“Configure Me!”** to replace example prompts, search keywords, sheet IDs, etc.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified Flow)\n1. **Scrape & Classify:** Collect high-engagement posts → keep evergreen ones.  \n2. **Generate Content:** Rewrite ideas into new posts in your voice → create images.  \n3. **Repurpose for X:** Adapt LinkedIn posts for short-form, high-impact tweets.  \n4. **Auto-Publish:** Post daily on LinkedIn and X.  \n5. **Control via Telegram:** Manually trigger scraping, research, or post generation.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Best Practices & Tips\n- Keep all **API keys private** — never share them in public repos or screenshots.\n- Adjust **cron schedules** (e.g., scraping on weekends, posting on weekdays) to fit your content rhythm.\n- Add **Human-in-the-Loop** review steps for brand-sensitive content.\n- Extend to other platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts) as needed.\n- Experiment with **prompt variations** for different tones or creative styles.\n- Add **analytics logging** (likes, comments, clicks) to measure content performance.\n\n---\n\n## 🙋‍♂️ Who is This For\n- **Solo creators & founders** who want to post consistently but don’t have time for daily ideation.\n- **Small marketing teams** that need to keep up with trends without spending hours on research.\n- **Consultants & thought leaders** who want to amplify their personal brand on LinkedIn and X.\n- **Startups & bootstrapped businesses** that need a lean but reliable content engine.\n- **Content strategists** who want a data-driven, repeatable pipeline for finding and using what works.\n\nOr anyone who wants to boost social presence by 300%\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Why SMS Stands Out\n- **Authentic voice:** Uses your own tone and style (defined in prompts and examples), so posts feel personal — not generic AI fluff.\n- **Data-driven:** Pulls from real, viral posts in your niche to inspire fresh content.\n- **Quality over quantity:** Focuses only on proven viral ideas instead of churning random posts.\n- **Consistent growth:** Keeps your posting regular, so you stay visible and relevant.\n- **Efficient workflow:** Minimizes manual work while letting you step in when needed (e.g., for approvals or special campaigns).\n\n&gt; ⚡ SMS combines **real market data** with your **unique voice** — so you post smarter, not just more often.\n",
