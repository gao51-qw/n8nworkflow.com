  "title": "Automated server log cleanup via email alerts with SSH - Nginx, Docker, System",
  "description": "This n8n workflow monitors email alerts for disk utilization exceeding 80%, extracts the server IP, logs into the server, and purges logs from Nginx, PM2, Docker, and system files to clear disk space.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n- Ensure email alerts are consistently formatted with server IP details.  \n- SSH access must be properly configured to avoid authentication failures.\n\n### Workflow Process\n\n1. Initiate the workflow with the `Check Disk Alert Emails` node when an email triggers on high disk usage.  \n2. Parse the email to extract the server IP using the `Extract Server IP from Email` node.  \n3. Set up SSH credentials and paths manually with the `Prepare SSH Variables` node.  \n4. Execute cleanup commands to delete logs from Nginx, PM2, Docker, and system files using the `Run LogCleanup Commands via SSH` node.\n\n### Usage Guide\n\n- Import the workflow into n8n and configure email and SSH credentials.  \n- Test with a sample email alert to verify IP extraction and log deletion.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Email service (e.g., IMAP or API) for alert monitoring  \n- SSH access with valid credentials  \n\n### Customization Options\n\nModify the `Prepare SSH Variables` node to target specific log directories or adjust cleanup commands for different server setups.",
