# Instagram Hashtag Lead Generation

Automate the process of finding and qualifying Instagram leads based on hashtags. This workflow reads hashtags from Google Sheets, scrapes Instagram for posts using Apify, analyzes caption content and language, compiles unique usernames, gathers detailed user info, and filters leads based on follower count.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Hashtags**  
   The workflow starts and pulls a list of hashtags from a Google Sheet.

2. **Scrape Instagram Posts**
   For each hashtag, it builds Instagram explore URLs and scrapes posts using Apify.

3. **Analyze Captions**
   Each caption is cleaned, hashtags and links are removed, and language/content is analyzed (English/French/Spanish).

4. **Extract & Filter Usernames**
   Usernames are combined and deduplicated, their Instagram profiles scraped for follower counts and other details.

5. **Qualified Leads**
   Only users with followers in your target range are kept as qualified leads for outreach or analysis.
