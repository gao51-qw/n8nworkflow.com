## Smart Document Parser for Invoices, Logs or Sensor Reports (PDF/Image to Google Sheets)

This n8n workflow automatically parses documents such as invoices, sensor logs or structured PDFs/images (including scanned docs or CSVs), extracts key fields like totals, dates and customer/vendor info using OCR and AI, and writes the structured output into Google Sheets.

## Who’s it for

* Finance or Ops teams automating invoice processing.
* SaaS platforms parsing uploaded reports or documents.
* Anyone needing a no-code backend for PDF/image/CSV document parsing.
* AI-powered data capture pipelines.

## How it works
1. **Webhook Trigger** receives file uploads (`/uploadDoc`)
2. **Switch Node** checks the file type:
	* If **image** → Use **Tesseract OCR**
	* If **PDF** → Use PDF parser
	* If **CSV** → Extract as-is
3. Extracted text is passed to:
	* **Google Gemini or Gemini Flash AI** model
	* Prompt extracts fields like `invoice_id`, `total`, `customer_name`, etc.
4. JSON string is parsed and cleaned
5. Data is appended to **Google Sheets** using `appendOrUpdate`

## How to set up
1. Create a Google Sheet with columns like:

`invoice_id`, `invoice_date`, `due_date`, `customer_name`, `vendor_name`, `subtotal`, `tax_total`, `total`, `currency`

2. Connect:
	* Google Sheets OAuth
	* Google Gemini (PaLM API key) for LLM parsing
3. Deploy the webhook endpoint: `/uploadDoc`
4. Upload sample files (PDFs, images, CSVs) to test
5. Review and map sheet columns in the `Invoice Data` node

## Requirements

| Tool | Purpose |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| n8n | Automation framework |
| Google Sheets | To store structured output |
| Tesseract OCR | For scanned image text extraction |
| Google Gemini | For natural language parsing |

## How to customize

* Add extraction for **line items** using structured prompts.
* Change prompt to extract **sensor readings**, **log types**, or custom keys.
* Add support for other file types (e.g., XLSX, DOCX).
* Add Slack/Email notifications on success/failure.
* Swap Gemini with OpenAI or Hugging Face if preferred.

## Add‑ons

* Save uploaded files to Google Drive or S3
* Add auth for secure uploads
* Use charting/dashboard nodes to visualize extracted data
* Integrate with billing/accounting software

## Use Case Examples

| Scenario | What Happens |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invoice Upload (PDF) | Extracts totals, customer, tax data into a Google Sheet |
| Scanned Receipt (Image) | OCR + LLM extracts structured data |
| Log File (CSV) | Parses and logs entries into Sheets |

## Common troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Webhook not triggered` | URL or method mismatch | Use correct POST URL `/uploadDoc` |
| `Text is blank` | OCR failed | Check image quality or Tesseract config |
| `Gemini model not returning JSON` | Prompt formatting issue | Ensure prompt ends with valid JSON schema |
| `Sheet not updated` | Invalid Sheet ID or tab | Double-check sheet credentials and tab name |
