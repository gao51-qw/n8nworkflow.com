*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically tracks individual sales rep performance—calls, emails, meetings, quota attainment—and surfaces coaching insights. Free your managers from manual report building and focus on improvement.

## Overview
