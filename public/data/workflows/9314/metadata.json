  "description": "## Automated Weekly Newsletter with AI Research, Editorial Drafting, and Approval Flow\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to automate the full production cycle of a professional weekly newsletter. It combines AI-powered market research, editorial drafting, compliance validation, and an approval loop — all before creating a final Gmail draft ready for distribution.\n\nUse cases are many:\n- Wealth managers sending weekly market updates to clients\n- Startups producing recurring research digests\n- Teams creating automated newsletters for marketing or content distribution\n\n### Good to know\n\n- At time of writing, each AI call (research, editorial, QC) consumes API tokens from Perplexity and OpenAI. See provider pricing for updated info.\n- Gmail integration requires OAuth setup with your account.\n- You can adapt the prompts to any domain — from finance to tech to education.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Schedule Trigger runs every week and sets the date window.\n- Research LLM fetches structured JSON market data using Perplexity.\n- Editorial LLM transforms research into a polished ~2,000 word client-ready newsletter.\n- QC LLM validates factual accuracy and compliance risks before approval.\n- Preview Email is sent with Approve/Revise buttons. Clicking opens a secure n8n-hosted approval form.\n- Final Draft Creation: Once approved, the workflow generates a clean Gmail draft, ready to send.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Replace the demo schedule trigger with your own (weekly, daily, or event-based).\n- Set up Gmail OAuth credentials to enable email previews and final drafts.\n- Update branding (logo, disclaimer, signature) in the HTML builder node.\n- Adjust prompts to your audience — e.g., simplify tone for marketing, or keep institutional tone for financial clients.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Perplexity account for research API (or your LLM of choice)\n- OpenAI for editorial and QC steps (or your LLM of choice)\n- Gmail account with OAuth credentials\n- Optional: your own domain to host the approval webhook\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\nThis workflow can be extended beyond financial newsletters. Try:\n- Content marketing: Automate weekly digests or trend reports\n- Education: Generate curriculum summaries with approval loops for teachers\n- Internal comms: Automate compliance-checked company updates",
