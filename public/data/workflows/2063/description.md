This workflow allows to scrape Google Maps data in an efficient way using SerpAPI. 

You'll get all data from Gmaps at a cheaper cost than Google Maps API.

Add as input, your Google Maps search URL and you'll get a list of places with many data points such as:
- phone number
- website
- rating
- reviews
- address

And much more.
