  "description": "### 🤖 Instagram AI Agent with MCP Server – Built for Smart Engagement and Automation\n\n#### Hi! I’m Amanda 🥰\nI build intelligent automations with n8n and Make.  \nThis powerful workflow was designed to help teams automatically handle Instagram interactions with AI. Using **Meta Graph API**, **LangChain**, **MCP Server**, and **GPT-4o**, it allows your AI agent to **search for posts, read captions, fetch comments**, and even **reply or message followers**, all through structured tools.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What the workflow does\n\n- Searches for recent media using Instagram ID and access token  \n- Reads and extracts captions or media URLs  \n- Fetches comments and specific replies from each post  \n- Replies to comments automatically with GPT-generated responses  \n- Sends direct messages to followers who commented  \n- Maps user input and session to keep memory context via LangChain  \n- Communicates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) using your MCP Server URL\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 Nodes & Tech Used\n\n- `LangChain Agent` + `Chat Model` with GPT-4o  \n- `Memory Buffer` for session memory  \n- `toolHttpRequest` to search media, comments, and send replies  \n- `MCP Trigger` and `MCP Tool` (custom SSE connection)  \n- `Set` node for input and variable assignment  \n- `Webhook` and JSON for Instagram API structure\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n1. Create your Instagram App in Meta Developer Portal  \n2. Add your **Instagram ID** and **Access Token** in the `Set` node  \n3. Update the **MCP Server Tool URL** in the `MCP Instagram` node  \n   - Use your n8n server URL (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/mcp/server/instagram/sse`)  \n4. Trigger the workflow using the included `LangChain Chat Trigger`  \n5. Interact via text to ask the agent to:\n   - “Get latest posts”  \n   - “Reply to comment X with this message”  \n   - “Send DM to this user about...”  \n\n---\n\n### 👥 Who this is for\n\n- Social media teams managing multiple comments  \n- Brands automating engagement with followers  \n- Agencies creating smart, autonomous digital assistants  \n- Developers building conversational Instagram bots\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Requirements\n\n- Meta Graph API access  \n- Instagram Business account  \n- n8n instance (Cloud or Self-hosted)  \n- MCP Server configured (SSE Endpoint enabled)  \n- OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4o + LangChain)\n\n---\n\n### 🌐 Want to use this workflow?\n\n❤️ Buy workflows: [https://iloveflows.com](https://iloveflows.com)  \n☁️ Try n8n Cloud: [https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda)",
