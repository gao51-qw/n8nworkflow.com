Reduce human delays between **malware detection and remediation** in MSSP/SOC environments. This workflow automates full endpoint antivirus scanning immediately after high-severity endpoint infection wazuh alerts, closing the gap between alerting and action.

**Why Use This Workflow?**

Malware alerts are only effective if acted upon swiftly. Manual follow-ups are slow or often missed, letting threats persist.

**Automates detection, triage, scan initiation, and notification—all** within **one minute** of alerting.

Ensures consistent, auditable actions across endpoints running Linux or Windows.
