# Create animated baby podcast videos with GPT, DALL-E, ElevenLabs and Hedra

> ## 🚀 Overview

This workflow is your personal content creation studio for social media. It takes a simple idea and a few descriptive words and automatically produces a complete, ready-to-share video of a custom-designed baby hosting their own podcast. It's the ultimate tool for creating unique, funny, and engaging content that captures attention and drives shares.

## 😩 The Problem

Creating animated video content is a massive headache. Manually, you'd have to:
1.  Hire or be a skilled graphic designer to create the character.
2.  Write a clever and engaging script.
3.  Find a voice actor to record the audio.
4.  Use complex and expensive animation software to make the character's mouth and expressions match the audio.
5.  Render and export the final video.

This process is incredibly time-consuming, requires specialized skills, and can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a single short video. The barrier to creating fun, viral content is just too high.

## ✨ The Solution

This workflow acts as your automated video production team! It elegantly handles the entire creation process from start to finish. Here’s how it works:

1.  **🎙️ Design Your Star:** You start by filling out a simple form to design your baby podcaster. You choose their ethnicity, hair style, outfit, and even how chubby their cheeks are. You also give them a topic to discuss.
2.  **✍️ Generate a Script & Image:** Instantly, the automation writes a short podcast script using OpenAI (GPT-4) and generates a unique, photorealistic image of your baby with DALL-E.
3.  **🗣️ Bring it to Life:** It then creates a voice for your baby using the script (via ElevenLabs) and animates the baby's face to talk and express themselves perfectly in sync with the audio (via Hedra).
4.  **📂 Deliver the Final Cut:** The final, ready-to-post video is automatically rendered and saved directly into a designated Google Drive folder. Your viral video is ready to be shared with the world in just a few minutes!

## ⚙️ Simple Setup

This workflow is a pre-built blueprint, designed to be up and running in minutes!
