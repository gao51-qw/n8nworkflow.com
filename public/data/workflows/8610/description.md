**Instantly access live Bybit Spot Market data in Telegram!**

This workflow integrates the **Bybit REST v5 API** with **Telegram** and optional **GPT-4.1-mini formatting**, delivering real-time crypto market insights such as **latest prices, order books, trades, and candlesticks** — all presented in clean, structured Telegram messages.

## 🔎 How It Works

1. A **Telegram Trigger** node listens for incoming user requests.
2. **User Authentication** checks the Telegram ID against an allowlist.
3. A **Session ID** is created from `chat.id` for lightweight memory across interactions.
4. The **Bybit AI Agent** orchestrates multiple API requests via HTTP nodes:

   * **Latest Price & 24h Stats** (`/v5/market/tickers?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT`)
   * **Order Book Depth** (`/v5/market/orderbook?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=50`)
   * **Best Bid/Ask Snapshot** (from order book top levels)
   * **Candlestick Data (Klines)** (`/v5/market/kline?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=15&limit=200`)
   * **Recent Trades** (`/v5/market/recent-trade?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT&limit=100`)
5. **Utility Nodes** process and format the response:

   * **Calculator** → computes spreads, mid-prices, % changes.
   * **Think** → transforms JSON into human-readable reports.
   * **Simple Memory** → stores symbol, sessionId, and previous inputs.
6. **Message Splitter** ensures responses over 4000 characters are broken into chunks.
7. Final results are sent back to **Telegram** in structured, readable format.
