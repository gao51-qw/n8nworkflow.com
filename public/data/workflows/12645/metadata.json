Collects **exactly 3 images** via a form upload  \n2. Validates inputs to ensure all required images are present  \n3. Splits images into individual processing paths  \n4. Uploads original images to Google Drive (permanent storage)  \n5. Generates public, crawlable image URLs  \n6. Analyzes each image using AI vision (GPT-4O)  \n7. Aggregates image descriptions into a structured context  \n8. Generates a professional photoshoot prompt using an AI agent  \n9. Creates a new image via NanoBanana Pro \n10. Polls the API until the image generation is completed  \n11. Downloads the final image as a binary file  \n12. Uploads the final image to Google Drive  \n13. Logs results (images + descriptions) into Google Sheets  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup\n\n### Required credentials\n- Google Drive (OAuth)  \n- Google Sheets (OAuth)  \n- OpenAI API key  \n- AtlasCloud API key  \n\n### Required configuration\n1. Replace all `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__&gt;` fields:\n   - Google Drive folder IDs  \n   - Google Sheets document ID and sheet name  \n   - AtlasCloud API key  \n2. Ensure Google Drive folders have write permissions  \n3. Confirm tmpfiles.org is reachable from your environment  \n\n### Important notes\n- The workflow expects **exactly 3 images**\n- The final image is downloaded as binary before upload\n- Public URLs are normalized to `https://tmpfiles.org/dl/...` for maximum AI compatibility\n\n### 🎥 [Watch This Tutorial](https://youtu.be/EVIvyyoNrQE)\n\n![SORA2 logo](https://www.dr-firas.com/scalle-e.png)\n\n---\n### 👋 Need help or want to customize this?\n📩 Contact: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/)  \n📺 YouTube: [@DRFIRASS](https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)  \n🚀 Workshops: [Mes Ateliers n8n](https://hotm.art/formation-n8n)\n\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCriIQI8uaoEro5FEnOpeidQ) / [🚀 Mes Ateliers n8n  ](https://hotm.art/formation-n8n)",
