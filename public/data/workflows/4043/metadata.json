  "description": "**Description**\nThis workflow automatically classifies user queries and retrieves the most relevant information based on the query type. 🌟 It uses adaptive strategies like;\n   Factual, Analytical, Opinion, and Contextual to deliver more precise and meaningful responses by leveraging n8n's flexibility. Integrated with Qdrant vector store and Google Gemini, it processes each query faster and more effectively. 🚀\n\n**How It Works?**\nQuery Reception: A user query is triggered (e.g., through a chatbot interface). 💬\n\n*Classification*: The query is classified into one of four categories:\n\n*Factual*: Queries seeking verifiable information.\n\n*Analytical*: Queries that require in-depth analysis or explanation.\n\n*Opinion*: Queries looking for different perspectives or subjective viewpoints.\n\n*Contextual*: Queries specific to the user or certain contextual conditions.\n\n*Adaptive Strategy Application*: Based on classification, the query is restructured using the relevant strategy for better results.\n\nResponse Generation**: The most relevant documents and context are used to generate a tailored response. 🎯\n\n**Set Up Steps**\n\nEstimated Time: ⏳ 10-15 minutes\nPrerequisites: You need an n8n account and a Qdrant vector store connection.\nSteps:\n\nImport the n8n workflow: Load the workflow into your n8n instance.\n\nConnect Google Gemini and Qdrant: Link these tools for query processing and data retrieval.\n\nConnect the Trigger Interface: Integrate with a chatbot or API to trigger the workflow.\n\nCustomize: Adjust settings based on the query types you want to handle and the output format. 🔧\n\n**For more detailed instructions, please check the sticky notes inside the workflow. 📌**",
