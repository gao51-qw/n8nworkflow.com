# Generate AI Voiceovers from Scripts and Upload to Google Drive

This is the final piece of the AI content factory. This workflow takes your text-based video scripts and automatically generates high-quality audio voiceovers for each one, turning your text into ready-to-use audio assets for your video ads.

Go from a spreadsheet of text to a folder of audio files, completely on autopilot.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Read First!)
This is an advanced, self-hosted workflow that requires specific local setup:

*   **Self-Hosted n8n Only:** This workflow uses the `Execute Command` and `Read/Write Files` nodes, which requires you to run your own instance of n8n. It will not work on n8n Cloud.
*   **FFmpeg Installation:** You must have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on the same machine where your n8n instance is running. This is used to convert the audio files to a standard format.

## What it does
This is Part 3 of the AI marketing series. It connects to the Google Sheet where you generated your video scripts (in Part 2). For each script that hasn't been processed, it:

1.  Uses the Google Gemini Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to generate a voiceover.
2.  Saves the audio file to your local computer.
3.  Uses FFmpeg to convert the raw audio into a standard `.wav` file.
4.  Uploads the final `.wav` file to your Google Drive.
5.  Updates the original Google Sheet with a link to the audio file in Drive and marks the script as complete.

## How to set up
**IMPORTANT:** This workflow is Part 3 of a series and requires the output from Part 2 ("Generate AI Video Ad Scripts").

**If you need Part 1 or Part 2 of this workflow series, you can find them for free on [my n8n Creator Profile](https://n8n.io/creators/jj-tham/).**

1.  **Connect to Your Scripts Sheet:** In the "Getting Video Scripts" node, connect your Google Sheets account and provide the URL to the sheet containing your generated video scripts from Part 2.
2.  **Configure AI Voice Generation (HTTP Request):**
    *   In the "HTTP Request To Generate Voice" node, go to the **Query Parameters** and replace `INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE` with your Google Gemini API key.
    *   In the **JSON Body**, you can customize the voice prompt (e.g., change `&lt;INSERT YOUR DESIRED ACCENT HERE&gt;`).
3.  **Set Your Local File Path:** In the first "Read/Write Files from Disk" node, update the **File Name** field to a valid directory on your local machine where n8n has permission to write files. Replace `/Users/INSERT_YOUR_LOCAL_STORAGE_HERE/`.
4.  **Connect Google Drive:** In the "Uploading Wav File" node, connect your Google Drive account and choose the folder where your audio files will be saved.
5.  **Update Your Tracking Sheet:** In the final "Uploading Google Drive Link..." node, ensure it's connected to the same Google Sheet from Step 1. This node will update your sheet with the results.

Description:
Welcome to the final piece of the AI content factory! 🔊 This advanced workflow takes the video ad scripts you've generated and automatically creates high-quality audio voiceovers for each one, completing your journey from strategy to ready-to-use media assets.
⚠️ This is an advanced workflow for self-hosted n8n instances only and requires FFmpeg to be installed locally.
## ⚙️ How it works
This workflow is Part 3 of a series. It reads your video scripts from a Google Sheet, then for each script it:
- Generates a voiceover using the Google Gemini TTS API.
- Saves the audio file to your local machine.
- Converts the file to a standard .wav format using FFmpeg.
- Uploads the final audio file to Google Drive.
- Updates your Google Sheet with a link to the new audio file.
## 👥 Who’s it for?
- Video Creators & Marketers: Mass-produce voiceovers for video ads, tutorials, or social media content without hiring voice actors.
- Automation Power Users: A powerful example of how n8n can bridge cloud APIs with local machine commands.
- Agencies: Drastically speed up the production of audio assets for client campaigns.


## 🛠️ How to set up
This workflow requires specific local setup due to its advanced nature.
