### This n8n template demonstrates how to calculate the evaluation metric "Correctness" which in this scenario, measures the compares and classifies the agent's response against a set of ground truths.

The scoring approach is adapted from the open-source evaluations project [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/) and you can see the source here [https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/blob/main/ragas/src/ragas/metrics/_answer_correctness.py](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/blob/main/ragas/src/ragas/metrics/_answer_correctness.py)

### How it works
* This evaluation works best where the agent's response is allowed to be more verbose and conversational.
* For our scoring, we classify the agent's response into 3 buckets: True Positive (in answer and ground truth), False Positive (in answer but not ground truth) and False Negative (not in answer but in ground truth).
* We also calculate an average similarity score on the agent's response against all ground truths.
* The classification and the similarity score is then averaged to give the final score. 
* A high score indicates the agent is accurate whereas a low score could indicate the agent has incorrect training data or is not providing a comprehensive enough answer.
