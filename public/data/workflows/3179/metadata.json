  "description": "\n# 🚀 **Perfect if you are...**\n\n- 💰 **Beginner Investor** – Learn the market faster with AI-powered insights guiding your decisions.\n- 📈 **Retail Trader** – Optimize your trading strategy with in-depth analysis typically reserved for professionals.\n- 🏦 **Hedge Fund & Institutional Trader** – Automate high-level market analysis using advanced AI models.\n- 🤖 **Automation Enthusiast** – Get hands-on with **n8n** and build an automated stock research tool.\n\n---\n\n# ❔ **What It Does:**\n\n✅ **AI-Driven Investment Reports** – Our system analyzes **30,000+ tickers** with historical data spanning **30+ years**. It provides **fundamental, technical, and sentiment analysis** in a structured, easy-to-read report.\n\n✅ **Your Personal Hedge Fund on Your PC** – AI-powered advisors analyze **earnings reports, insider trades, stock prices, financial metrics, and news**, delivering precise, data-driven recommendations tailored to you.\n\n✅ **Real Advisors, Real Insights** – Our system replicates the thought processes of **investing legends** like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Cathie Wood, and Ben Graham, offering multiple expert-style perspectives on every stock decision.\n\n✅ **Ultra Low Cost** – Running this workflow costs **less than $0.30 per report** (*AI model costs not included*). That’s cheaper than a cup of coffee, yet it provides insights worth thousands of dollars.\n\n---\n# 🛠️ **Initial Setup**\n\n- Visit [FinancialDatasets.ai](FinancialDatasets.ai) and retrieve your API key.\n- Locate the **HTTPS Nodes** (🌐) and insert your API key under the header **X-API-KEY** in each one.\n- In the **Gmail node**, ensure you set up the email where you want to receive your reports.\n- Test your workflow by typing the name of a company or the stock ticker in the chat. Your report should arrive within 10 minutes.\n\n---\n\n# 🧪 **Customize It!**\n\n- To modify the **workflow triggers**, change the trigger type and **update the message that the Ticker Extractor receives** in this part of the prompt:  \n  `\"Based on this message, =={{ $json.chatInput }}== \"`  \n  *This prevents any disruptions in the workflow.*\n\n- To **change the report destination**, update the node type. You can send reports to **Telegram, Slack, or other platforms** instead of Gmail.\n\n- Each **advisor's personality** is configured through its system message—feel free to tweak it to suit your needs.\n\n- You can **create new agents** by duplicating an existing one and assigning it a different personality.  \n  **Remember to reference the new agent in the linked nodes** to ensure seamless integration.\n\n\n----\n\n⚠️ **Important Note:**  \nThis workflow requires an **API key from [FinancialDatasets.ai](FinancialDatasets.ai)** to access stock market data.\n",
