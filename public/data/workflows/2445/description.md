### Why should I use this?

Enhance your Meta Ads tracking by taking control of the events you send. This n8n template allows you to:

- **Improve Tracking Quality**: Even if your Facebook Pixel fails, events are still captured through the Meta Conversions API.
- **Send Offline Events**: Record events that happen offline, like personal sales or in-store purchases.
- **Integrate with Your CRM**: Automatically send events to Facebook when a lead converts after a sales call, updating customer details so Meta knows about the conversion.
- **Use Advanced Tracking**: Tracking has become harder in recent years, making campaigns more expensive. By using Advanced Tracking, you help Facebook track events more easily, reducing campaign costs and improving the results.
