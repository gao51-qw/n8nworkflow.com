## contract
* input: length of the strings and number of copies
* output: random strings as specified.
  * randomness determined by Crypto node (generate/base64)

## How to run the workflow
1. Import the workflow into your n8n project
2. Click the Form Trigger to specify the length of the strings and how many copies to generate
3. The workflow runs then displays the generated random strings

## How to set up
* No additional set up is necessary to execute the workflow manually.

## integration Patterns of interests
