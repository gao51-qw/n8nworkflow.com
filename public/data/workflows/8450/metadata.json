  "description": "## Who's it for\nSocial media managers, content creators, brand managers, and marketing teams who need to track keyword performance and trending content across TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit for competitive analysis and content inspiration.\n## What it does\nThis workflow automatically monitors trending content across three major social media platforms using specified keywords. It scrapes posts from TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit, calculates engagement scores using platform-specific metrics, ranks content by performance, and generates a comprehensive HTML email report with the top-performing posts across all platforms.\n## How it works\nThe workflow follows a sequential multi-platform scraping process:\n\nReddit Scraping: Searches for keyword-based posts and comments with engagement metrics\nInstagram Monitoring: Analyzes hashtag-based content with likes and comments data\nTikTok Analysis: Tracks hashtag performance including views, likes, shares, and comments\nScore Calculation: Applies platform-specific scoring algorithms based on engagement metrics\nUnified Ranking: Combines and ranks all content across platforms by engagement score\nReport Generation: Creates a detailed HTML email report with top performers and analytics\n\n## Requirements\n\nApify account with API access\nGmail account for report delivery\nPlatform-specific scrapers: Reddit Scraper Lite, Instagram Scraper, TikTok Scraper\n\n## How to set up\n### Step 1: Configure Apify credentials\n\nSet up Apify HTTP header authentication in n8n\nEnsure access to the required scrapers:\n\nReddit: trudax~reddit-scraper-lite\nInstagram: apify~instagram-scraper\nTikTok: clockworks~tiktok-scraper\n\n\n\n### Step 2: Customize search parameters\nReddit configuration:\n\nSearch terms: Modify \"searches\" array with your keywords\nContent type: Posts and comments (searchComments can be enabled)\nSort method: \"top\" (alternatives: hot, new, relevance)\nTime period: \"month\" (alternatives: hour, day, week, year, all)\nResult limits: maxItems: 50, maxPostCount: 25\n\nInstagram configuration:\n\nHashtag URLs: Update directUrls with target hashtags\nResults type: \"posts\" (alternatives: stories, reels)\nTime filter: \"onlyPostsNewerThan\": \"7 days\"\nResult limit: resultsLimit: 15\n\nTikTok configuration:\n\nHashtags: Update hashtags array with target keywords\nResults per page: resultsPerPage: 20\nTime filter: \"oldestPostDateUnified\": \"7 days\"\n\n### Step 3: Set up email reporting\n\nConfigure Gmail OAuth2 credentials\nUpdate recipient email address in \"Send a message\" node\nCustomize email subject and styling as needed\n\n### Step 4: Adjust scoring algorithms\nCurrent scoring formulas:\n\nReddit: (upvotes × 1) + (comments × 2)\nInstagram: (likes × 1) + (comments × 2)\nTikTok: (likes × 1) + (comments × 2) + (shares × 3) + (views ÷ 1000)\n\nModify the code nodes to adjust scoring based on your priorities.\n## How to customize the workflow\n### Keyword and hashtag targeting\n\nMultiple keywords: Add arrays of search terms for broader monitoring\nBrand-specific terms: Include brand names, product names, competitor analysis\nSeasonal tracking: Adjust keywords based on campaigns or seasonal trends\nNegative filtering: Exclude irrelevant content with filtering logic\n\n### Platform-specific customization\nReddit

as they indicate deeper engagement\nFilters out low-quality posts and spam content\n\nInstagram scoring approach:\n\nBalances visual appeal (likes) with engagement depth (comments)\nFocuses on recent content to capture trending moments\nExcludes carousel sub-items to avoid duplicate counting\n\nTikTok scoring system:\n\nMulti-factor algorithm considering all engagement types\nViews normalized (÷1000) to balance with other metrics\nShares heavily weighted (×3) as they indicate viral potential\n\n### Level classification\nContent automatically categorized into performance tiers:\n\nHigh: Score ≥ 10,000 (viral or highly engaging content)\nMedium: Score ≥ 1,000 (good engagement, worth monitoring)\nLow: Score &lt; 1,000 (baseline engagement)\n\n## Results interpretation\n###
