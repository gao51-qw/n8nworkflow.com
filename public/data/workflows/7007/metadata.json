  "description": "\n## This n8n template helps you build a full AI-powered LinkedIn content generator with just a few clicks. \n\nPaired with the [free WeWeb UI template](https://go.weweb.io/zoYeg5g), it becomes a ready-to-use web app where users can:\n- Add their own OpenAI API key  \n- Customize the prompt and define 6 content topics  \n- Edit the AI-generated topics  \n- Choose when to generate LinkedIn posts, complete with hashtags and an optional image\n\n## Who This Is For\nPerfect for marketers, indie hackers, and solopreneurs who want to build their personal brand on LinkedIn while staying in control of what gets posted.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 What Makes This Different\n\nUnlike most AI agents, **you stay fully in control**:\n- You define the tone and focus via the prompt.\n- You choose which topics to keep or modify.\n- You decide when to generate a post.\n- You can build on top of this and create your own SaaS product.\n\nIt’s also **modular and extendable**—hook it up to your backend, add user login, or feed AI improvements based on user input.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n1. **Triggering Events**: The app includes 3 pre-configured triggers, ready to be hooked into your WeWeb frontend. Just update the webhook URLs after duplicating the n8n workflow.\n2. **Topic Generation**: A call is made to OpenAI (GPT-4) to generate topic ideas based on your prompt.\n3. **Post Creation**: Once topics are approved or edited, GPT-4 writes full posts with suggested hashtags.\n4. **Image Generation** *(Optional)*: If enabled, a DALL·E call generates a relevant image.\n5. **Everything Stays Local**: All data and images are handled locally, no cloud storage setup needed.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Requirements & Setup\nNo fancy infrastructure required. Here’s what helps you get started:\n- **Free WeWeb account** (recommended) to use the frontend UI template  \n- **OpenAI account** with API access (for GPT-4 and DALL·E)  \n- **n8n account** (self-hosted or cloud) to run the backend workflow  \n\nThe template is **completely free** to use. Since each user adds their own OpenAI API key, you don't need to worry about usage costs or rate limits on your end.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Want to Go Further?\nThis setup is beginner-friendly, but developers can:\n- Add user accounts  \n- Save post history  \n- Feed user feedback back into the prompt logic  \n- Launch their own branded version as a SaaS",
