  "description": "This workflow automatically follows the steps in a custom incident response playbook and manages incidents in PagerDuty, Jira tickets, and notifies the on-call team in Mattermost.\n\nThis workflow consists of three sub-workflows, each automating specific steps in the playbook. Read more about this use case and learn how to set up the workflows step-by-step in the blog tutorial [*How to automate every step of an incident response workflow*](https://n8n.io/blog/automated-incident-response-workflow/).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A PagerDuty account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/pagerduty/)\n- A Mattermost account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/mattermost/)\n- A Jira account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/jira/)\n\n## Nodes\n\n- [Webhook nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) trigger the workflows when an incident is created in PagerDuty, and when the incidedent is acknowledged and resolved.\n- [Mattermost nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mattermost/) create an auxiliary channel for the on-call team to discuss the incident with buttons to acknowledge the incident and mark it as resolved.\n- [PagerDuty nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pagerduty/) update the status of the incident.\n- [Jira nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.jira/) create an issue about the incident and update its status when it's resolved.",
