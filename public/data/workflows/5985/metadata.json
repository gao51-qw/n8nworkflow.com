  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n### How it works\n\nThis n8n workflow helps you build a fully automated **SEO content engine** using [Scrapeless](https://www.scrapeless.com/?utm_source=n8n&utm_campaign=seo-engine) and AI. It’s designed for teams running international websites—such as SaaS products, e-commerce platforms, or content-driven businesses—who want to grow **targeted search traffic** through **high-conversion content**, without relying on manual research or hit-or-miss topics.\n\nThe flow runs in **three key phases**:\n\n#### 🔍 Phase 1: Topic Discovery  \nAutomatically find **high-potential long-tail keywords** based on a seed keyword using Google Trends via Scrapeless. Each keyword is analyzed for trend strength and categorized by priority (P0–P3) with the help of an AI agent.\n\n#### 🧠 Phase 2: Competitor Research  \nFor each P0–P2 keyword, the flow performs a Google Search (via [Deep SerpAPI](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/deep-serp-api?utm_source=n8n&utm_campaign=seo-engine)) and extracts the top 3 organic results. Scrapeless then crawls each result to extract full article content in clean Markdown. This gives you a structured, comparable view of how competitors are writing about each topic.\n\n#### ✍️ Phase 3: AI Article Generation  \nUsing AI (OpenAI or other LLM), the workflow generates a **complete SEO article draft**, including:\n- SEO title\n- Slug\n- Meta description\n- Trend-based strategy summary\n- Structured JSON-based article body with H2/H3 blocks\n\nFinally, the article is stored in **Supabase** (or any other supported DB), making it ready for review, API-based publishing, or further automation.\n\n### Set up steps\n\nThis flow requires intermediate familiarity with n8n and API key setup. Full configuration may take **30–60 minutes**.\n\n#### ✅ Prerequisites\n\n- **Scrapeless** account (for Google Trends and web crawling)\n- **LLM provider** (e.g. OpenAI or Claude)\n- **Supabase** or **Google Sheets** (to store keywords & article output)\n\n#### 🧩 Required Credentials in n8n\n\n- `Scrapeless API Key`\n- `OpenAI (or other LLM)` credentials\n- `Supabase` or `Google Sheets` credentials\n\n---\n\n#### 🔧 Setup Instructions (Simplified)\n\n1. **Input Seed Keyword**  \n   Edit the “Set Seed Keyword” node to define your niche, e.g., `\"project management\"`.\n\n2. **Google Trends via Scrapeless**  \n   Use Scrapeless to retrieve “related queries” and their interest-over-time data.\n\n3. **Trend Analysis with AI Agent**  \n   AI evaluates each keyword's trend strength and assigns a priority (P0–P3).\n\n4. **Filter & Store Keyword Data**  \n   Group and sort keywords by priority, then store them in Google Sheets.\n\n5. **Competitor Research**  \n   Use Deep SerpAPI to get top 3 Google results. Crawl each using Scrapeless.\n\n6. **AI Content Generation**  \n   Feed competitor content + trend data into AI. Output a structured SEO blog article.\n\n7. **Store Final Article**  \n   Save full article JSON (title, meta, slug, content) to Supabase.",
