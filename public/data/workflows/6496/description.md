Extract Gmail Metadata to Google Sheets

This n8n template shows how to fetch new emails from a Gmail account, extract key metadata (sender name, email, subject, and message body), and append each email as a new row in a Google Sheet for record-keeping or follow-up workflows.

Good to Know

Gmail API Quotas: Gmail’s API has usage limits—make sure your application stays under 2500 read requests per day or implement exponential backoff on rate limit errors.

OAuth Credentials: You’ll need to configure OAuth2 credentials in n8n to authenticate with Gmail.

Sheet Structure: Prepare your Google Sheet with columns: Timestamp, Sender Name, Sender Email, Subject, Message.

How It Works

Gmail Trigger: Watches for new emails matching your search criteria (e.g., is:unread).

Extract Metadata: A Function node reads the incoming payload and pulls:

Name and Email from headers or body text

Subject from common subject fields

Message from body, text, or snippet

Timestamp from current system time

Append to Sheet: The Google Sheets node appends each processed email as a row in your target spreadsheet.
