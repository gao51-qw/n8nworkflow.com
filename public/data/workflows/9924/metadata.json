  "description": "This workflow automates company research and intelligence extraction from Glassdoor using Decode API for data retrieval and Google Gemini for AI-powered summarization.\n\n## Who this is for\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* Recruiters, analysts, and market researchers looking for structured insights from company profiles.\n* HR tech developers and AI research teams needing a reliable way to extract and summarize Glassdoor data automatically.\n* Venture analysts or due diligence teams conducting company research combining structured and unstructured content.\n* Anyone who wants instant summaries and insights from Glassdoor company pages without manual scraping.\n\n\n## What problem this workflow solves\n\n* **Manual Data Extraction**: Glassdoor company details and reviews are often scattered and inconsistent, requiring time-consuming copy-paste efforts.\n* **Unstructured Insights**: Raw reviews contain valuable opinions but are not organized for analytical use.\n* **Fragmented Company Data**: Key metrics like ratings, pros/cons, and FAQs are mixed with irrelevant data.\n* **Need for AI Summarization**: Business users need a concise, executive-level summary that combines employee sentiment, culture, and overall performance metrics.\n\nThis workflow automates data mining, summarization, and structuring, transforming Glassdoor data into ready-to-use JSON and Markdown summaries.\n\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThe workflow automates the **end-to-end pipeline** for Glassdoor company research:\n\n1. **Trigger**\n\n   * Start manually by clicking **“Execute Workflow.”**\n\n2. **Set Input Fields**\n\n   * Define `company_url` (e.g., a Glassdoor company profile link) and `geo` (country).\n\n3. **Extract Raw Data from Glassdoor (Decodo Node)**\n\n   * Uses the **Decodo API** to fetch company data — including overview, ratings, reviews, and frequently asked questions.\n\n4. **Generate Structured Data (Google Gemini + Output Parser)**\n\n   * The **Structured Data Extractor** node (powered by Gemini AI) processes raw data into well-defined fields:\n\n     * Company overview (name, size, website, type)\n     * Ratings breakdown\n     * Review snippets (pros, cons, roles)\n     * FAQs\n     * Key takeaways\n\n5. **Summarize the Insights (Gemini AI Summarizer)**\n\n   * Produces a detailed summary highlighting:\n\n     * Company reputation\n     * Work culture\n     * Employee sentiment trends\n     * Strengths and weaknesses\n     * Hiring recommendations\n\n6. **Merge and Format**\n\n   * Combines structured data and summary into a unified object for output.\n\n7. **Export and Save**\n\n   * Converts the final report into JSON and writes it to disk as\n     `C:\\{{CompanyName}}.json`.\n\n8. **Binary Encoding for File Handling**\n\n   * Prepares data in base64 for easy integration with APIs or downloadable reports.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nIf you are new to Decode, please signup on this link [visit.decodo.com](https://visit.decodo.com/dOxzkK)\n\n* **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)\n* **Decodo API credentials** (added as `decodoApi`)\n* **Google Gemini (PaLM) API credentials**\n* Access to the **Glassdoor company URLs**\n\nMake sure to install the Decodo Community Node.\n\n![Decode Community Node](fileId:3018)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Import this workflow JSON file into your n8n instance.\n2. Configure your credentials for:\n\n   * **Decodo API**\n   * **Google Gemini (PaLM) API**\n3. Open the **Set the Input Fields** node and replace:\n\n   * `company_url` → with the Glassdoor URL\n   * `geo` → with the region (e.g., *India*, *US*, etc.)\n4. Execute the workflow.\n5. Check your output folder (`C:\\`) for the exported JSON report.\n\n\n## How to Customize This Workflow\n\nYou can easily adapt this template to your needs:\n\n* **Add Sentiment Analysis**\n\n  * Include another Gemini or OpenAI node to rate sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) per review.\n* **Export to Notion or Google Sheets**\n\n  * Replace the file node with a Notion or Sheets integration for live dashboarding.\n* **Multi-Company Batch Mode**\n\n  * Convert the manual trigger to a spreadsheet or webhook trigger for bulk research automation.\n* **Add Visualization Layer**\n\n  * Connect the output to **Looker Studio** or **Power BI** for analytical dashboards.\n* **Change Output Format**\n\n  * Modify the final write node to generate Markdown or PDF summaries using the `pypandoc` or `reportlab` module.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis n8n workflow combines Decode web scrapping with Google Gemini’s reasoning and summarization power to build a fully automated Glassdoor Research Engine.\n\nWith a single execution, it:\n\n* Extracts structured company details\n* Summarizes thousands of employee reviews\n* Delivers insights in an easy-to-consume format\n\nIdeal for:\n\n* Recruitment intelligence\n* Market research\n* Employer branding\n* Competitive HR analysis\n",
