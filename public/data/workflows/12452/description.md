*This workflow automates the conversion of 2D images into high-quality 3D models (`.glb` format) by integrating **Google Sheets** with the **Hunyuan3D v2** model on **Fal.ai**. It handles the entire pipeline—from fetching image URLs to polling for completion and saving the final asset—eliminating manual modeling time for artists and developers.*

### How it works
This template operates on a schedule to process images in batches or individually:
1.  **Data Retrieval:** The workflow fetches new rows from a Google Sheet where the `RESULT_GLB` column is empty.
2.  **AI Generation:** It sends the `IMAGE_URL` to the **Hunyuan3D v2** API on Fal.ai to initiate the 3D generation process.
3.  **Status Polling:** The workflow automatically enters a loop, checking the job status every 30 seconds until the model is marked "COMPLETED."
4.  **Result Update:** Once finished, it retrieves the download link for the `.glb` file and writes it back to the specific row in your Google Sheet.

### Use Cases
* **Game Development:** Rapidly create prototype props and assets from concept art.
* **E-commerce:** Convert product photos into 3D models for web viewers.
* **AR/VR:** Generate background assets for immersive environments from simple 2D inputs.

### Setup steps
1.  **Google Sheet:**
    * Create a new sheet with two header columns: `IMAGE_URL` and `RESULT_GLB`.
    * Add the images you want to convert in the first column.
2.  **Fal.ai Credentials:**
    * Sign up at [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai) and generate an API Key.
    * In n8n, create a **Header Auth** credential with the name `Authorization` and value `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.
3.  **Configure Nodes:**
    * Update the **Get new image** and **Update Result** nodes to select your specific Google Sheet.
    * Ensure the **HTTP Request** nodes are using your Fal.ai Header Auth credential.
