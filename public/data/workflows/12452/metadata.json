  "title": "Generate 3D models from images using Hunyuan3D v2 and Google Sheets",
  "description": "\n*This workflow automates the conversion of 2D images into high-quality 3D models (`.glb` format) by integrating **Google Sheets** with the **Hunyuan3D v2** model on **Fal.ai**. It handles the entire pipeline—from fetching image URLs to polling for completion and saving the final asset—eliminating manual modeling time for artists and developers.*\n\n![WhatsApp Image 20260104 at 8.28.26 PM.jpeg](fileId:3881)\n### How it works\nThis template operates on a schedule to process images in batches or individually:\n1.  **Data Retrieval:** The workflow fetches new rows from a Google Sheet where the `RESULT_GLB` column is empty.\n2.  **AI Generation:** It sends the `IMAGE_URL` to the **Hunyuan3D v2** API on Fal.ai to initiate the 3D generation process.\n3.  **Status Polling:** The workflow automatically enters a loop, checking the job status every 30 seconds until the model is marked \"COMPLETED.\"\n4.  **Result Update:** Once finished, it retrieves the download link for the `.glb` file and writes it back to the specific row in your Google Sheet.\n\n### Use Cases\n* **Game Development:** Rapidly create prototype props and assets from concept art.\n* **E-commerce:** Convert product photos into 3D models for web viewers.\n* **AR/VR:** Generate background assets for immersive environments from simple 2D inputs.\n\n### Setup steps\n1.  **Google Sheet:**\n    * Create a new sheet with two header columns: `IMAGE_URL` and `RESULT_GLB`.\n    * Add the images you want to convert in the first column.\n2.  **Fal.ai Credentials:**\n    * Sign up at [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai) and generate an API Key.\n    * In n8n, create a **Header Auth** credential with the name `Authorization` and value `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.\n3.  **Configure Nodes:**\n    * Update the **Get new image** and **Update Result** nodes to select your specific Google Sheet.\n    * Ensure the **HTTP Request** nodes are using your Fal.ai Header Auth credential.",
