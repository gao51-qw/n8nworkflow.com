  "description": "This workflow creates nested Google Drive folders from a path string (like `Projects/Clients/Reports`). It automatically handles the necessary folder lookups and creation steps required by Google Drive, then outputs the final folder's ID for immediate use.\n\n### How it works\nThis workflow streamlines the creation of nested folders in Google Drive:\n\n1. **Input:** Provide a `root_folder_id` and a path (e.g., `Projects/Clients/Reports`) as input.\n2. **Path Parsing:** The workflow splits the path into individual folder names (based on the `/` separator)\n3. **Iterative Check & Create:** Loops through each part of your path:\n    - Searches within the _current_ parent folder (starting with the `root_folder_id`) for a subfolder matching the name.\n    - **If found:** Retrieves the existing folder's ID to use as the parent for the next iteration.\n    - **If not found:** Creates a new folder with that name inside the current parent folder and uses the _new_ folder's ID as the parent for the next iteration.\n4. **Output:** Returns the Google Drive Folder ID of the very last folder in the specified path (e.g., the ID for `Reports` in the example above). This ID can then be directly used in subsequent n8n nodes to upload files, create documents, or perform other actions within that specific folder.\n\n\n### Set up steps\nSetting up this workflow requires configuring the connection to Google Drive and knowing where to start creating folders:\n\n1. **Connect Google Drive Account:** Ensure you have a Google Drive credential configured in your n8n instance. Then link your credentials in the workflow: there are 2 Google Drive nodes that will need to be updated.\n2. **Identify Starting Folder ID:** Determine the Google Drive Folder ID where your nested structure should begin. You can either use the root of your Google Drive or a specific folder:\n\t- To use the root of Google Drive, simply set `root_folder_id` to `root` (also called \"My Drive\" in the UI)\n\t- To use a specific folder, open the folder in a webbrowser and look at the URL. The folder ID will be in the last part of the URL: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/THIS_IS_THE_FOLDER_ID`.\n3. **Prepare Inputs for Execution:** When running the workflow (or triggering it), you will need to provide:\n    - `google_drive_folder_id` -&gt; this is the root folder ID you identified in step 2.\n    - `desired_path` -&gt; This is the path you want to create (e.g., `Projects/Clients/Reports`).\n\nHere's an example of how you can call this workflow in your other workflows:\n\n![image.png](fileId:1164)\n\n![image.png](fileId:1165)\n",
