## ⚡ Who Is This For?

- **Busy professionals:** Who want to manage their schedule quickly without opening multiple apps
- **Remote teams:** Needing easy calendar coordination and friendly reminders via Telegram

- **Anyone overwhelmed by calendar clutter:** Automates reminders and event organization effortlessly

## ❓ What Problem Does It Solve?

Manually juggling your calendar events—creating entries, checking your schedule, or remembering appointments—is time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional calendar apps require multiple interactions and can flood you with generic notifications that lack context or personality. Voice commands or natural chat to manage calendars are rarely supported natively.

**CA - Tele Assistant** solves these issues by offering a chat-based, AI-powered interface that understands your natural language or voice, automates calendar operations, and sends smart reminders tailored to your event and preferences. This reduces the cognitive load, minimizes missed appointments, and makes calendar management seamless.

## 🔧 How This Workflow Works

**⏱ Step 1:** Incoming Telegram messages or voice messages trigger the workflow via Telegram Trigger node

**📥 Step 2:** Voice messages are automatically downloaded and transcribed into text using OpenAI

**🔀 Step 3:** A Switch node routes text and voice commands for unified processing

**✍️ Step 4:** The Google Gemini AI model processes natural language commands for calendar actions

**🧠 Step 5:** A Langchain AI agent ("Calendar Manage!") handles operations such as event creation, update, deletion, and fetching events using Google Calendar API tools. It uses session memory to keep contextual chat flow

**🔔 Step 6:** A scheduled trigger every 15 minutes retrieves upcoming calendar events (within 45-60 mins), filters duplicates, and an AI Reminder Message Agent crafts personalized reminder messages

**💬 Step 7:** Reminder messages are sent automatically to the user's Telegram chat, with typing indicators for a humanized feel

**🛠 Step 8:** All data flows and interactions are combined, ensuring seamless conversational experience with real-time calendar sync
