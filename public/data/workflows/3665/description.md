How It Works
-
This N8N workflow creates an automated system for discovering high-potential real estate investment opportunities. The workflow runs on a customizable schedule to scan the market for properties that match your specific criteria, then alerts your team about the most promising leads.

The process follows these steps:

- Connects to BatchData API on a regular schedule to search for properties matching your parameters
- Compares new results with previous scans to identify new listings and property changes
- Applies intelligent filtering to focus on high-potential opportunities (high equity, absentee owners, etc.)
- Retrieves comprehensive property details and owner information for qualified leads
- Delivers formatted alerts through multiple channels (email and Slack/Teams)

Each email alert includes detailed property information, owner details, equity percentage, and a direct Google Maps link to view the property location. The workflow also posts concise notifications to your team's communication channels for quick updates.
