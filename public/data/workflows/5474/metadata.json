  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis workflow retrieves airline web check-in URLs from Google Sheets, scrapes their content, employs an LLM to generate structured JSON data, refreshes the sheet, creates embeddings, and saves them in a Postgres vector DB for future semantic searches or question-answering.\n\n### Quick Notes\n\n- Verify that Google Sheets has accurate URLs for scraping.  \n- Ensure the Postgres vector DB is set up correctly for embedding storage.\n\n### Process Flow\n\n1. Start the workflow with the `Chat Trigger - Start` node.  \n2. Retrieve airline check-in URLs using the `Fetch Airline URLs` node.  \n3. Scrape webpage data with the `Scrape Airline Webpage` node.  \n4. Extract JSON data using the `Extract info with LLM` node with a Chat Model.  \n5. Pause for a response with the `Wait for Response` node.  \n6. Update Google Sheets with the `Store Extracted Data` node.  \n7. Create embeddings with the `Generate Embeddings` node and store in Postgres vector DB with the `Save to Vector DB` node.  \n8. Break down long text with the `Split Long Text` node and delay the next batch with the `Wait Before Next Batch` node.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- Import the workflow into n8n and set up Google Sheets and Postgres vector DB credentials.  \n- Run a test with a sample URL to confirm scraping and embedding storage.\n\n### Tailored Adjustments\n\nTweak the `Extract info with LLM` node to adjust JSON output or modify the `Fetch Airline URLs` node to pull from different sheet fields.",
