  "description": "## How It Works\nScheduled triggers initiate automated contract reviews. The system fetches documents from cloud storage and email, then uses AI to extract key terms, obligations, and compliance requirements. Multi-model parsing identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and potential risks. A scoring engine evaluates severity and routes alerts to the appropriate channels. The workflow then updates the CLM system and produces audit-ready documentation for tracking and governance.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. **Storage:** Configure access to your Google Drive or webhook-based document repository.\n2. **Email:** Connect Gmail to automatically ingest contract-related emails.\n3. **AI Extraction:** Add the OpenAI API key and define extraction prompts for obligations and terms.\n4. **CLM System:** Enter credentials for your contract lifecycle management platform.\n5. **Alerts:** Set up Google Sheets logging and connect dashboard endpoints for risk and compliance alerts.\n\n## Prerequisites\nCloud storage access; Gmail credentials; OpenAI API key; CLM system credentials; document processing license\n\n## Use Cases\nContract renewal tracking; compliance audits; risk management; vendor agreement reviews; regulatory adherence monitoring\n\n## Customization\nAdjust risk thresholds; modify extraction rules; add Slack notifications; extend compliance frameworks \n\n## Benefits\nReduces review time 80%; catches compliance gaps; automates audit trails;  \n",
