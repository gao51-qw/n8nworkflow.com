## How It Works
This workflow transforms n8n into a smart Web Lead Form alternative to Salesforce's traditional Web-to-Lead, capturing leads, creating Salesforce records, and sending AI-personalized responses via email or SMS.

- **Capture Submission**: User submits form data (name, email, phone, description, preference) via n8n's hosted form.
- **Create Lead**: Maps data to a new Salesforce Lead.
- **Personalize Message**: Uses OpenAI to generate a tailored welcome based on description and preference (detailed for email, concise for SMS).
- **Route Outreach**: Branches to send via Twilio SMS or SMTP email depending on preference.

## Set Up Steps
Setup takes about 15-30 minutes if you have credentials ready. Focus on connecting services; detailed configs are in workflow sticky notes.

- Duplicate this template in n8n.
- Add your Salesforce, OpenAI, Twilio, and SMTP credentials (no hardcoding—use n8n's credential manager).
- Customize form fields if needed and test with sample data.
- Activate and share the form URL on your site.
