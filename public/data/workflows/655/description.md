## Who this is for
Every who's interested in seeing how merging items works in n8n

## What this workflow does
This workflow generates two sets of sample data: one with names and corresponding languages, and another with greetings and corresponding languages using the Code node. It then merges these two datasets using the Merge node based on the common “language” field, combining all entries that share the same language.
