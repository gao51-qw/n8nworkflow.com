Description
An intelligent conversational AI system that provides contextual responses by combining chat history, vector database knowledge retrieval, and web search capabilities.
How it Works (High-level steps)

Message Detection: Google Sheets trigger monitors for new user messages and filters out already-processed entries
Context Preparation: Extracts user message, retrieves chat history, and formats conversation context with system prompt
Knowledge Retrieval: AI agent searches vector database for relevant context using Supabase + OpenAI embeddings
Response Generation: LangChain agent processes the request using:

OpenAI GPT-4 language model
Vector store tool for knowledge base queries
SerpAPI tool for web search when needed
Buffer memory for conversation continuity


Response Storage: Updates Google Sheets with AI response and assigns unique timestamp ID

Setup Steps

Configure Google Sheets with columns: user_message, ai_respond, id
Set up Supabase vector store with OpenAI embeddings
Connect OpenAI API credentials (GPT-4 + embeddings)
Configure SerpAPI for web search functionality
Set up Google Sheets trigger and update permissions
