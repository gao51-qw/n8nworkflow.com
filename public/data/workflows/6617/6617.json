    "description": "## Who's it for\n\nThis workflow is for **community builders, marketers, consultants, coaches, and thought leaders** who want to grow their presence in **Skool communities** through strategic, value-driven engagement. It's especially useful for professionals who want to:\n\n- Build authority in their niche by providing helpful insights\n- Scale their community engagement without spending hours manually browsing posts\n- Identify high-value conversation opportunities that align with their expertise\n- Maintain authentic, helpful presence across multiple Skool communities\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving\n\nMany professionals struggle to consistently engage meaningfully in online communities due to:\n- **Time constraints**: Manually browsing multiple communities daily is time-consuming\n- **Missed opportunities**: Important discussions happen when you're not online\n- **Inconsistent engagement**: Sporadic participation reduces visibility and relationship building\n- **Generic responses**: Quick replies often lack the depth needed to showcase expertise\n\nThis workflow solves these problems by automatically monitoring your target Skool communities, using AI to identify posts where your expertise could add genuine value, generating thoughtful contextual comment suggestions, and organizing opportunities for efficient manual review and engagement.\n\n## How it works\n\n### Scheduled Community Monitoring\nRuns daily at 7 PM to scan your configured Skool communities for new posts and discussions from the last 24 hours.\n\n### Intelligent Configuration Management\n- Pulls settings from Airtable including target communities, your domain expertise, and preferred tools\n- Possibility to add several configurations\n- Filters for active configurations only\n- Processes multiple community URLs efficiently\n\n### Comprehensive Data Extraction\nUses Apify Skool Scraper to collect:\n- Post content and metadata\n- Comments over 50 characters (quality filter)\n- Direct links for easy access\n\n### AI-Powered Opportunity Analysis\nLeverages OpenAI GPT-4.1 to:\n- Analyze each post for engagement opportunities based on your expertise\n- Identify specific trigger sentences that indicate a need you can address\n- Generate contextual, helpful comment suggestions\n- Maintain authentic tone without being promotional\n\n### Smart Filtering and Organization\n- Only surfaces genuine opportunities where you can add value\n- Stores results in Airtable with detailed reasoning\n- Provides suggested comments ready for review and posting\n- Tracks engagement history to avoid duplicate responses\n\n### Quality Control and Review\nAll opportunities are saved to Airtable where you can:\n- Review AI reasoning and suggested responses\n- Edit comments before posting\n- Track which opportunities you've acted on\n- Monitor success patterns over time\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Required credentials\n- **OpenAI API key** - For GPT-4.1 powered opportunity analysis\n- **Airtable Personal Access Token** - For configuration and results storage\n- **Apify API token** - For Skool community scraping\n\n### Airtable base setup\n\nCreate an Airtable base with two tables:\n\n**Config Table** (`config`):\n- `Name` (Single line text): Your configuration name\n- `Skool URLs` (Long text): Comma-separated list of Skool community URLs\n- `cookies` (Long text): Your Skool session cookies for authenticated access\n- `Domain of Activity` (Single line text): Your area of expertise (e.g., \"AI automation\", \"Digital marketing\")\n- `Tools Used` (Single line text): Your preferred tools to recommend (e.g., \"n8n\", \"Zapier\")\n- `active` (Checkbox): Whether this configuration is currently active\n\n**Results Table** (`Table 1`):\n- `title` (Single line text): Post title/author\n- `url` (URL): Direct link to the post\n- `reason` (Long text): AI's reasoning for the opportunity\n- `trigger` (Long text): Specific sentence that triggered the opportunity\n- `suggested answer` (Long text): AI-generated comment suggestion\n- `config` (Link to another record): Reference to the config used\n- `date` (Date): When the opportunity was found\n- `Select` (Single select): Status tracking (not commented/commented)\n\n### Skool cookies setup\nTo access private Skool communities, you'll need to:\n1. **Install Cookie Editor**: Go to Chrome Web Store and install the \"Cookie Editor\" extension\n2. **Login to Skool**: Navigate to any Skool community you want to monitor and log in\n3. **Open Cookie Editor**: Click the Cookie Editor extension icon in your browser toolbar\n4. **Export cookies**: \n   -

Your contributions subtly demonstrate expertise in {user_domain} without explicitly promoting your own community or product.\n\n🎯 Task\nAnalyze a post or comment and determine whether it offers a relevant opportunity to engage with a valuable, helpful comment related to {user_domain}. Return the result as JSON.\n\n📌 Specifics\nOutput must follow this JSON schema:\n\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"opportunity\": true | false,\n  \"reason\": \"why this is or isn't a fit for {user_domain} support\",\n  \"trigger_sentence\": \"exact phrase or sentence from the post/comment indicating need\",\n  \"suggested_comment\": \"only include this if opportunity is true, respond in the same language as the original post\"\n}\nThink like a value-driven expert spotting inefficiencies or challenges where {user_domain} could help.\n\nAlways suggest {user_tool} if a tool is mentioned.\nHelping here could spark a valuable connection. Respond with heart and clarity.\n\nDo not promote yourself or your community directly. Be insightful, curious, and helpful.\n\n🌍 Context\nYou are using this automation to grow visibility by helping users who express challenges or frustrations that {user_domain} can solve. Your smart, relevant comments will inspire profile visits and interest in your expertise—organically and trust-based.\n\n🧪 Examples\n✅ Opportunity Exists\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"opportunity\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The user is overwhelmed managing manual tasks, which can be streamlined using {user_tool}.\",\n  \"trigger_sentence\": \"I can't keep up with replying to all DMs and booking calls manually.\",\n  \"suggested_comment\": \"I totally get that—juggling messages and scheduling is exhausting. You might want to try using a tool like user_tool}} to automate that flow and save hours each week.\"\n}\n❌ No Opportunity\njson\nCopy\nEdit\n{\n  \"opportunity\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The post is purely motivational with no mention of workflows, tools, or pain points that {user_domain} could solve.\",\n  \"trigger_sentence\": \"Just stay consistent and the results will come!\"\n}\n📝 Notes\nTranslate suggested_comment to match the post’s original language.\n\nBe helpful, not salesy.\n\nIf a tool is mentioned, always recommend {user_tool}.\n\nIf there's no clear problem or inefficiency, set \"opportunity\": false.\n\n"
