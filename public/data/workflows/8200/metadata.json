  "description": "# Workflow Summary\n\n### This automation keeps your Supabase vector database synchronized with documents stored in Google Drive, while also making the data contextual and vector based for better retrieval.\n\n### When a file is added or modified, the workflow extracts its text, splits it into smaller chunks, and enriches each chunk with contextual metadata (such as summaries and document details). It then generates embeddings using OpenAI and stores both the vector data and metadata in Supabase. If a file changes, the old records are replaced with updated, contextualized content.\n\n### The result is a continuously updated and context-aware vector database, enabling highly accurate hybrid search and retrieval. \n\n\n# To setup\n\n## 1. Connect Google Drive\n•\tCreate a Google Drive folder to watch.\n•\tConnect your Google Drive account in n8n and authorize access.\n•\tPoint the Google Drive Trigger node to this folder (new/modified files trigger the flow).\n\n## 2. Configure Supabase\n•\tPlease refer to the Setting Up Supabase Sticky Note. \n\n## 3. Connect OpenAI (or your embedding model)\n•\tAdd your OpenAI API key in n8n credentials.\n",
