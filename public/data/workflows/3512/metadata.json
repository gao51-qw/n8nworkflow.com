  "description": "# Google Drive Duplicate File Manager 🧹📁\n\n**Purpose:** Automate the process of finding and managing duplicate files in your Google Drive.\n\n**Who's it for?**\n\n* Individuals and teams aiming to streamline their Google Drive.\n* Anyone tired of manual duplicate file cleanup.\n\n**What it Solves:**\n\n* Saves storage space 💾.\n* Reduces file confusion 😕➡️🙂.\n* Automates tedious cleanup tasks 🤖.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  **Trigger:** Monitors a Google Drive folder for new files.\n2.  **Configuration:** Sets rules for keeping and handling duplicates.\n3.  **Find Duplicates:** Identifies duplicate files based on their content (MD5Checksum).\n4.  **Action:** Either moves duplicates to trash or renames them.\n\n**Setup Guide:**\n\n1.  **Google Drive Trigger ⏰:**\n    * Set up the trigger to watch a specific folder or your entire drive (use caution with the root folder! ⚠️).\n    * Configure the polling interval (default: every 15 minutes).\n2.  **Config Node ⚙️:**\n    * **keep:** Choose whether to keep the \"first\" or \"last\" uploaded file (default: \"last\").\n    * **action:** Select \"trash\" to delete duplicates or \"flag\" to rename them with \"DUPLICATE-\" (default: \"flag\").\n    * **owner & folder:** Taken from the trigger. Only change if needed.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **Google Drive API limits:** Be mindful of API usage.\n* **Folder Scope:** The workflow handles one folder depth by default. (WARNING: If configured to work with the Root folder / all files in all sub-directories are processed so **USE THIS OPTION WITH CAUTION** since the workflow might trash/rename important files)\n* **Google Apps:** Google docs are ignored since they are not actual binary-files and their content can't be compared.\n\n\n**Enjoy your clean Google Drive! ✨**",
