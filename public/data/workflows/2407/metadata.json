  "description": "## What this template does\nThis workflow will collect order data as it is produced, then send a summary email of all orders at the end of every day, formatted in a table. It receives new orders via webhook and stores in Airtable. At 7PM every day, it sends a summary email with the day's orders in a HTML table\n\n## Setup:\n[Instructions Video](https://vimeo.com/1012686665?share=copy#t=0)\n 1. Create a new table in Airtable and give it a field *time* with type date, *orderID* with type number, and *orderPrice* also with type number. \n 2. Create a new access token if you haven't already at https://airtable.com/create/tokens/new. Make sure to give the token the scopes *data.records:read*, *data.records:write*, *schema.bases:read* and access to whichever table you choose to store the orders. A pop-up window appears with the token. Use this token to make `Create New Credential` > `Access Token` for Airtable in the `Store Order` and `Airtable Get Today's Orders` nodes.\n 3. Create access credentials for your Gmail as described here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials. Use the credentials from your *client_secret.json* in the `Send to Gmail` node.\n 4. In the `Store Order` node, change *Base* and *Table* to the database and table in your Airtable account you wish to use to store orders. Make sure to use these same values in the `Airtable Get Today's Orders` node.\n 5. Every time an order is created in your system, send a POST request to Webhook from your order software. Each request must contain a single order containing fields *'orderID'* and *'orderPrice'* (or, edit `Set Order Fields` to select which incoming fields you wish to save)\n 6. Change the schedule time for sending email from `Everyday at 7PM` to whichever time you choose. \n \n\n## Test:\n- Activate the workflow.\n- From the node `Webhook`, copy *Production URL*\n- Send the following CURL request to the URL given to you:\n` curl -X POST   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '{\"orderID\": 12345, \"orderPrice\": 99.99}' YOUR_URL_HERE`\n- It should say *Node executed successfully*. Now check your Airtable and confirm the order was stored in the right place.",
