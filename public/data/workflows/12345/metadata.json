  "description": "# Scrape physician profiles from BrowserAct to Google Sheets\n\nThis workflow automates the process of building a targeted database of healthcare providers by scraping physician details for a specific location and syncing them to your records. It leverages BrowserAct to extract data from healthcare directories and ensures your database stays clean by preventing duplicate entries.\n\n## Target Audience\nMedical recruiters, pharmaceutical sales representatives, lead generation specialists, and healthcare data analysts.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Define Location**: The workflow starts by setting the target `Location` and `State` in a Set node.\n2. **Scrape Data**: A **BrowserAct** node executes a task (using the \"Physician Profile Enricher\" template) to search a healthcare directory (e.g., Healow) for doctors matching the criteria.\n3. **Parse JSON**: A **Code** node takes the raw string output from the scraper and parses it into individual JSON objects.\n4. **Update Database**: The workflow uses a **Google Sheets** node to append new records or update existing ones based on the physician's name, preventing duplicates.\n5. **Notify Team**: A **Slack** node sends a message to a specific channel to confirm the batch job has finished successfully.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **BrowserAct**, **Google Sheets**, and **Slack** accounts in n8n.\n2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Physician Profile Enricher** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.\n3. **Setup Google Sheet**: Create a new Google Sheet with the required headers (listed below).\n4. **Select Spreadsheet**: Open the **Google Sheets** node and select your newly created file and sheet.\n5. **Set Variables**: Open the **Define Location** node and input your target `Location` (City) and `State`.\n6. **Configure Notification**: Open the **Slack** node and select the channel where you want to receive alerts.\n\n## Google Sheet Headers\nTo use this workflow, create a Google Sheet with the following headers:\n* Name\n* Specialty\n* Address\n\n## Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** account with the **Physician Profile Enricher** template.\n* **Google Sheets** account.\n* **Slack** account.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n1. **Change the Data Source**: Modify the BrowserAct template to scrape a different directory (e.g., Zocdoc or WebMD) and update the Google Sheet columns accordingly.\n2. **Switch Notifications**: Replace the Slack node with a **Microsoft Teams**, **Discord**, or **Email** node to suit your team's communication preferences.\n3. **Enrich Data**: Add an **AI Agent** node after the Code node to format addresses or research the specific clinics listed.\n\n## Need Help?\n* [How to Find Your BrowserAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://docs.browseract.com)\n* [How to Connect n8n to BrowserAct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n\n---\n### Workflow Guidance and Showcase Video\n\n* #### [Automate Medical Lead Gen: Scrape Healow to Google Sheets & Slack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ_Jq_b2-Ww)",
