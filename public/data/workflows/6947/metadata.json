  "description": "## Copy n8n workflows to a slave n8n repository\n\nInspired by [Alex Kim's workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/3048-clone-n8n-workflows-between-instances-using-n8n-api/), this version adds the ability to keep multiple versions of the same workflow on the destination instance. Each copied workflow’s name is prefixed with the date (`YYYY_MM_DD_`), enabling simple version tracking. Process details and workflow counts are recorded centrally in Notion.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Workflows from the **source n8n instance** are copied to the **destination** using the n8n API node.\n- On the destination, each workflow name is prefixed with the current date (e.g., `2025_08_03_PDF Summarizer`), so you can keep multiple daily versions.\n- The workflow tracks and saves:\n    - The date of execution.\n    - Number of workflows processed.\n    - Both details are recorded in Notion.\n\n### Rolling retention policy example:\n\n- **Day 1:** Workflows are saved with `2025_08_03_` prefix.\n- **Day 2:** New set saved with `2025_08_04_`.\n- **Day 3:** Day 1’s set is deleted, new set saved as `2025_08_05_`.\n- To keep more days, adjust the “Subtract From Date” node.\n\n## How to use\n\n1. **Create a Notion database** with one page and three fields:\n    - `sequence`: Should contain `\"prefix\"`.\n    - `Value`: Today's date as `YYYY_MM_DD_`.\n    - `Comment`: Number of saved workflows.\n\n2. **Configure the Notion node**:\n    - Enter your Notion credentials.\n    - Link to the created database/page.\n\n3. **Update the \"Subtract From Date\" node**:\n    - Set how many days’ versions you want to keep (default: 2 days).\n    - Set the limit to 1 in the \"Limit\" node for testing.\n4. **Input credentials** for both source and destination n8n instances.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Notion** for tracking execution date and workflow count.\n- **n8n API Keys** for both source and destination instances. Ensure you have the necessary **API permissions** (read, create, delete workflows)\n- **n8n version** this workflow was tested on 1.103.2 (Ubuntu)\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- Comment this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/n8n-about_n8n-activity-7357850874024456192-c0eL/) or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaneheckel/)\n- Ask in the [Forum](https://community.n8n.io/)!",
