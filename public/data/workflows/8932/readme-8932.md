# Automated sprint reports from Jira to stakeholders via Gmail

> ## Description

Automated workflow that generates a Sprint Report from Jira and delivers it by Gmail.

The flow fetches sprint issues from Jira, validates and normalizes the data, calculates metrics (tickets, story points, blockers, completion rate), generates an HTML report, and sends it by email.

## Context

This template helps teams keep stakeholders updated automatically of the current sprint.
Instead of manually compiling Jira data, the report is generated and sent on schedule (e.g., every Friday at 17:00).

It’s production-friendly, reusable, and works across Jira projects.

## Target Users

- Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches who need sprint reports for retrospectives.

- Product Owners who want a weekly overview of sprint progress.

- Project Managers tracking Jira delivery KPIs.

- Engineering teams wanting automated status reporting without extra overhead.

## Technical Requirements

- Jira Cloud project + API email + API token + permission to read issues.

- Gmail credential for notifications.
