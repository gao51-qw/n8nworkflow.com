#  📰 Related News to Content Marketing Automation

## Overview

This workflow automatically collects news from an RSS feed, identifies the most relevant article(s), and generates ready-to-use social media and blog content tailored for Medium, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

It’s ideal for:
	•	Marketing teams who want a steady flow of fresh content.
	•	Social media managers looking to save time on research and writing.
	•	Startups and creators who want consistent posting with minimal effort.

Instead of manually scanning articles and drafting posts, this automation gives you AI-generated content with your preferred tone of voice — and even sends confirmation emails so you can review before posting.


## Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, make sure you have:
	•	✅ An n8n account (self-hosted or cloud).
	•	✅ An OpenAI API key for content generation.
	•	✅ An RSS feed URL for your industry or niche.
	•	✅ A Gmail account (or another configured email service) to receive content confirmation messages.


## Setup Instructions

1. Import the Workflow

Download and import this workflow into your n8n instance.

2. Configure the RSS Feed
	•	Open the RSS Read node.
	•	Replace the sample URL with your preferred news source(s).

3. Connect OpenAI
	•	Open the OpenAI Chat Model node.
	•	Add your OpenAI API Key in the credentials.
	•	(Optional) Adjust the prompts in the “Tone of Voice Writer” or “Instagram & LinkedIn Writer” nodes to match your brand’s style.

4. Set Up Gmail
	•	Open the Send Content Confirmation nodes.
	•	Connect your Gmail (or another email service).
	•	Add the email address where you want to receive content drafts.

5. Run & Automate
	•	Trigger the workflow manually with Execute Workflow to test.
	•	Once tested, enable the Schedule Trigger node to run it automatically (e.g., daily).


## Customization Options
	•	🔄 Add more platforms: extend the workflow for Twitter, Facebook, or Slack.
	•	✏️ Adjust tone & length: update prompts in AI nodes (casual, professional, humorous, etc.).
	•	✅ Human-in-the-loop: add approval steps before publishing directly.
	•	🌍 Change news sources: swap RSS feeds for different industries or niches.
