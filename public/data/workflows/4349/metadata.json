  "description": "# Google Drive Nested Folder Structure Cloner\n\n## How it works\n* Takes any Google Drive folder structure and creates an exact copy with custom naming\n* Perfect for agencies, consultants, or anyone who needs identical folder structures for multiple projects\n* Creates folder hierarchy only (no files are copied)\n* Handles nested folders automatically with level-by-level processing\n\n## Set up steps\n* Get your source and destination folder IDs from Google Drive URLs\n* Edit the 3 variables in the CONFIG node (takes 30 seconds)\n* Connect your Google Drive credentials in n8n\n* Run the workflow and watch it create your folder structure\n* For deeply nested folders, run multiple times to process each level\n\n## What you'll need\n* Google Drive account with API access configured in n8n\n* Read permissions on source folder, write permissions on destination folder\n\n## Pro tips\n* Create a \"Templates\" folder in Google Drive for your reusable structures\n* The workflow intelligently skips folders that already exist\n* Each run processes the next level down for nested structures\n* Check the final report to see exactly what was created, skipped, or failed",
