  "description": "Use n8n to bring data from any API to your AI. This workflow uses the [Chat Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/) to provide the chat interface, and the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) to call a second workflow that calls the API. \n\nThe second workflow uses AI functionality to refine the API request based on the user's query. It then makes an API call, and returns the response to the main workflow.\n\nThis workflow is used in [Advanced AI examples | Call an API to fetch data](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/) in the documentation.\n\nTo use this workflow:\n\n1. Load it into your n8n instance.\n2. Add your credentials as prompted by the notes.\n\n**Requires n8n 1.28.0 or above**\n",
