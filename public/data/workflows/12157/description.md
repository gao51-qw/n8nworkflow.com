This workflow automates the initial screening process for new job applications, freeing up your recruitment team to focus on qualified candidates. It receives applications from a webhook, uses OpenAI (GPT-4) to analyze resumes for skill and culture fit, generates interview questions, logs the results to Google Sheets, sends interview invitations via Gmail, and notifies your team on Slack.


## 🚀 Who is this for?
- **HR and Recruitment Teams** looking to automate repetitive screening tasks.
- **Hiring Managers** who want a consistent, data-driven first pass on applicants.
- **Startups and SMBs** aiming to build an efficient, scalable hiring pipeline without a large HR team.


## 💡 How it works
1.  **Receive Application**: The workflow triggers when a new application is submitted via a webhook from your job board or application form.
2.  **Extract & Analyze**: It downloads the resume/CV, extracts the text, and sends it to **OpenAI (GPT-4)** with a custom prompt.
3.  **Score & Generate**: The AI scores the candidate on skill match and culture fit, provides a summary, and generates tailored interview questions based on their experience.
4.  **Log Data**: The evaluation scores, AI summary, and candidate information are appended to a new row in a **Google Sheet** for tracking.
5.  **Schedule Interview**: A personalized email is sent to the candidate via **Gmail** with a link to schedule their interview.
6.  **Notify Team**: A summary card with the AI evaluation and links to the full report is posted in a **Slack** channel to keep the hiring team informed.


## ⚙️ How to set up
1.  **Configure Credentials**: Set up your credentials for OpenAI, Google (for both Sheets and Gmail), and Slack in n8n.
2.  **Webhook URL**: Copy the "Production URL" from the "Webhook: New Application" node and set it as the destination in your job board's webhook settings (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, or a web form).
3.  **Google Sheet**: Create a Google Sheet to track applicants. Update the "G Sheets: Save Evaluation" node with your Spreadsheet ID and Sheet Name. Ensure the columns in your sheet match the data you want to save.
4.  **Customize Prompts & Email**:
    -   Modify the prompts in the two **OpenAI** nodes to match your company's values and the specific job requirements.
    -   Update the **Gmail** node with your email content and the logic for your scheduling link (e.g., Calendly, SavvyCal).
