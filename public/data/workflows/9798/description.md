## Automated Invoice Creation & Team Notification with Jotform, Xero, Outlook, and Telegram
This workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **Xero**, generating an invoice, emailing it, and notifying the sales team for example after sometime if no action has been taken yet (via **Telegram**)  — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**).

## How It Works
1. **Receive Submission**
* Triggered when a user submits a form.
* Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.

2. **Check If Customer Exists**
* Searches Xero to determine if the customer already exists.
* ✅ **If Customer Exists:** **Update** customer details.
* ❌ **If Customer Doesn’t Exist:** **Create** a new customer in Xero.

3. **Create The Invoice**
* Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.

4. **Send The Invoice**
* Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.

5. **Wait For Sometime**
Now we will wait for 30 seconds (by default, you can change it) and then get the invoice details from Xero

6. **Notify The Team**
* Notifies the sales team for example via Telegram in case no action has been taken on the invoice and thus the team can act fast.

## Who Can Benefit from This Workflow?
* **Freelancers**
* **Service Providers**
* **Consultants & Coaches**
* **Small Businesses**
* **E-commerce or Custom Product Sellers**
