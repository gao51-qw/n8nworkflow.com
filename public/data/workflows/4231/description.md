## Google Calendar MCP – Context-Aware Calendar Operations

This n8n template implements an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**-compliant module for managing **Google Calendar** events in a context-aware, conflict-free manner.

### 🧠 What It Does

This MCP enables structured interaction with Google Calendar based on context and intent, ensuring reliable, reusable operations with awareness of existing data and state.

### ✅ Core Capabilities

- **Context-aware event creation**  
  Prevents overlapping by validating time availability before creating new events.

- **Gap validation**  
  Checks if a time range is busy or free, enabling smarter scheduling decisions.

- **Conditional updates**  
  Only updates events after confirming their existence and current state.

- **Safe deletion**  
  Removes events using MCP principles of validation and traceability.

### 🚀 How to Use

To use this MCP in your context-aware systems:

1. Deploy the template in your n8n instance.
2. Locate the **Server node** in the workflow — it exposes a **Server-Sent Events (SSE) URL**.
3. Copy that SSE URL.
4. Use that URL as the entry point for your MCP client or orchestrator.

This URL acts as the communication bridge, allowing you to interact with the MCP-compliant Google Calendar logic using standard MCP semantics.![Screenshot 20250517 at 2.00.14 PM.png](fileId:1339)
