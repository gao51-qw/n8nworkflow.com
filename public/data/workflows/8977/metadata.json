  "description": "## AI-Powered Lead Triage and Response System 🤖\n\nThis advanced workflow creates a customized, embedded lead-capture form, automatically logs client data to a spreadsheet, and uses AI to instantly analyze and summarize the lead for rapid human follow-up.\n\n### **How it works**\n\n1.  A potential client fills out the **Gurey AI partnership form** (built-in n8n form trigger).\n2.  The workflow immediately **logs all submitted data** to a designated Google Sheet.\n3.  An **AI Agent** receives the raw data and is instructed to condense it into a factual, concise client summary.\n4.  A second **AI Agent** generates a **personalized welcome and confirmation email** to the client, using the AI-generated summary and original goals to make the email highly relevant.\n\n---\n\n### **Set up steps (2-3 minutes)** ⏱️\n\n1.  **Google Sheets:** Create a new Google Sheet to log your client data, making sure the column headers match the form field names (e.g., \"First Name\", \"📧 Email\", etc.).\n2.  **Credentials:** Add two credentials to your n8n instance:\n    * **Google Sheets OAuth2 API**\n    * **OpenRouter API** (for the AI Agents)\n3.  **Update Nodes:** Connect the new credentials to the **\"Log client data\"** and **\"OpenRouter Chat Model\"** nodes.\n4.  **Finalize:** Open the **\"Log client data\"** node and select your newly created Google Sheet.\n\n*Detailed descriptions and links are available in the sticky notes within the workflow.* 🤓",
