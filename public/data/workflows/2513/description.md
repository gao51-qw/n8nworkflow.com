## Use Case
Transform and optimize images for web use:
- You need to host local images online
- You want to reduce image file sizes automatically
- You need image URLs for web content
- You want to generate and optimize AI-created images

## What this Workflow Does
The workflow processes images through two services:
- Uploads images to ImgBB for hosting and URL generation (free but need API key)
- Optimizes images using ReSmush.it to reduce file size (free)
- Optional: Creates images using OpenAI's image generation
- Returns optimized image URLs ready for use

## Setup
1. Create an [ImgBB account](https://api.imgbb.com/) and get your API key
2. Add your ImgBB API key to the HTTP Request node (key parameter)
3. Optional: Configure OpenAI credentials for image generation
4. Connect your image input source

## How to Adjust it to Your Needs
- Skip OpenAI nodes if using your own image files
- Adjust image optimization parameters
- Customize image hosting settings
- Modify output format for your needs
