  "description": "This workflow automates the process of **generating 3D human body models** (in `.glb` format) from **single image** using  SAM-3D model. It operates by connecting a Google Sheet as a data source with the external AI processing API. \n\n| Start | Result|\n|--------|---------|\n| ![image](https://n3wstorage.b-cdn.net/n3witalia/golf-swing.jpg) | ![image](https://n3wstorage.b-cdn.net/n3witalia/golf-swing-result.png) |\n\n\n\n---\n\n### **Use Cases**\n\n#### **1. ✅ Sports Analysis & Motion Optimization**\n\n3D models allow precise analysis of posture, angles, and technique.\nPossible applications:\n\n* **Golf swing analysis**\n  Identify stance, rotation, shoulder/hip alignment, and follow-through.\n* **Tennis serve biomechanics**\n  Optimize shoulder rotation, racket angle, leg push-off.\n* **Running gait analysis**\n  Evaluate stride symmetry, foot strike, and body tilt.\n* **Cycling posture optimization**\n  Reduce drag by analyzing torso angle and hand position.\n* **Swimming technique evaluations**\n  Compare ideal vs. actual joint angles.\n\n#### **2. ✅ Fitness, Health & Physiotherapy**\n\n3D models can visually highlight imbalances or incorrect positions.\n\n* **Posture correction assessments**\n  Identify spinal misalignment or uneven weight distribution.\n* **Physical therapy progress tracking**\n  Compare poses over time to assess recovery.\n* **Ergonomics and workplace safety**\n  Evaluate whether a worker’s posture is safe during lifting or repetitive tasks.\n* **Home fitness coaching**\n  Automated feedback for yoga, pilates, stretching exercises.\n\n#### **3. ✅ Fashion, Apparel & Virtual Try-On**\n\nPhotorealistic body reconstruction helps generate tailored outfits or evaluate fit.\n\n* **Virtual try-on for clothing brands**\n  Produce accurate 3D avatars to test garments digitally.\n* **Custom-made fashion**\n  Use 3D measurements for bespoke tailoring patterns.\n* **Model pose simulation**\n  Test clothing fit in dynamic or unusual positions (e.g., dance, athletic poses).\n\n#### **4. ✅ Gaming, Animation & Digital Content Creation**\n\nQuick 3D reconstruction reduces production time for digital humans.\n\n* **Character rigging from real people**\n  Generate 3D avatars ready for animation.\n* **Motion capture alternatives**\n  Recreate specific poses without expensive mocap systems.\n* **VR/AR content creation**\n  Deploy 3D characters into immersive environments.\n* **Comics, illustration, and concept art**\n  Use 3D poses as reference models to speed up drawing.\n\n#### **5. ✅ Medical, Research & Educational Applications**\n\nHuman-body 3D models provide insights in scientific or practical contexts.\n\n* **Anthropometric measurements**\n  Estimate height, limb length, body proportions from images.\n* **Posture and musculoskeletal studies**\n  Analyze joint angle distribution in different poses.\n* **Rehabilitation robotics or exoskeleton design**\n  Fit devices to a patient’s real body shape.\n* **Training materials for anatomy or movement science**\n  Generate accurate pose examples for students.\n\n#### **6.✅  Security, Forensics & Reconstruction**\n\nWhen allowed ethically and legally, 3D models can support investigations.\n\n* **Reconstruction of accident scenes**\n  Understand how a person fell, collided, or moved.\n* **Analysis of body posture in video frames**\n  Useful for determining gesture patterns or mobility constraints.\n\n#### **7. ✅ Art, Photography & Creative Industries**\n\nArtists often need unusual or complex human poses.\n\n* **Pose reference creation**\n  For painting, 3D sculpting, illustration, or storyboarding.\n* **Recreating dynamic action scenes**\n  Parkour, martial arts, ballet, expressive dance.\n* **Virtual studio lighting tests**\n  Apply simulated lighting to a 3D model before shooting.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\nThis workflow automates the process of generating 3D human body models (in `.glb` format) from single images using the FAL.AI SAM-3D service. It operates by connecting a Google Sheet as a data source with the external AI processing API. Here is the operational flow:\n\n1.  **Trigger & Data Fetch:** The workflow begins either manually (via \"Test workflow\") or on a schedule. It queries a designated Google Sheet to find rows where the \"3D RESULT\" column is empty, indicating a new image needs processing.\n2.  **API Request & Queuing:** For each new image, it sends the image URL to the FAL.AI SAM-3D API endpoint (`/fal-ai/sam-3/3d-body`), which queues the job and returns a unique `request_id`.\n3.  **Status Polling & Waiting:** The workflow enters a polling loop. It waits 60 seconds, then checks the job's status using the `request_id`. If the status is not \"COMPLETED\", it waits another 60 seconds and checks again.\n4.  **Result Retrieval & Storage:** Once the status is \"COMPLETED\", the workflow fetches the final result, which contains the URL of the generated 3D model file (`.glb`). This file is then downloaded via an HTTP request.\n5.  **Sheet Update:** Finally, the workflow updates the original Google Sheet row. It writes the URL of the generated 3D model into the \"IMAGE RESULT\" column for the corresponding `row_number`, thus marking the task as complete.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo configure this workflow in your n8n environment, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**\n    *   Clone the provided Google Sheet template.\n    *   Insert the URLs of the model images you want to convert into the \"IMAGE MODEL\" column.\n    *   Leave the \"IMAGE RESULT\" column empty; it will be populated automatically.\n    *   In n8n, set up a \"Google Sheets OAuth2 API\" credential and connect it to the **Get new image** and **Update result** nodes. Ensure the `documentId` points to your cloned sheet.\n\n2.  **Configure the FAL.AI API Connection:**\n    *   Create an account at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain your API key.\n    *   In n8n, create an \"HTTP Header Auth\" credential. Set the **Header Name** to `Authorization` and the **Header Value** to `Key YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` (replace with your actual key).\n    *   Apply this credential to the following nodes: **Create 3D Image**, **Get status**, and **Get Url 3D image**.\n\n3.  **Verify Workflow Logic (Key Nodes):**\n    *   **Get new image:** Confirm the `filtersUI` is set to look for empty rows in the correct column (e.g., \"3D RESULT\" or \"IMAGE RESULT\").\n    *   **Create 3D Image:** Verify the JSON body correctly references the image URL from the previous node (`{{ $json.image }}`).\n    *   **Completed? (If node):** Ensure the condition checks for the string `COMPLETED` from `{{ $json.status }}`.\n    *   **Update result:** Double-check that the column mapping correctly uses `row_number` to match the row and updates the \"IMAGE RESULT\" column with the GLB URL \n4.  **Activate & Test:**\n    *   Save the workflow.\n    *   Use the **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node for an initial manual test with one image URL in your sheet.\n    *   Once confirmed working, you can enable the **Schedule Trigger** node for automatic, periodic execution.\n\n---\n\n👉 [Subscribe to my new **YouTube channel**](https://youtube.com/@n3witalia).
