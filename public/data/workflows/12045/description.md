## How it works
Please guys, stop staring at a blank page. This workflow turns viral Instagram trends into original scripts for your channel automatically.

* **Scrapes Trends:** Finds viral reels in your niche using Apify.
* **Transcribes:** Downloads the video and converts the audio to text.
* **Researches:** Uses Perplexity to find facts and add depth to the topic.
* **Writes:** Generates a fresh, unique script based on the viral structure using AI.
* **Saves:** meaningful content directly to your Google Sheet, ready for filming.

## Set up steps
* **Apify:** You need an account to run the Instagram scraper.
* **API Keys:** Have your OpenAI (for writing/transcription) and Perplexity (for research) keys ready.
* **Google Sheet:** Create a sheet with headers for `URL`, `Transcript`, and `Final Script`.
* **Credentials:** Enter your keys into the node credentials in n8n.
* **Test:** Start with a low limit (e.g., 1-2 items) to verify the flow.

## Who is this for?
* **Content Creators:** Beat writer's block and post more consistently.
* **Social Media Managers:** Scale research without hiring a team.
* **Agencies:** Rapidly repurpose trends for multiple clients.
