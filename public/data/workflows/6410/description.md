👤 Who it’s for
Blue teamers, SOC operators, cyber analysts, and SME defenders who want to automatically enrich daily CVE/IOC threats by matching them to their internal asset database.
Ideal for compliance-driven teams (NIST CSF, Essential Eight) seeking automated enrichment and alert routing.

⚙️ How it works / What it does
Loads current threat data from Sheet or Module 1 output

Loads internal asset database from Google Sheets

Merges based on matching IP fields

Calculates impact score (threat score × asset value)

Applies basic playbook logic to classify action

Sends summary emails for matched threats

Logs to archived and live threat monitoring sheets

Built with modular, no-code logic and alerting support

🛠️ How to set up
Google Sheets:
Authenticate your Google account
(OAuth2) and set your Asset DB and Threats log sheet IDs.

Email:
Add sender/recipient addresses and SMTP credentials.

Customize Matching Logic:
Adjust enrichment rule in the “🧠 Match Threats to Assets” node.

Triggers:
Add a Cron node or Webhook to schedule the enrichment job.

Review sticky notes:
All steps are explained clearly within the workflow nodes.

📋 Requirements
Google Sheets with asset inventory + threat log

Google account with Sheets API access

SMTP service (Gmail, Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)

Optional: OpenAI for dynamic playbook scoring (if extending logic)

🧩 How to customize the workflow
Replace Google Sheets with Supabase, Airtable, or Postgres

Extend enrichment rule to include hostname or UUID matching

Fine-tune scoring logic by severity, CVSS, or business unit

Route alerts via Slack, Discord, or n8n Webhook endpoints

Add conditional routing for alert suppression or review queues

📦 No sensitive data included. All credentials and sheet IDs are placeholders.
