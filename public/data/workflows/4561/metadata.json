I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) , a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).\n\nWe use **AI, automation, and data** to support sustainable and data-driven operations across all types of organizations.\n\nThis workflow is part of our networking strategy (as a business) to **track official EU events** that may relate to topics we cover.\n\n[![EU Events Example](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGB2yEPPRk)\n\n\n&gt; Want to stay ahead of critical EU meetings and events without checking the website every day?\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically scrapes the **EU’s official event portal** and logs the latest entries with clean metadata including date, location, category, and link.\n\n📬 For collaborations, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis workflow is useful for:\n- **Policy & public affairs teams** following institutional activities  \n- **Sustainability teams** watching for relevant climate-related summits  \n- **NGOs and researchers** interested in event calendars  \n- **Data teams** building dashboards on public event trends\n\n### What does it do?\n\nThis n8n workflow:\n1. 🌐 Scrapes the **EU events portal** for new meetings and conferences  \n2. 📅 Extracts event metadata (title, date, location, type, and link)  \n3. 🔁 Handles **pagination** across multiple pages  \n4. 🚫 Checks for **duplicates** already stored  \n5. 📊 Saves new records into a connected **Google Sheet**\n\n### How it works\n\n[![EU Event Scraper Workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/image-1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGB2yEPPRk)\n\n\n1. **Triggered daily via cron**\n2. **HTTP node loads the event listing HTML**\n3. **Extract HTML blocks** for each event article\n4. **Parse event name, link, type, location, and full date**\n5. **Concatenate and clean dates** for easy tracking\n6. **Store non-duplicate entries** in Google Sheets\n\nThe workflow uses static data to track pagination and ensure only **new events are stored**, making it ideal for building up a clean dataset over time.\n\n### What do I need to get started?\n\nYou’ll need:\n- A **Google Sheet** connected to your n8n instance  \n- No code or AI tools needed — just n8n and this template\n\n### Follow the Guide!\n\nSticky notes are included directly inside the workflow to guide you step-by-step through setup and customisation.\n\n[![Thumbnail](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-9.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGB2yEPPRk)\n\n![🎥 Watch My Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGB2yEPPRk)\n\n### Notes\n\n- This is ideal for analysts and consultants who want **clean, structured data** from the EU portal  \n- You can add filtering, email alerts, or AI classifiers later\n\n*This workflow was built using n8n version  1.93.0*  \n*Submitted: June 1, 2025*\n",
