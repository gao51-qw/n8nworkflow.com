The **Bug Bounty Target Recon** n8n workflow is a powerful automation tool for security professionals and ethical hackers.

It efficiently automates the time-consuming process of external attack surface mapping.

By taking a domain, the workflow performs DNS Lookups to identify all associated IP addresses, and then utilizes the Shodan API to query:

- Detailed service banners
- Open ports
- Technologies
- Known vulnerabilities

This system delivers crucial, organized OSINT data, saving the user hours of manual scripting and reconnaissance, and providing a clear, actionable map of a target's exposed infrastructure.
