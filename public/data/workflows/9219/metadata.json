Scrape Hiring Signals:** The workflow starts by using an Apify scraper to find companies actively hiring for specific roles on LinkedIn (e.g., “ML Engineer”).\n\n**2. Filter & Qualify Companies:** It automatically filters the results based on your criteria (e.g., company size, industry) to create a high-quality list of target accounts.\n\n**3. Find Decision-Makers:** For each qualified company, it uses Apollo.io to find key decision-makers (VPs, Directors, etc.) and enrich their profiles with verified email addresses using user’s Apollo API.\n\n**4. Build a Lead List:** All the enriched lead data—contact name, title, email, company info—is systematically added to a Google Sheet.\n\n**5. Generate AI-Powered Emails:** The workflow then feeds each lead’s data to a Google Gemini AI model, which drafts a unique, personalized cold email that references the specific job the company is hiring for.\n\n**6. Complete the Outreach List:** Finally, the AI-generated subject line and email body are saved back into the Google Sheet, leaving you with a fully prepared, hyper-targeted outreach campaign.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Apify Configuration:** \n- Connect your Apify account in the Run the LinkedIn Job Scraper node.\n- You’ll need an apify scrapper, we have used [this scrapper](https://apify.com/curious_coder/linkedin-jobs-scraper)\n- In the Custom Body field, paste the URL of your target LinkedIn Jobs search query.\n\n**2. Data Enrichment:**\n- Connect your account API of data providers like Clay, Hunter, Apollo, etc. using HTTP Header Auth in the Get Targeted Personnel and Email Finder nodes.\n\n**3. Google Gemini AI:**\n- Connect your Google Gemini (or PaLM) API account in the Google Gemini Chat Model node.\n\n**4. Google Sheets Setup:**\n- Connect your Google Sheets account.\n- Create a spreadsheet and update the Document ID and Sheet Name in the three Google Sheets nodes to match your own.\n\n**5.
