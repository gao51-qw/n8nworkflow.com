  "title": "Enrich HubSpot companies with Polish CEIDG data using NIP identifiers",
  "description": "This workflow automatically enriches HubSpot company records with official data from the Polish CEIDG (Central Register and Information on Economic Activity) database when a NIP (Polish Tax ID) is added or updated.\n\n## Who's it for\n\nPolish sales teams, marketing agencies, and CRM administrators who work with Polish companies in HubSpot and want to save time on manual data entry while ensuring data accuracy.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Trigger**: Monitors HubSpot for changes to the \"NIP\" property on company records\n2. **Validation**: Checks if the NIP field is not empty\n3. **API Query**: Fetches official company data from the Polish CEIDG database using the provided NIP\n4. **Data Check**: Verifies if company data was successfully retrieved\n5. **Transform**: Maps CEIDG data to HubSpot company properties\n6. **Update**: Enriches the HubSpot company record with:\n   - Company name\n   - Full address (street, city, postal code, state)\n   - Phone number\n   - Website URL\n   - NIP and REGON numbers\n   - Business start date\n7. **Error Handling**: If NIP is invalid or no data found, adds a note to the company record\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **HubSpot account** with:\n  - Custom property \"nip\" created for companies\n  - Custom property \"ceidg_notes\" created for companies (optional, for storing API notes)\n  - App token or developer API credentials\n- **CEIDG API Token** (free registration at https://dane.biznes.gov.pl/)\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Create HubSpot custom properties**:\n   - Go to HubSpot Settings &gt; Properties &gt; Company Properties\n   - Create a \"nip\" property (single-line text)\n   - Create a \"ceidg_notes\" property (multi-line text) for storing API responses\n\n2. **Get CEIDG API Token**:\n   - Register at https://dane.biznes.gov.pl/\n   - Navigate to API section and generate your token\n   - Add token to n8n credentials (HTTP Bearer Auth)\n\n3. **Configure HubSpot credentials**:\n   - Add your HubSpot App Token in n8n credentials\n   - Or use HubSpot Developer API credentials\n\n4. **Activate the workflow**:\n   - Import this workflow to your n8n instance\n   - Configure the credentials in all HubSpot and HTTP nodes\n   - Activate the workflow\n\n5. **Test**:\n   - Add or update a NIP value in any HubSpot company record\n   - Check if the company data gets automatically populated\n\n## How to customize\n\n- **Add more fields**: Modify the \"Transform data for HubSpot\" Code node to map additional CEIDG fields\n- **Change trigger property**: Update the HubSpot Trigger to monitor a different property name\n- **Notification**: Add an email or Slack notification node after successful updates\n- **Batch processing**: Add a schedule trigger to process multiple companies at once\n- **Data validation**: Add nodes to validate NIP format before making the API call\n- **Logging**: Add a Google Sheets or database node to log all enrichment activities\n\n## Notes\n\n- CEIDG database contains data for sole proprietorships registered in Poland\n- For limited liability companies (sp. z o.o.) and other entities, you'll need to use KRS (National Court Register) API instead\n- The workflow processes one company at a time as they are updated\n- API rate limits apply based on your CEIDG API plan",
