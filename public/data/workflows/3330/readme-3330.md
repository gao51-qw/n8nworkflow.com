> ![Screenshot at Mar 26 113716.png](fileId:1062)

# Overview

This n8n workflow is specifically designed to monitor the USDT ERC-20 balance within a specific wallet. It uses Etherscan's public blockchain database, which does not require API authentication, to periodically check and process transaction data. This workflow is ideal for users who need an automated solution to track ERC-20 wallet transactions.

# Features
- **Automatic Monitoring**: Executes every 5 minutes to capture new transactions.
- **Customizable Filters**: Customize tracking based on parameters like transaction duration and wallet addresses.
- **Data Aggregation**: Compiles transaction data into a single, structured list.
- **Formatted Outputs**: Presents processed data in an organized format.
- **Telegram Tracking**: Tracks wallet balances via Telegram notifications using the bot.

# Requirements
- **n8n Setup**: Requires a self-hosted or cloud-based n8n instance.
- **Basic Understanding**: Basic knowledge of n8n workflows and nodes.

# Installation and Configuration

# How It Works

2. **Edit Fields**: Sets the wallet address, Etherscan API key, and USDT ERC-20 token address.
3. **Edit Telegram Settings**: Create a bot via BotFather. Configure the API key and Telegram Chat ID.
4. **Etherscan Data Import**: Collects transaction data from the ERC-20 wallet using Etherscan's public database.
5. **Final Results**: Organizes and formats the transaction data for review.
6. **Telegram Bot Message Sending**: If there is a balance change, it sends a formatted message about the balance change. If there is no balance change, it sends a message that your balance has not changed. You can configure it to avoid sending a message when there is no change.
