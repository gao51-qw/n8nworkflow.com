# Generate videos from text or images with Sora 2 AI - no watermark

> ## Sora 2 Video Generator - No Watermark (Minimal Setup)

### This n8n workflow enables you to generate professional AI videos using OpenAI's Sora 2 without watermarks. Create videos from text descriptions or animate your images with a simple web form interface - ready to use in just 5 minutes!

Generate cinematic AI videos for social media, marketing campaigns, product demos, or creative projects. The workflow handles both text-to-video and image-to-video generation with automatic status polling until your video is ready.

**Good to know:**

• Kie.AI charges per video generation. Check their pricing page for current rates
• Videos typically take 30-60 seconds for standard quality, 60-120 seconds for HD
• The workflow automatically retries status checks every 30 seconds until completion
• No watermarks on output videos

### How it works

• Users submit video requests via a beautiful web form with description, aspect ratio, and quality options
• The workflow detects if an image was uploaded and routes to either text-to-video or image-to-video 
• For image uploads, the file is automatically uploaded to ImgBB to generate a public URL
• The request is sent to Sora 2 API via Kie.AI with your specifications (prompt, quality, aspect ratio)
• The workflow waits 30 seconds, then checks if video generation is complete
• If not ready, it automatically loops back and checks again every 30 seconds
• Once complete, the video is downloaded and optionally sent via Telegram notification
• Clean, watermark-free MP4 video output ready for use
