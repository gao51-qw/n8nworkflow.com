  "description": "## Who is this for?\nThis workflow is for service-based businesses and freelancers who want to automate booking appointments via WhatsApp without relying on third-party scheduling tools. It's perfect for small teams who want full control over the reservation system and calendar integration.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\nManually coordinating bookings through messages can be inefficient and error-prone. This workflow streamlines the entire scheduling process-from user input to calendar event creation-saving time and avoiding double-bookings. It ensures users only choose from available time slots and automatically records the meeting in your Google Calendar.\n\n## What this workflow does\n- Sends a WhatsApp message with a reservation link.\n- Collects the user's name and preferred date.\n- Checks availability and shows only free time slots.\n- Allows the user to choose a time slot.\n- Automatically creates a Google Calendar event with the selected details.\n- Saves all data to a Postgres database for future reference.\n\n## Setup\n1. Create Tables in Postgres DB\n   - Open the provided SQL script and replace \"n8n\" with your Postgres schema name.\n   - Execute the script to create the required tables.\n2. Add Credentials\n   - WhatsApp: Set up your WhatsApp Business API credentials using OAuth and API keys.\n   - Postgres: Connect your database where the booking data will be stored.\n   - Google Calendar: Authorize access to your calendar for event creation.",
