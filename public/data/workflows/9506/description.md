# Duplicate Submission Detection & Auto Response for Jotform

## Who's it for

Form managers, SaaS platforms, event organizers, recruitment teams, and any organization using Jotform who need automatic duplicate prevention with intelligent, personalized email responses without manual intervention.

## What it does

This workflow automatically detects duplicate form submissions by email address, prevents duplicate entries in your database, and triggers intelligent email responses. When a new submission arrives, the system checks against all previous submissions. If a match is found, it deletes the duplicate and sends a friendly notification. If it's a new submission, it sends a professional welcome confirmation.

The entire process happens in seconds with no manual work required. AI-generated emails adapt to your form type and industry, making responses feel personalized and relevant.

## How it works

**Step-by-step:**
1. Form submission triggers the workflow
2. System extracts email and contact information
3. Fetches all previous submissions from Jotform
4. Filters for active submissions matching the email
5. Counts matching submissions to determine if duplicate
6. If duplicate: Deletes the submission, generates rejection email, sends to submitter
7. If new: Generates welcome confirmation email, sends to submitter
