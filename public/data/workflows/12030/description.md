## How It Works
This workflow automates monthly tax processing by ingesting expense receipts alongside revenue data, extracting structured deduction details using GPT-4, and accurately matching expenses to their corresponding revenue periods. It retrieves receipts with built-in type validation, parses deduction information through OpenAI structured output extraction, and consolidates revenue records into a unified dataset. The system then intelligently aligns expenses with revenue timelines, calculates eligible deductions, and generates well-formatted tax reports that are automatically sent to designated agents via Gmail. Designed for accountants, tax professionals, and finance teams, it enables automated expense categorization and optimized deduction calculations.

1. Configure receipt storage source and OpenAI Chat Model API key.
