  "description": "## How It Works\nThis workflow automates monthly tax processing by ingesting expense receipts alongside revenue data, extracting structured deduction details using GPT-4, and accurately matching expenses to their corresponding revenue periods. It retrieves receipts with built-in type validation, parses deduction information through OpenAI structured output extraction, and consolidates revenue records into a unified dataset. The system then intelligently aligns expenses with revenue timelines, calculates eligible deductions, and generates well-formatted tax reports that are automatically sent to designated agents via Gmail. Designed for accountants, tax professionals, and finance teams, it enables automated expense categorization and optimized deduction calculations.\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. Configure receipt storage source and OpenAI Chat Model API key.\n2. Connect Gmail for report delivery and set up tax agent email.\n3.
