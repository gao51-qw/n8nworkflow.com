  "description": "## How it works  \nThis workflow automatically identifies users who started but did not complete the signup process. It runs on a fixed schedule, checks your database for inactive and incomplete users, and validates the results before proceeding. Each user is then processed individually to send a personalized recovery email and enroll them in a follow-up sequence. Finally, the workflow updates the database to avoid duplicate outreach and notifies the sales team in Slack.\n\n## Step-by-step  \n- **Step 1: Run scheduled check and identify abandoned users**  \n  - **Schedule Trigger** – Executes the workflow automatically every 24 hours.  \n  - **Find Abandoned Users** – Queries Postgres for users marked as incomplete and inactive for over 24 hours.  \n  - **If** – Confirms that valid user records exist before continuing.  \n\n- **Step 2: Process users and send recovery emails**  \n  - **Loop Over Items** – Processes users one at a time to avoid rate limits and execution errors.  \n  - **PrepareEmail email** – Generates a personalized recovery email using a predefined template.  \n  - **Send a message** – Sends the recovery email through Gmail.  \n  - **Get a message** – Retrieves the sent email details for tracking and thread reference.  \n  - **StartSequence email** – Adds the email to a follow-up sequence for engagement tracking.  \n\n- **Step 3: Update records and notify the team**  \n  - **Update rows in a table** – Marks the user as contacted to prevent duplicate recovery emails.  \n  - **Alert Sales Team** – Sends a Slack notification with user details and recovery status.  \n\n## Why use this?  \n- Recover users who abandon onboarding without manual follow-ups  \n- Ensure each user receives only one recovery email  \n- Keep your Postgres user data accurate and up to date  \n- Provide sales teams with real-time visibility via Slack alerts  \n- Improve signup completion and activation rates automatically  \n",
