## How It Works
This workflow automates insurance premium adjustments by analyzing telematics data with AI-driven risk assessment and syncing changes across underwriting systems. Designed for carriers, actuaries, and underwriting teams managing usage-based insurance programs, it eliminates manual review of driving patterns, speed, braking, and mileage while ensuring compliance. Scheduled execution fetches telematics data via HTTP from vehicles or mobile apps. Anthropic Claude analyzes behavior with structured output parsing, generating risk scores from acceleration, harsh braking, speeding, and time-of-day driving. Calculator node applies scores to premiums, and HTTP node updates policy systems. High-risk cases trigger Gmail alerts to underwriting managers and Slack notifications to claims teams. Final HTTP sync ensures compliance across all systems.

## Setup Steps
1. Configure Schedule node for desired analysis frequency 
2. Set up HTTP node with telematics platform API  
3. Add Anthropic API key to Chat Model node for behavioral risk analysis
4. Connect policy management system API credentials in HTTP nodes 
5. Integrate Gmail and Slack with underwriting team addresses
