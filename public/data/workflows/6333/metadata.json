  "description": "## 🚫 Email Unsubscribe Handler for Outlook \n\n## Description\nThis n8n workflow automatically scans recent email replies from your Outlook inbox and identifies unsubscribe requests. If a contact replies with any variation of \"unsubscribe\" within the past 7 days, the system performs two key actions:\n\nSaves the contact’s email address in a BigQuery unsubscribes table (for compliance and tracking).\n\nDeletes that contact from the active leads table in BigQuery (to stop future outreach).\n\nThis flow can be triggered on a schedule (e.g. every 4 hours) or run manually as needed.\n\n## Key Features\n📥 Email Parsing from Outlook: Automatically monitors for replies that contain unsubscribe language.\n\n🧠 Smart Filtering: Captures unsubscribes based on message content, not just subject lines.\n\n🔄 BigQuery Integration: Logs unsubscribed emails and removes them from your leads dataset.\n\n## 🤝 Connect with Me\n\n## Description  \nI’m Robert Breen, founder of Ynteractive — a consulting firm that helps businesses automate operations using **n8n**, **AI agents**, and custom workflows.
