## 🚫 Email Unsubscribe Handler for Outlook 

## Description
This n8n workflow automatically scans recent email replies from your Outlook inbox and identifies unsubscribe requests. If a contact replies with any variation of "unsubscribe" within the past 7 days, the system performs two key actions:

Saves the contact’s email address in a BigQuery unsubscribes table (for compliance and tracking).

Deletes that contact from the active leads table in BigQuery (to stop future outreach).

This flow can be triggered on a schedule (e.g. every 4 hours) or run manually as needed.

## Key Features
📥 Email Parsing from Outlook: Automatically monitors for replies that contain unsubscribe language.

🧠 Smart Filtering: Captures unsubscribes based on message content, not just subject lines.

🔄 BigQuery Integration: Logs unsubscribed emails and removes them from your leads dataset.
