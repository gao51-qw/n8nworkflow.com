# OpenAI models template: GPT-4 and DALL-E services overview

> # Complete AI Graphic Design Suite with OpenAI, Replicate & Google Drive

**Categories:** AI Agents, Design Automation, Business Tools

This workflow creates a complete AI-powered graphic design system that replaces expensive designers with intelligent automation. Featuring a conversational AI agent that orchestrates 5 specialized design tools, this suite can generate logos, style guides, gradients, and revisions on demand.

- Seamlessly integrates with all design generation tools
- Perfect for high-resolution marketing materials and presentations

## **Required Setup Configuration**

**OpenAI API Setup:**
Connect your OpenAI API for:
- GPT-4 conversation handling and design guidance
- DALL-E (4o) image generation for all design tools
- Intelligent prompt processing and tool selection

**Google Drive Integration:**
- Create template files for style guides and examples
- Set up OAuth credentials for file management
- Configure sharing permissions for client access
- Organize folders for different design categories

**Replicate API Configuration:**
- Set up account for image upscaling capabilities
- Replace `&lt;your-replicate-api-key-here&gt;` with actual API key
- Configure upscaling factors (2x or 4x options)

**AI Agent System Message:**
Configure the agent with business context:

You are a helpful, intelligent design assistant. You generate high-quality designs using the provided tools (generate logo, generate style guide, and generate gradient background). Then you can also upscale them, and finally, you can revise them.
When you receive an image from a tool, wrap it in nice looking Markdown (atx) format and present it to the user.
The only things you can generate are logos, style guides, and gradient backgrounds.
Make sure to clarify which (as well as any additional information needed) so the prompt you send to the image model is optimal.
If you are asked to adjust or revise an image, ask the user to define their changes as explicitly as possible.

**Chat Integration Options:**
- Embedded website chat widget for client-facing design services
- Direct chat interface for internal team use
- Hosted chat endpoint for external integrations

## **Business Use Cases**

- **Scalable white-label solution** for agencies and consultants
- **24/7 availability** for time-sensitive client requests

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate  
**Estimated Build Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Monthly Operating Cost:** ~$30 (OpenAI + Replicate APIs)
