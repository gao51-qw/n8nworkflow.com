## 📊 Description
Streamline customer support with a real-time, AI-powered answer engine that detects incoming support emails, classifies intent, identifies the customer’s GEO region, and generates a tailored reply ready to send. 📧

🤖 This workflow intelligently adjusts tone and clarity based on region (US, UK, India, Canada, Australia, etc.) and ensures every outgoing message is structured, compliant, and highly contextual. Valid queries receive an automated reply via Gmail and a Slack summary, while non-support messages are flagged for manual review. A perfect automation for scaling support operations with precision and personalization. 🌍⚡
