### Who this is for?
The Automate Etsy Data Mining with Bright Data Scrape & Google Gemini workflow is designed for eCommerce analysts, product researchers, and AI developers seeking to extract actionable insights from Etsy listings at scale. 

It is ideal for:

- **eCommerce Entrepreneurs** - Researching product demand and competition.

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Manually browsing Etsy to analyze product listings, pricing, reviews, and seller activity is slow, inconsistent, and unscalable. Scraping Etsy requires unlocking JavaScript-heavy content and structuring noisy data for analysis.

This workflow solves:

- Automated and scalable scraping of Etsy product listings using Bright Data’s infrastructure.

- A fully paginated data structured Estry production data extraction via the Google Gemini LLM.

- Enables faster decision-making for product research and competitive analysis via the fully automated paginated data extraction.

### What this workflow does

- Receives input: Sets the Esty URL for the data extraction and analysis.

- Uses Bright Data's Web Unlocker to extract content from relevant sites.

- Cleans and preprocesses the scraped content for readability.

- Sends the content to Google Gemini for:

	- Enriched results including:

		- Data persistence over the disk.

		- Sends the response to a target system via Webhook notification.
