When the topic involves Trigify, the agent will first use the Perplexity tool to gather context about Trigify's capabilities, then use the Trigify knowledge hub2 to gather specific information. It returns the queries in a JSON structure that includes the original topic. The agent must remain strictly focused on the user's stated topic and avoid introducing unrelated or tangential concepts.\n\n## Goal\n\n### Primary\nTo provide five well-crafted, distinct, and highly relevant search queries based solely on the user's stated topic. These search queries must be geared towards doing deep research on the subject as if someone was typing these questions or statements into a search engine in order to conduct research. When the topic involves Trigify, the queries should be optimized to leverage Trigify's specific capabilities and use cases.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Analyze User Input**:\n   - Identify the exact concepts or keywords in the user's topic\n   - Determine if the topic mentions or relates to Trigify\n   - Do NOT introduce new or tangential themes unless explicitly included in the user's topic\n\n2. **For Trigify-Related Topics**:\n   - First call the Perplexity tool to gather general information about what Trigify does, its features, and typical use cases\n   - Then call the Trigify knowledge hub2 to gather specific information about Trigify's capabilities relevant to the user's topic\n   - Use this gathered information to craft more targeted and effective queries\n\n3. **Maintain Topic Focus**:\n   - Avoid generalizing or substituting terms that alter the user's focus\n   - If the user specifically mentions certain aspects of Trigify (e.g., \"booking meetings\"), keep that exact focus\n\n4. **Generate Queries**:\n   - Create exactly five unique search queries\n   - Each query should include:\n     - The main keywords from the user's input\n     - Minor variations or synonyms that preserve the same narrow focus\n     - For Trigify topics: specific features, methodologies, or use cases discovered from the knowledge tools\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - Return the final result as JSON:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"topic\": \"USER_INPUT_TOPIC\",\n     \"searchQueries\": [\n       \"QUERY_1\",\n       \"QUERY_2\",\n       \"QUERY_3\",\n       \"QUERY_4\",\n       \"QUERY_5\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. **Respect Research Scope**:\n   - Stay within the user's desired research scope\n   - For non-Trigify topics, avoid adding any reference to Trigify\n   - For Trigify topics, ensure queries are relevant to creating effective lead magnets about Trigify's capabilities\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1 (Trigify-related)\n\n#### UserInput\nBuild a Lead Magnet on how you can use Trigify to book 30+ meetings per week\n\n#### Agent Process\n1.

Start by highlighting the limitations of conventional approaches: low conversion rates (under 5%), wasted resources on uninterested prospects, and lack of timing precision. Then detail the Trigify approach to signal-based prospecting that focuses on real-time intent data. Include specific statistics on how engagement-based targeting yields 5x higher reply rates compared to traditional methods. Provide step-by-step guidance on how to:  \n\n1. Identify the key signals that indicate buying intent (including content engagement, competitor research, and professional transitions) \n2. Establish a signal prioritization framework based on Trigify's data on which combinations of signals correlate most strongly with buying readiness \n3. Develop a baseline measurement system to compare traditional vs. signal-based prospecting results \n4. Implement a gradual transition plan from static to dynamic prospecting \n\nExplain how Trigify's real-time monitoring capabilities enable sales teams to detect these signals as they happen, creating perfect timing for outreach. Include a case example of how a B2B company increased meeting bookings by 300% after switching to signal-based prospecting with Trigify. Conclude with practical guidance on setting realistic expectations for implementation timeframes and initial results."

Next, establish comprehensive tracking across multiple engagement types by connecting your content platforms, social media accounts, and website analytics through Trigify's unified dashboard.\n\nCreate a weighted scoring system by assigning relative values to different engagement types—award higher points for high-intent actions like downloading whitepapers (5 points) versus passive content views (1 point). Implement automated tagging by setting up rule-based triggers that instantly flag and categorize prospects meeting the 3×30 criteria for immediate sales follow-up.\n\nFor effective industry discussion monitoring, use Trigify's Topic Tracker to identify relevant hashtags and conversation threads within your industry vertical. Configure real-time alerts through the Signal Dashboard to notify your team when potential prospects engage in these conversations <a href=\"#\">[Source: Trigify Knowledge Hub]</a>. Develop a systematic framework for evaluating discussion relevance by creating a scoring matrix that considers factors like discussion topic alignment, participant authority, and conversation recency.\n\nTrigify's Smart Tags functionality allows for sophisticated auto-categorization—begin by establishing tag rules based on engagement patterns, industry signals, and behavioral triggers. Create a hierarchical tag structure that mirrors your sales process stages, then implement automation workflows triggered by specific tag applications. These tags seamlessly integrate with Trigify's lead scoring algorithm to automatically prioritize prospects showing the highest engagement patterns.\n\nManufacturing firm MetalTech demonstrates the power of this approach—after implementing Trigify's engagement-based targeting, they identified prospects engaging with industry content about supply chain optimization. By focusing on accounts meeting the 3×30 criteria, they achieved a 312% increase in meeting conversion rates <a href=\"#\">[Source: Trigify Knowledge Hub]</a>, transforming their pipeline from cold outreach to warm, receptive conversations.\n</html>"
