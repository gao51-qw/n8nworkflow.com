### How it works
![Screenshot 20250218 085635.jpg](fileId:954)
There are two methods to determine your available balance, depending on your account's billing setup.

This template gives you both methods, so you can choose the one that best fits your situation.

You can also replace the Telegram node with another chat app, like **WhatsApp**, Slack, Discord, Twilio or even Email.

### Who is this template for?

Marketing professionals who want to automate low balance notifications, so they don’t have to check their balance all the time.

### How to set up

All information you need to set up this workflow is already inside the template.
