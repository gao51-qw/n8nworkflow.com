  "description": "### This workflow automates personalized cold email outreach by pulling lead data from a Google Sheet, sending emails via Gmail, and updating the sheet to track who has been contacted.\n\n## Features\n- **Automated Scheduling** – Runs daily at a specified hour via the **Schedule Trigger** node.\n- **Google Sheets Integration** – Fetches leads whose `\"Is Email Sent\"` value is empty.\n- **Batch Processing** – Processes leads in manageable batches.\n- **Personalized Gmail Outreach** – Sends custom emails using a pre-written template.\n- **Status Tracking** – Updates each lead’s row after an email is sent to prevent duplicates.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials**\n- **Gmail account with OAuth2**\n- Access to n8n with a deployed instance\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Connect Accounts\n\nAuthenticate **Google Sheets** and **Gmail** nodes via OAuth2 in your n8n credentials settings.\n\n### 2. Prepare Your Google Sheet\n\nYour Google Sheet must contain the following columns:\n\n```\n\nEmail\nName (or WF Full Name (metadata))\nIs Email Sent\n\n````\n\n#### Example:\n\n| Email               | Name          | Is Email Sent |\n|--------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| test@example.com   | John Doe      |                |\n| jane@company.com   | Jane Smith    | yes            |\n\nOnly rows where `\"Is Email Sent\"` is **not** marked as `\"yes\"` will be processed.\n\n### 3. Customize the Email Template\n\nOpen the **“Send Personalized Email”** node and update the `message` field. You can use variables like:\n\n```handlebars\n{{ $json.Name }}\n{{ $json['WF Full Name (metadata)'] }}\n````\n\n#### Example Message:\n\n```text\nHello {{ $json.Name || $json['WF Full Name (metadata)'] }},\n\nI’m a software developer and automation expert. I work with businesses and individuals to build websites, mobile apps, and powerful digital solutions that help save time and grow online.\n\nI offer a range of services including:\n- Website & App Development\n- SEO & Digital Marketing\n- Business Process Automation\n\nIf you’re looking to start a new project or improve your current setup, I’d love to connect and see how I can help.\n\nAre you interested in discussing any of these services?\n\nBest regards,  \nSoftware Developer | Automation Expert\n```\n\n### 4. Schedule the Workflow\n\nEdit the **Schedule Trigger** node to your preferred time (currently set to 2 PM daily):\n\n\n---\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n* Replace the email copy with your branding or offer.\n* Add more fields (like company or industry) and update the message for deeper personalization.\n* Modify the batch size in the **Split In Batches** node for rate control.\n\n---\n\n## Notes & Limitations\n\n* **Gmail Quotas:** Gmail has sending limits (e.g., 500 emails/day for free accounts).\n* **OAuth2 Scope Approval:** Ensure the necessary scopes (e.g., Gmail send and Sheets read/write) are granted.\n* **Rate Limiting:** If working with large lists, consider time delays or throttle controls.\n\n---\n\n## Google Sheet Template\n\nYou can [make a copy of this sample Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qKwg2L7EUFF5idMMNxywX3Y3Iv7oW0hm6qoF3yzQluM/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.\n\n---\n",
