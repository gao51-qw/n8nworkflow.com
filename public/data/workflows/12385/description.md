## How It Works
This workflow automates financial oversight for accounting teams, tax professionals, and financial controllers managing monthly transaction volumes. It solves the challenge of identifying and correcting revenue discrepancies, tax calculation errors, and unusual patterns that manual review often misses. The system collects monthly financial transactions via scheduled trigger, then fetches complete transaction data through API integration. An AI anomaly detection agent analyzes patterns using multiple specialized tools: an OpenAI model identifies statistical outliers and unusual behaviors, a calculator validates mathematical accuracy of revenue entries, and a historical pattern analyzer compares against baseline trends. Detected anomalies undergo verification by a secondary AI agent to eliminate false positives. Confirmed issues route to automated revenue adjustments and tax agent notifications, while alert emails provide detailed anomaly reports with recommended actions, ensuring financial accuracy and compliance.

## Setup Steps
1. Configure OpenAI API credentials in "Anomaly Detection Agent"
2. Set up financial data source API connection in "Fetch Financial Transactions" node with authentication
3. Define anomaly detection thresholds and rules in AI agent tool configurations
4. Configure tax system integration credentials in "Update Revenue Entries" 
5. Set up email notification service with recipient lists in "Send Anomaly Alert" node

OpenAI API access, financial system API credentials with read/write permissions.
## Use Cases
Monthly financial close automation, revenue recognition validation
## Customization
Modify anomaly detection algorithms for industry-specific patterns
## Benefits
