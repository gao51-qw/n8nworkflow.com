  "description": "## 📘 Overview\nThis workflow automates **end-to-end social media publishing** powered by **Late API**.  \nIt generates text content with **Google Gemini**, creates branded visuals with **Kie.ai**, uploads media to **Late**, and publishes across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).  \n\nIt’s a production-ready automation for marketing teams who want to save hours of work by letting AI handle both copywriting and design — all inside n8n.\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n1. **Generate text content** → Google Gemini produces platform-optimized copy (tone & length adapted to each network).  \n2. **Generate visuals** → Kie.ai Seedream v4 creates branded 1080x1080 images.  \n3. **Upload to Late** → media is stored using Late’s upload API (small & large file handling).  \n4. **Publish** → posts are created via Late API on enabled platforms with correct `{ platform, accountId }` mapping.  \n5. **Notify** → success logs are sent via Slack, Discord, Email, and Webhook.  \n\n## 🛠 Setup Steps\n- **Time to setup:** ~10–15 minutes  \n- **Steps:**\n  1. Add your **API keys** in n8n Credentials:\n     - Google Gemini API (PaLM)\n     - Kie.ai (Seedream)\n     - Late API\n  2. Insert your **Account IDs** (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) into the **Default Settings** node.\n  3. Choose which platforms to enable (`ENABLE_FACEBOOK`, `ENABLE_INSTAGRAM`, etc.).\n  4. Set your **Business Type** and **Content Topic** (e.g., “a tech company” / “new product launch”).\n  5. Execute the workflow.  \n\n## 📝 Notes\n- **Sticky Notes** are included in the workflow to guide each section: Overview, Prerequisites, Default Settings, Content Generation, Image Generation, Media Upload, Publishing Logic, Notifications, Error Handling.  \n- All API keys are handled via **Credentials** (no hardcoding).  \n- Fallback content is included in case Gemini fails to parse.  \n- Large image files (&gt;4MB) are handled with Late’s multipart upload flow.  \n\n## 💸 Cost per Flow (Estimated)\n- **Late API**: $0.00 within Free/Unlimited plans, or ≈ $0.11/post on Build plan ($13/120 posts).  \n- **Google Gemini**: ~$0.0001–$0.0004 per post (≈200 tokens in/out).  \n- **Kie.ai (Seedream)**: ≈ $0.01–$0.02 per generated image.  \n\n➡️ **Total: ~$0.01 – $0.12 per post**, depending mainly on your Late plan & Kie.ai credits.\n\n## 🎯 Use cases\n- Marketing teams automating cross-platform campaigns.  \n- Solo founders posting content daily without design/copy effort.  \n- Agencies scaling social media management with AI + automation.  \n\n## 📢 Credits\n- Built by **Adrian (RoboMarketing)** for the **n8n Arena Challenge – September 2025**.  \n- Powered by:\n  - [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started)  \n  - [Kie.ai Seedream](https://kie.ai/seedream-api)  \n  - [Late API](https://getlate.dev/docs)",
