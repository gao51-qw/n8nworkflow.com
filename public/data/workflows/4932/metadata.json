  "description": "This minimal utility workflow connects to the SAP Business One Service Layer API to verify login credentials and return the session ID. It's ideal for testing access or using as a sub-workflow to retrieve the B1SESSION token for other operations.\n\n**++⚙️ HOW IT WORKS:++**\n**🔹 1. Trigger Manually**\n\nThe workflow is initiated using a Manual Trigger.\n\nIdeal for testing or debugging credentials before automation.\n\n**🔹 2. Set SAP Login Data**\n\nThe Set Login Data node defines four key input variables:\n\nsap_url: Base URL of the SAP B1 Service Layer (e.g. https://sap-server:50000/b1s/v1/)\n\nsap_username: SAP B1 username\n\nsap_password: SAP B1 password\n\nsap_companydb: SAP B1 Company DB name\n\n**🔹 3. Connect to SAP**\n\nA HTTP Request node performs a POST to the Login endpoint.\n\nThe body is structured as:\n\n{\n  \"UserName\": \"your_sap_username\",\n  \"Password\": \"your_sap_password\",\n  \"CompanyDB\": \"your_sap_companydb\"\n}\n\nIf successful, the response contains a SessionId which is essential for authenticated requests.\n\n**🔹 4. Return Session or Error**\n\nThe response is branched:\n\nOn success → the sessionID is extracted and returned.\n\nOn failure → the error message and status code are stored separately.\n\n**++🛠 SETUP STEPS:++**\n**1️⃣ Create SAP Service Layer Credentials**\nAlthough this workflow uses manual inputs (via Set), it's best to define your connection details as environment variables for reuse:\n\nSAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:50000/b1s/v1/\nSAP_USER=your_sapuser\nSAP_PASSWORD=your_password\nSAP_COMPANY_DB=your_companyDB\n\nAlternatively, update the Set Login Data node directly with your values.\n\n**2️⃣ Run the Workflow**\nClick \"Execute Workflow\" in n8n.\n\nWatch the response from SAP:\n\nIf successful: sessionID will be available in the Success node.\n\nIf failed: statusCode and errorMessage will be available in the Failed node.\n\n**++✅ USE CASES:++**\n- 🔄 Reusable Login Module\nExport this as a reusable sub-workflow for other SAP-integrated flows.\n\n- 🔐 Credential Testing Tool\nValidate new environments, test credentials before deployment.",
