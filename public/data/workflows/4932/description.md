This minimal utility workflow connects to the SAP Business One Service Layer API to verify login credentials and return the session ID. It's ideal for testing access or using as a sub-workflow to retrieve the B1SESSION token for other operations.

**++⚙️ HOW IT WORKS:++**
**🔹 1. Trigger Manually**

The workflow is initiated using a Manual Trigger.

Ideal for testing or debugging credentials before automation.

**🔹 2. Set SAP Login Data**

The Set Login Data node defines four key input variables:

sap_url: Base URL of the SAP B1 Service Layer (e.g. https://sap-server:50000/b1s/v1/)

sap_username: SAP B1 username

sap_password: SAP B1 password

sap_companydb: SAP B1 Company DB name

**🔹 3. Connect to SAP**

A HTTP Request node performs a POST to the Login endpoint.

The body is structured as:

{
  "UserName": "your_sap_username",
  "Password": "your_sap_password",
  "CompanyDB": "your_sap_companydb"
}

If successful, the response contains a SessionId which is essential for authenticated requests.

**🔹 4. Return Session or Error**

The response is branched:

On success → the sessionID is extracted and returned.

On failure → the error message and status code are stored separately.

**++🛠 SETUP STEPS:++**
**1️⃣ Create SAP Service Layer Credentials**
Although this workflow uses manual inputs (via Set), it's best to define your connection details as environment variables for reuse:

SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:50000/b1s/v1/
SAP_USER=your_sapuser
SAP_PASSWORD=your_password
SAP_COMPANY_DB=your_companyDB

Alternatively, update the Set Login Data node directly with your values.

**2️⃣ Run the Workflow**
Click "Execute Workflow" in n8n.

Watch the response from SAP:

If successful: sessionID will be available in the Success node.

If failed: statusCode and errorMessage will be available in the Failed node.

**++✅ USE CASES:++**
- 🔄 Reusable Login Module
Export this as a reusable sub-workflow for other SAP-integrated flows.

- 🔐 Credential Testing Tool
Validate new environments, test credentials before deployment.
