  "description": "## Overview\nThis n8n template tracks **GitHub Trending repositories** (daily/weekly/monthly), parses the trending page into structured data (rank, repo name, stars, language, etc.), and stores results in **Google Sheets** with **automatic deduping**. It’s designed for teams who want a simple “trending feed” for engineering research, developer tooling discovery, and weekly reporting.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- Developers, PMs, DevRel, and tooling teams who want a lightweight trend radar\n- Anyone building a curated list of fast-rising open source projects\n- Teams who want Sheets-based tracking without manual copy/paste\n\n## What problems it solves\n- Automatically collects GitHub Trending data on a schedule\n- Prevents duplicate rows using a stable `dedupe_key`\n- Updates existing rows when values change (rank/stars/score)\n\n## How it works\n1. A schedule triggers the workflow.\n2. Inputs define the trending window (`daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`) and optional languages.\n3. ScrapeOps fetches the GitHub Trending HTML reliably.\n4. The workflow parses repositories and ranks from the HTML.\n5. Cleaned rows are written to Google Sheets using **Append or Update Row** matching on `dedupe_key`.\n\n## Setup steps (~5–10 minutes)\n1) **ScrapeOps**\n- Register & get an API key: [https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n)\n- Read the n8n overview: [https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/overview/](https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/overview/)\n- (Optional) Learn ScrapeOps Proxy API features: [https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/proxy-api/](https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/proxy-api/)\n\n2) **Google Sheets**\n- [Duplicate this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GhCbbPilZXMVDox0hQ0Ncqf5-g3AdFFy55Ld30gPD-E/edit?gid=0#gid=0)/create a Sheet and add a `trending_raw` tab.\n- Add columns used by the workflow (e.g. captured_at, since, source_url, rank_on_page, full_name, repo_url, stars_total, forks_total, stars_in_period, score, dedupe_key).\n- In the Google Sheets node, choose **Append or Update Row** and set **Column to match on = dedupe_key**.\n\n3) **Customize**\n- Change `since` to daily/weekly/monthly in the Inputs node.\n- Add languages via `languages_csv` (example: `any,python,go,rust`).\n- Adjust delay if needed.\n\n## Pre-conditions\n- ScrapeOps account + API key configured in n8n\n- Google Sheets credentials connected in n8n\n- A Sheet tab named `trending_raw` with matching columns\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis template uses **ScrapeOps as a community node**. You are responsible for complying with GitHub’s Terms of Service, robots directives, and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Scraping targets can change at any time; you may need to update wait times and parsing logic accordingly. Use responsibly for legitimate business purposes.\n",
