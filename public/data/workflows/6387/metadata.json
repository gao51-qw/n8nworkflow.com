  "description": "## How it works\n\nYour WhatsApp AI Assistant automatically handles customer inquiries by linking your Google Docs knowledge base to incoming WhatsApp messages. The system instantly processes customer questions, references your business documentation, and delivers AI-powered responses through OpenAI or Gemini - all without you lifting a finger. Works seamlessly in individual chats and WhatsApp groups where the assistant can respond on your behalf.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Time to complete: 15-30 minutes**\n\n**Step 1:** Create your WhapAround account and connect your WhatsApp number (5 minutes)\n\n**Step 2:** Prepare your Google Doc with business information and add the document ID to the system (5 minutes)\n\n**Step 3:** Configure the WhatsApp webhook and map message fields (10 minutes)\n\n**Step 4:** Connect your OpenAI or Gemini API key (3 minutes)\n\n**Step 5:** Send a test message to verify everything works (2 minutes)\n\n**Optional:** Set up PostgreSQL database for conversation memory and configure custom branding/escalation rules (additional 15-20 minutes)\n\n*Detailed technical configurations, webhook URLs, and API parameter settings are provided within each workflow step to guide you through the exact setup process.*",
