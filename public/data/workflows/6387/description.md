## How it works

Your WhatsApp AI Assistant automatically handles customer inquiries by linking your Google Docs knowledge base to incoming WhatsApp messages. The system instantly processes customer questions, references your business documentation, and delivers AI-powered responses through OpenAI or Gemini - all without you lifting a finger. Works seamlessly in individual chats and WhatsApp groups where the assistant can respond on your behalf.
