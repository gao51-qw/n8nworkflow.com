This node serves as the entry point to the full automation.\n\n### 🔹 Field Mapping & Pre-Processing\nA series of basic logic nodes map and clean up the input fields. These are then passed to an **LLM Chain** to generate specific questions related to the job description.\n\n### 🔹 Question Answer Chain + Vector Search (Pinecone)\nUsing your previously stored skills and project data in a **Pinecone vector store**, the system retrieves relevant information to answer the generated questions and builds a rich context around the job description.\n\n### 🔹 AI Agent Node – Generate Personalized Cover Letter\nWith both the job post and contextual data, the **AI Agent** (powered by **Groq’s Qwen LLM**) creates a tailored cover letter.  \nThe agent is equipped with:\n\n- 🔍 Google Search Tool  \n- 🧠 Vector Store Retriever Tool  \n- 🗃️ Buffer Memory  \n\nThis ensures the generated proposal is **insightful**, **relevant**, and **professional**.\n\n### 🔹 Markdown to HTML – Clean Output Conversion\nThe markdown output from the AI is converted into **HTML** using a **Markdown node**, making it easy to paste directly into Upwork or emails.\n\n### 🔹 Return to Shortcut – Display Final Result\nThe final HTML response is sent back to the **MacOS Shortcut**, which displays it in a **modal window** for easy review and copy-paste.\n\n---\n\n## 💼 Use Case\n\nThis automation is built specifically for freelancers on **Upwork** (or any freelance platform) who want to:\n\n- ✅ Save time on repetitive proposal writing  \n- ✅ Create job-specific cover letters with context  \n- ✅ Stand out with better personalization  \n- ✅ Reduce manual effort with automation  \n\nWhether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro, this tool **elevates your workflow** while staying simple to use.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Import Workflow** to your `n8n` instance  \n2. **Create and Configure MacOS Shortcut** (drag-and-drop ready)  \n3. **Prepare and Embed Your Skills/Project Data** into Pinecone  \n4. **Add API Credentials:**\n   - Groq (for Qwen LLM)  \n   - Pinecone  \n   - n8n Webhook (Basic Auth if needed)  \n5. **Run the Workflow & Submit Smarter Proposals**\n\n&gt; **Note:** This workflow is designed for building and returning Upwork cover letters using job descriptions copied to your clipboard. All generation is context-aware and tailored per submission.\n",
