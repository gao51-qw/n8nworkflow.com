## Brief Overview
This automation template helps you track the latest job listings from the Y Combinator Jobs page. 

By using Scrapeless to scrape job listings, n8n to orchestrate the workflow, and Google Sheets to store the results, you can build a zero-code job tracking solution that runs automatically every 6 hours.

## How It Works
1. Trigger on a Schedule: Every 6 hours, the workflow kicks off automatically.

2. Scrape Job Listings: Scrapeless crawls the Y Combinator Jobs page and returns structured Markdown data.
3. Extract & Parse Content: JavaScript nodes process the Markdown to extract job titles and links.
4. Flatten Data: Each job becomes a single row with its title and link.

5. Save to Google Sheets: New job listings are appended to your Google Sheet for easy viewing and sharing.
