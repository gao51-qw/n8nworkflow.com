## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for transforming a static product image and a creative idea into a dynamic, AI-generated video ad. 

Using Google's state-of-the-art Veo 3 model, this workflow manages the entire creative process from concept to a final, downloadable video file.

## Who's this workflow for?
- E-commerce Brands & Marketers
- Advertising Agencies
- Social Media Content Creators
- Product Managers

## How it works
**1. Submit a Creative Brief:** The workflow starts when a user submits a creative idea via a simple web form (e.g., "A Pepsi can exploding into a vibrant disco party").

**2. Upload a Product Image:** The user is then prompted to upload a corresponding image (e.g., a high-quality photo of the Pepsi can).

**3. Log the Project in Airtable:** The idea and the uploaded image are saved to an Airtable base, which acts as the central tracking system for all video generation projects.

**4. AI Creative Analysis:** Google Gemini analyzes both the user's text prompt and the uploaded image. It acts as an "AI Creative Director," generating a detailed video brief that reinterprets the static image according to the user's creative vision.

**5. Generate Video with Veo 3:** The detailed creative brief is sent to Google's Veo 3 AI video generation model. The workflow initiates a long-running task to create the video.

**6. Retrieve the Final Video:** After a brief waiting period, the workflow polls the Veo 3 API to retrieve the finished video, converts it into a binary file, and makes it available for download directly from the n8n execution log.

## Key Requirements to Use This Template
**n8n Instance & Required Nodes:**
- An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).
This workflow uses the official n8n LangChain integration (@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain).

**Google Cloud Account:**
- A Google Cloud Project with the Vertex AI API enabled.
- You must have access to both the Gemini and Veo 3 models within your project.
- You will need a Gemini API Key and a Google OAuth2 Credential configured for the Vertex AI scope.

**Airtable Account:**

## Setup Instructions
**1. Airtable Configuration (Crucial):**
- In the Create a record, Get a record, and Update record nodes, connect your Airtable credentials and update the Base ID and Table ID to match your setup.

**2. Google AI Configuration (Gemini & Veo):**
- In the Analyze image (Google Gemini) node, select your Gemini API credentials.
- In both the Generate Video Veo 3 and Get the the Video (HTTP Request) nodes:

- Select your Google OAuth2 credentials for authentication.

**3. Customize Video Parameters (Optional):**
- In the Parse Request (Code) node, you can modify the JavaScript code to change video generation settings like aspectRatio, durationSeconds, and resolution.
