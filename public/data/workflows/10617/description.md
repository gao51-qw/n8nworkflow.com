# Automated Brand DNA Generator Using JotForm, Google Search, AI Extraction & Notion

The Brand DNA Generator workflow automatically scans and analyzes online content to build a company’s Brand DNA profile.  It starts with input from a form, then crawls the company’s website and Google search results to gather relevant information. Using AI-powered extraction, the system identifies insights such as value propositions, ideal customer profiles (ICP), pain points, proof points, brand tone, and more.  All results are neatly formatted and automatically saved to a Notion database as a structured Brand DNA report, eliminating the need for manual research.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- Automated data capture, collects company data directly from form submissions and Google search results.  
- Uses AI-powered insight extraction with LLMs to extract and summarize brand-related information from website content.  
- Fetches clean text from multiple web pages using HTTP requests and a content extractor.  
- Merges extracted data from multiple sources into a single Brand DNA JSON structure.  
- Automatically creates a new page in Notion with formatted sections (headings, paragraphs, and bullet points).  
- Handles parsing failures and processes multiple pages efficiently in batches.
