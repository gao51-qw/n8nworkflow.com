Getting Started: Setup & Customization 🛠️
------------------------------------------

Make FamilyFlow Assistant truly yours with these simple steps:

1.  **Import the Workflow:** Add the provided `.json` file to your n8n instance.
2.  **Configure Credentials:**
    *   **Email:** Set up your preferred email sending credential (e.g., SMTP, Gmail) in _all_ “Email Send” nodes. You’ll likely use the same one for all.
3.  **Personalize Content (Crucial!):**
    *   **Email Addresses:** Update parents@example.com to your actual email(s) in all Email nodes.
    *   **Schedules & Activities:** Edit the “Define Daily Schedules” (Set node) with your family’s actual events.
    *   **Meal Ideas:** Customize the mealIdeas array in the “Generate Meal Idea” (Function node).
    *   **Checklists & Prompts:** Tailor the text/HTML in Email nodes for morning/bedtime routines, check-ins, story starters, etc., to fit your family’s style.
    *   **Positive Thoughts/Facts:** Update the lists in the “Get Positive Thought/Fact” (Function node).
4.  **Adjust Triggers (Cron Nodes):**
    *   Modify the “Rule” in each Cron node to set the exact time and frequency for each automation.
5.  **Activate Automations:**
    *   The main workflow and most automations are inactive by default. Toggle the “Active” switch ON for the entire workflow or for individual automations/nodes you wish to use.
    *   Remember, the “Screen Time Break Reminder” is disabled by default; enable its Email node if desired.

How Each Automation Works (Briefly) ⚙️
--------------------------------------

Each automation generally follows this pattern:

1.  **TRIGGER:** An event starts the flow (e.g., a scheduled time via Cron).
2.  **PROCESS:** Data is defined (e.g., list of activities, meal ideas) or generated (e.g., a random selection, a formatted message).
3.  **RESPOND:** An action is taken, typically sending an email with the relevant information or reminder.

For instance, the “Daily Activity Reminder” uses a Cron trigger, a Set node to hold your schedule, a Function node to filter for today’s events, an IF node to check if there are any, and finally an Email node to send the reminder.

Expanding Your Assistant 🚀

FamilyFlow Assistant is a great starting point. Consider these ideas to extend its capabilities:

*   **Integrate Calendars:** Connect to Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar to fetch events dynamically.
*   **Use Different Notifiers:** Send messages via Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or push notifications.
*   **Smart Home Integration:** If you have smart home devices, trigger lights or announcements for routines.
*   **Shared To-Do Lists:** Update a shared Todoist or Microsoft To Do list.
*   **Interactive Input:** Use n8n forms or Telegram commands to add events or trigger specific actions.
