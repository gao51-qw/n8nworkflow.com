# Use Case
This workflow retrieves all members of a Discord server or guild who have a specific role. 

Due to limitations in the Discord API, it only returns a limited number of users per call. To overcome this, the workflow uses Google Sheets to track which user we received last to return all Members (of a certain role) from a Discord server in batches of 100 members.

# Setup
1. Add your Google Sheets and Discord credentials.
2. Create a Google Sheets document that contains `ID` as a column. We're using this to remember which member we received last.
3. Edit the fields in the setup node `Setup: Edit this to get started`. *You can read up on how to get the Discord IDs via [this link](https://www.pythondiscord.com/pages/guides/pydis-guides/contributing/obtaining-discord-ids/).*
4. Link to your Discord server in the Discord nodes
5. Activate the workflow
6. Call the production webhook URL in your browser
