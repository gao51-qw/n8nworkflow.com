## 📘 Description:
 This workflow creates a fully interactive AI-powered Sales CRM Chatbot inside n8n, capable of understanding user queries, searching Google Sheets for CRM data, and responding intelligently based on real records.
 It integrates GPT-4o-mini with two live data sources—Outreach Automation Sheet and GHL Opportunity Database—allowing the bot to answer questions about leads, contact details, proposal links, outreach status, and opportunity information.
 The bot follows strict rules: it never guesses data, always performs lookups before answering, and remembers short-term conversation history for multi-turn chats.
 Every interaction is logged into a “chat_memory” sheet, while invalid responses are captured separately for debugging.
 The result is a real-time Sales Assistant Chat Interface that combines AI reasoning, structured tool calls, CRM lookups, and persistent memory.
