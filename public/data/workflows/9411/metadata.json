  "description": "## Description\nKeep your CRM and task system perfectly in sync — automatically. This workflow monitors a Google Sheet for lead reply updates, instantly updates the corresponding contact in GoHighLevel (GHL), and creates a ClickUp follow-up task when a response is detected. It ensures your sales team never misses a warm lead and every reply is logged, tracked, and acted upon. ⚡\n\n## What This Template Does\n- Watches a Google Sheet for reply status changes (“Yes” in the Replied column). 📄\n- Filters only rows where a lead has replied. 🔍\n- Updates the corresponding contact record in GoHighLevel (GHL). 🔗\n- Automatically creates a follow-up task in ClickUp with lead details. 🗂️\n- Merges updates from both GHL and ClickUp into a single result. 🔄\n- Logs sync status and timestamps in a tracking sheet (Sheet2) for auditing. 📋\n\n## Key Benefits\n- Instant sync: Update GHL and ClickUp the moment a lead replies. ⚙️\n- Zero manual work: Automated updates and follow-up task creation. 🚫\n- Full traceability: Audit trail stored in a second Google Sheet. ✅\n- Increased sales responsiveness: Teams act immediately on new replies. 💬\n- Multi-app harmony: Connects Google Sheets, GHL, and ClickUp seamlessly. 🌐\n\n## Features\n- Google Sheets trigger runs every minute to check for changes. ⏱️\n- Conditional logic (If node) processes only “Replied = Yes” leads. ✅\n- GHL contact update node for CRM synchronization. 💼\n- ClickUp task creation node with customizable priority and naming. 📝\n- Merge node to unify both paths before final sheet update. 🔀\n- Timestamp and action tracking for audit clarity. 📊\n- Visual sticky notes explaining each stage. 🧩\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted). 🧰\n- Google Sheet with headers: Name, GHL_ID, Replied, Email. 📑\n- Connected credentials for:\n- Google Sheets API (Trigger + Update access)\n- GoHighLevel OAuth2 API\n- ClickUp API\n- Separate “log” sheet (Sheet2) for sync tracking. 📄\n\n## Target Audience\n- Sales teams using GoHighLevel for CRM and ClickUp for task management. 🎯\n- Agencies managing multiple client pipelines. 🤝\n- Business development reps who track lead replies manually. 📞\n- Founders automating lead follow-up and CRM hygiene. 🚀\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions (Concise)\n- Prepare a Google Sheet with columns: Name, GHL_ID, Email, Replied. 📋\n- Add a second sheet (“Sheet2”) for tracking updates. 📊\n- Connect credentials for Google Sheets, GoHighLevel, and ClickUp in n8n. 🔐\n- Import and open this workflow.\n- Update GHL contact field mappings if your CRM structure differs. ⚙️\n- Adjust ClickUp team, space, and list IDs to match your setup. 📂\n- Execute manually once for testing, then enable it to run every minute. ▶️\n\n## Security Best Practices\n- Share your Google Sheet only with the n8n Google account (Editor). 🔒\n- Keep API credentials securely stored in n8n’s credential manager. 🛡️\n- Log timestamps for traceability and rollback. ⏳\n- Periodically archive older sync logs to keep the sheet lightweight. 🧹",
