 ## Automated AI Content Creation & Instagram Publishing from Google Sheets

This n8n workflow automates the creation and publishing of social media content directly to Instagram, using ideas stored in a Google Sheet. It leverages AI (Google Gemini and Replicate Flux) to generate concepts, image prompts, captions, and the final image, turning your content plan into reality with minimal manual intervention.

**Think of this as the execution engine for your content strategy.** It assumes you have a separate process (whether manual entry, another workflow, or a different tool) for populating the Google Sheet with initial post ideas (including `Topic`, `Audience`, `Voice`, and `Platform`). This workflow takes those ideas and handles the rest, from AI generation to final publication.

### What does this workflow do?

This workflow streamlines the content execution process by:

*   **Automatically fetching** unprocessed content ideas from a designated Google Sheet based on a schedule.
*   Using **Google Gemini** to generate a platform-specific content concept (specifically for a 'Single Image' format).
*   Generating **two distinct AI image prompt options** based on the concept using Gemini.
*   Writing an engaging, platform-tailored **caption** (including hashtags) using Gemini, based on the *first* prompt option.
*   Generating a **visual image** using the *first* prompt option via the **Replicate API** (using the Flux model).
*   **Publishing** the generated image and caption directly to a connected **Instagram Business account**.
*   **Updating the status** in the Google Sheet to mark the idea as completed, preventing reprocessing.

### Who is this for?

*   **Social Media Managers & Agencies:** Automate the execution of your content calendar stored in Google Sheets.
*   **Marketing Teams:** Streamline content production from planned ideas and ensure consistent posting schedules.
*   **Content Creators & Solopreneurs:** Save significant time by automating the generation and publishing process based on your pre-defined ideas.
*   **Anyone** using Google Sheets to plan social media content and wanting to automate the creative generation and posting steps with AI.

### Benefits

*   **Full Automation:** From fetching planned ideas to Instagram publishing, automate the entire content execution pipeline.
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** Leverage Google Gemini for creative concepts, prompts, and captions, and Replicate for image generation based on your initial topic.
*   **Content Calendar Execution:** Directly turn your Google Sheet plan into published posts.
*   **Time Savings:** Drastically reduce the manual effort involved in creating visuals and text for each planned post.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a regular posting schedule by automatically processing your queue of ideas.
*   **Platform-Specific Content:** AI prompts are designed to tailor concepts, prompts, and captions for the platform specified in your sheet (e.g., Instagram or LinkedIn).

### How it Works

1.  **Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow starts automatically based on the schedule you set (e.g., every hour, daily).
2.  **Fetch Idea:** Reads the next row from your Google Sheet where the 'Status' column indicates it's pending (e.g., '0'). It only fetches one idea per run.
3.  **Prepare Inputs:** Extracts `Topic`, `Audience`, `Voice`, and `Platform` from the sheet data.
4.  **AI Concept Generation (Gemini):** Creates a single content concept suitable for a 'Single Image' post on the target platform.
5.  **AI Prompt Generation (Gemini):** Develops two detailed, distinct image prompt options based on the concept.
6.  **AI Caption Generation (Gemini):** Writes a caption tailored to the platform, using the *first* image prompt and other context.
7.  **Image Generation (Replicate):** Sends the *first* prompt to the Replicate API (Flux model) to generate the image.
8.  **Prepare for Instagram:** Formats the generated image URL and caption.
9.  **Publish to Instagram:** Uses the Facebook Graph API in three steps:
    *   Creates a media container by uploading the image URL and caption.
    *   Waits for Instagram to process the container.
    *   Publishes the processed container to your feed.
10. **Update Sheet:** Changes the 'Status' in the Google Sheet for the processed row (e.g., to '1') to mark it as complete.

### n8n Nodes Used

*   Schedule Trigger
*   Google Sheets (Read & Update operations)
*   Set (Multiple instances for data preparation)
*   Langchain Chain - LLM (Multiple instances for Gemini calls)
*   Langchain Chat Model - Google Gemini (Multiple instances)
*   Langchain Output Parser - Structured (Multiple instances)
*   HTTP Request (for Replicate API call)
*   Wait
*   Facebook Graph API (Multiple instances for Instagram publishing steps)

### Prerequisites

*   Active n8n instance (Cloud or Self-Hosted).
*   **Google Account** with access to Google Sheets.
*   **Google Sheets API Credentials (OAuth2):** Configured in n8n.
*   **A Google Sheet** structured with columns like `Topic`, `Audience`, `Voice`, `Platform`, `Status` (or similar). Ensure your 'pending' and 'completed' statuses are defined (e.g., '0' and '1').
*   **Google Cloud Project** with the Vertex AI API enabled.
*   **Google Gemini API Credentials:** Configured in n8n (usually via Google Vertex AI credentials).
*   **Replicate Account** and API Token.
*   **Replicate API Credentials (Header Auth):** Configured in n8n.
*   **Facebook Developer Account**.
*   **Instagram Business Account** connected to a Facebook Page.
*   **Facebook App** with necessary permissions: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_content_publish`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_show_list`.
*   **Facebook Graph API Credentials (OAuth2):** Configured in n8n with the required permissions.

### Setup

1.  Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.
2.  **Configure Schedule Trigger:** Set the desired frequency (e.g., every 30 minutes, every 4 hours) for checking new ideas in the sheet.
3.  **Configure Google Sheets Nodes:**
    *   Select your Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials for both Google Sheets nodes.
    *   In `1. Get Next Post Idea...`, enter your Spreadsheet ID and Sheet Name. Verify the `Status` filter matches your 'pending' value (e.g., `0`).
    *   In `7. Update Post Status...`, enter the same Spreadsheet ID and Sheet Name. Ensure the `Matching Columns` (e.g., `Topic`) and the `Status` value to update match your 'completed' value (e.g., `1`).
4.  **Configure Google Gemini Nodes:** Select your configured Google Vertex AI / Gemini credentials in all `Google Gemini Chat Model` nodes.
5.  **Configure Replicate Node (`4. Generate Image...`):** Select your Replicate Header Auth credentials. The workflow uses `black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro-ultra` by default; you can change this if needed.
6.  **Configure Facebook Graph API Nodes (`6a`, `6c`):**
    *   Select your Facebook Graph API OAuth2 credentials.
    *   **Crucially, update the Instagram Account ID** in the `Node` parameter of both Facebook Graph API nodes (`6a` and `6c`). The template uses a placeholder (`17841473009917118`); replace this with your actual Instagram Business Account ID.
7.  **Adjust Wait Node (`6b`):** The default wait time might be sufficient, but if you encounter errors during publishing (especially with larger images/videos in the future), you might need to increase the wait duration.
8.  **Activate the workflow.**
9.  **Populate your Google Sheet:** Ensure you have rows with your content ideas and the correct 'pending' status (e.g., '0'). The workflow will pick them up on its next scheduled run.
