![Peliqan n8n template Cin7 AI Chatbot.png](fileId:2065)

## How it works

This template is an end-to-end demo of an in-house AI agent that can answer a wide range of questions by retrieving information from the Cin7 ERP system. For example users can ask questions related to products, stock, accounting or any other type of information contained in Cin7.

Peliqan.io is used as a "cache" of all Cin7 data. Peliqan uses one-click ELT to sync all data from Cin7 to the built-in data warehouse, allowing for fast & accurate queries. The AI agent uses Text-to-SQL to answer questions.

Text-to-SQL is performed via the Peliqan node, added as a tool to the AI Agent. The question of the user - in natural language - is converted to an SQL query by the AI Agent. The query is executed by Peliqan.io on the source Cin7 data and the result is interpreted by the AI Agent.
