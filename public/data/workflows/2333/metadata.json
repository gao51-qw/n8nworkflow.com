  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates creating a recipe recommendation chatbot using the Qdrant vector store recommendation API.\n\nUse this example to build recommendation features in your AI Agents for your users.\n\n## How it works\n\n* For our recipes, we'll use HelloFresh's weekly course and recipes for data. We'll scrape the website for this data.\n* Each recipe is split, vectorised and inserted into a Qdrant Collection using Mistral Embeddings\n* Additionally the whole recipe is stored in a SQLite database for later retrieval.\n* Our AI Agent is setup to recommend recipes from our Qdrant vector store. However, instead of the default similarity search, we'll use the Recommendation API instead.\n* Qdrant's Recommendation API allows you to provide a negative prompt; in our case, the user can specify recipes or ingredients to avoid.\n* The AI Agent is now able to suggest a recipe recommendation better suited for the user and increase customer satisfaction.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Qdrant vector store instance to save the recipes\n* Mistral.ai account for embeddings and LLM agent\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nThis workflow can work for a variety of different audiences. Try different sets of data such as clothes, sports shoes, vehicles or even holidays.",
