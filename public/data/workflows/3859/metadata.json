  "description": "**AI Customer-Support Assistant that auto-maps any business site, answers WhatsApp in real time, and lets you earn or save thousands by replacing pricey SaaS chat tools.**\n\n---\n\n### ⚡ What the workflow does\n\n* **Live “AI employee”** - the bot crawls pages on demand (products, policies, FAQs) so you **never** upload documents or fine-tune a model.\n* **No-code setup** - Drop in API keys, paste your domain, publish the webhook—ready in \\~15 min.\n* **Chat memory** - each conversation turn is written to Supabase/Postgres and automatically replayed into the next prompt, letting the assistant remember context so follow-up questions feel natural and coherent even across long sessions.\n* **WhatsApp ready** - Free-form replies inside the 24-hour service window, automatically switches to a template when required (recommended by Meta).\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Why you’ll love it\n\n| Benefit                   | Impact                                                                |\n| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Zero content training** | Point the AI Agent at any domain → go live.                            |\n| **Save or earn money**    | Replace pricey SaaS chat tools *or* sell white-label bots to clients. |\n| **Channel-agnostic**      | Ships with WhatsApp; swap one node for Telegram, Slack, or web chat.  |\n| **Flexible voice**        | Adjust tone & language by editing one prompt line.                    |\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 Prerequisites (all free-tier friendly)\n\n* OpenAI key\n* Meta WhatsApp Cloud API number + permanent token (easy setup)\n* Supabase (or Postgres) URL for chat memory (easy setup)\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 5-step setup\n\n1. Import the template into n8n.\n2. Add credentials for OpenAI, WhatsApp, and Supabase.\n3. Enter your root domain in the *root\\_url* variable.\n4. Point Meta’s Webhook to the n8n URL.\n5. Hit **Execute Trigger** and send “Hi” from WhatsApp—watch the bot answer with live data.\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Easy to extend\n\n* **Voice & language** – change wording in the System Prompt.\n* **Escalation** – add an “If fallback” branch → Zendesk, email, live agents.\n* **Extra channels** – duplicate the reply node for Telegram or Slack.\n* **Commerce API hooks** – plug in Shopify, Woo, Stripe for order status or payments.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Monetization ideas\n\n* **Replace costly SaaS seats.** Deploy the bot on your own server and *stop paying \\$300–\\$500 every month* for third-party “AI support” platforms.\n* **Sell it as a service.** Spin up a branded instance for local shops, clinics, or e-commerce stores and **charge each client \\$300–\\$500 per month**—setup time is under 15 minutes.\n* Upsell premium coverage (24/7 human hand-off) once the bot handles routine questions.\n* Embed product links in answers and earn affiliate or upsell revenue automatically.\n\n---\n\nSpin it up, connect a domain and a phone number, and you—or your customers—get enterprise-grade support without code, training, or ongoing licence fees.\n",
