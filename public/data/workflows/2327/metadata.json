  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how to build a simple uptime monitoring service using scheduled triggers.\n\nUseful for webmasters with a handful of sites who want a cost-effective solution without the need for all the bells and whistles.\n\n## How it works\n* Scheduled trigger reads a list of website urls in a Google Sheet every 5 minutes\n* Each website url is checked using the HTTP node which determines if the website is either in the UP or DOWN state.\n* An email and Slack message are sent for websites which are in the DOWN state.\n* The Google Sheet is updated with the website's state and a log created.\n* Logs can be used to determine total % of UP and DOWN time over a period.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Sheet for storing websites to monitor and their states\n* Gmail for email alerts\n* Slack for channel alerts\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nDon't use Google Sheets? This can easily be exchanged with Excel or Airtable.",
