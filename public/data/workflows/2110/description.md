# How It works

It's very important to come prepared to Sales calls. This often means a lot of manual research about the person you're calling with. This workflow delivers the latest news about businesses you are about to interact with each day.

- **Scans Your Calendar**: Each morning, it reviews your Google Calendar for any scheduled meetings or calls with companies.
- **Fetches Latest News**: For each identified company, it searches the web for the most recent and relevant news articles using newsapi.org
- **Delivers Insights**: You receive personalized emails via Gmail, each dedicated to a company you're meeting with that day, containing a curated list of news headlines, brief descriptions, and direct links to full articles.

The workflow requires you to have the following accounts set up in their respective nodes:
1. Google Calendar
2. GMail

Besides those, there are a few parameters in the node called `Setup` that can be used to tweak the workflow:
