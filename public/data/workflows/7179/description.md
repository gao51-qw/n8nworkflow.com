This n8n workflow enables an AI-powered symptom checker where users input symptoms via a form or chat, analyzes them using an AI model, matches possible conditions, and suggests relevant doctors with contact details via WhatsApp or email, enhancing healthcare accessibility.

## Why Use It

This workflow improves healthcare outreach by providing quick, AI-driven symptom analysis and doctor recommendations, reducing the burden on medical staff, empowering users with informed choices, and streamlining appointment scheduling.

## How to Import It

1. **Download the Workflow JSON**: Obtain the workflow file from the n8n template or create it based on this document.
2. **Import into n8n**: In your n8n instance, go to "Workflows," click the three dots, select "Import from File," and upload the JSON.
3. **Configure Credentials**: Set up form/webhook, AI model, WhatsApp, email (e.g., SMTP), and optional doctor database API credentials in n8n.
4. **Run the Workflow**: Test with a sample symptom input and verify responses.
