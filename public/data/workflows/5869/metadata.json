Upload a Revit file as input\n2. Workflow extracts wall quantities and types\n3. Creates and saves a ready-to-share HTML dashboard with QTO data\n\n---\n\n- No API keys required\n- Runs offline\n- Output is a professional, ready-to-use HTML report\n\n## Consulting and Training\nWe work with leading construction, engineering, consulting agencies and technology firms around the world to help them implement open data principles, automate CAD/BIM processing and build robust ETL pipelines.\n\nIf you would like to test this solution with your own data, or are interested in adapting the workflow to real project tasks, feel free to contact us.\n\n## Author\n [DataDrivenConstruction.io ](https://DataDrivenConstruction.io )\n [info@datadrivenconstruction.io](mailto:info@datadrivenconstruction.io)\n\n**Docs & Issues:**  \n  [Full Readme on GitHub](https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/cad2data-Revit-IFC-DWG-DGN-pipeline-with-conversion-validation-qto)",
