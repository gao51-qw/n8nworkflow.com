**How it works:**
The n8n flow grabs the needed IDs, fetches the current links, adds your new one, and sends a single HTTP request to NocoDB to update the record’s linked entries.

**Set up steps:**

* Plan for 10 minutes setup if you’re already running n8n and NocoDB.
* You’ll need to copy/paste table IDs, set up your HTTP node, and test once.
* No coding, just copy IDs.
