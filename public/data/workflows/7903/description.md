The workflow automatically sends **acceptance or rejection emails** to candidates — be sure to configure your Gmail account and email templates carefully.

**How it works**

* **Form Submission**: Applicants fill out a custom form with their name, email, job role (Executive Assistant, IT Specialist, or Manager), and resume (PDF).
* **Resume Processing**: The PDF resume is extracted into text using the Extract from File node.
* **AI Evaluation**: Gemini-powered AI reviews the resume against the job role and generates:

  1. A **score (0–10)**
  2. A **status (Accepted/Rejected)**
  3. A **personalized email** (acceptance or rejection)
* **Information Extraction**: The AI output is structured into fields: Score, Status, Mail Subject, and Mail Body.
* **Email Sending**: The candidate automatically receives their personalized result via Gmail.
* **Record Keeping**: All candidate details (Name, Job, Score, Status, Email, Email Status) are stored in Google Sheets for tracking.

---

**How to use**

* Share the generated form link with applicants.
* When they submit, the system handles scoring and sends an email instantly.
* HR teams can review all results directly in Google Sheets.

---

**Requirements**

* Google Gemini API key (for resume evaluation)
* Gmail account with OAuth2 (for sending acceptance/rejection emails)
* Google Sheets (for candidate tracking)

**Customising this workflow**

* Adjust the acceptance threshold (e.g., accept at 8/10 instead of 7/10).
* Modify email templates for a more formal or branded tone.
* Extend the pipeline to trigger a **Calendly invite** for accepted candidates.
* Integrate with **Slack or Teams** to notify HR when a candidate is accepted.
