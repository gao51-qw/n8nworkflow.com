  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for travel bloggers, content creators, social media managers, and anyone who wants to transform their travel photos into engaging written narratives. It's perfect for travelers looking to create compelling stories from their photo collections without spending hours crafting content manually, families wanting to document memorable trips, and digital nomads who need to produce travel content efficiently.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nConverting travel photos into engaging stories is time-consuming and requires both creative writing skills and the ability to analyze visual content meaningfully. This workflow solves the challenge of:\n\n- Transforming visual memories into compelling written narratives\n- Organizing photos chronologically to create logical story flow\n- Generating professional-quality travel content without writing expertise\n- Analyzing photo content to extract meaningful themes and emotions\n- Creating day-by-day structured narratives from unorganized photo collections\n- Reducing the time spent on manual content creation for travel documentation\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis AI-powered photo storyteller takes your travel photos and automatically generates immersive, first-person travel narratives. The workflow:\n\n- Accepts multiple photos through a webhook endpoint\n- Uses OpenAI Vision API (GPT-4o) to analyze each photo's content, emotions, and themes\n- Automatically organizes photos chronologically by date and timestamp\n- Groups photos by travel days and extracts daily themes\n- Leverages GPT-4.1 (minimum required) to craft engaging, first-person travel stories with creative day titles\n- Generates structured narratives with sensory details, cultural observations, and emotional insights\n- Outputs JSON formatted content ready for formatting\n- Creates day-by-day story structure with memorable moments and reflective conclusions\n\n## Setup\n\n**Required Credentials:**\n- OpenAI API key configured in n8n for both Vision Analysis and Story Generation nodes\n- Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits for image analysis and text generation\n\n**Webhook Configuration:**\n- The workflow creates a webhook endpoint at `/tripteller-upload`\n- Configure your photo upload interface to POST photos array to this endpoint\n- Photos should be sent as base64 encoded data with filename and metadata\n\n**Photo Requirements:**\n- Supported formats: Standard image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)\n- Photos should include timestamp metadata for chronological organization\n\n**Caution**\n- Do not upload all photos at once. \n- Start with a small number of photos, like 5 at a time.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n**Story Style Customization:**\n- Modify the system prompt in the \"Generate Travel Story\" node to adjust writing tone (nostalgic, adventurous, poetic, etc.)\n- Customize the story structure by editing the output format requirements\n- Add specific cultural or geographical context prompts for location-specific storytelling\n\n**Photo Analysis Enhancement:**\n- Adjust the Vision Analysis node prompt to focus on specific elements (architecture, food, people, landscapes)\n- Modify the grouping logic in the \"Group Photos by Day\" node for different time-based organization\n- Add location extraction from EXIF data for geographical context\n\n**Output Format Adjustment:**\n- Customize the final response structure in the \"Format Final Response\" node\n- Add integration with publishing platforms (blog APIs, social media, etc.)\n- Include additional metadata like location tags, travel duration, or trip statistics\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\n- Adjust the execution timeout based on your typical photo volume\n- Modify the parallel processing approach for large photo collections\n- Add progress tracking for longer processing workflows\n",
