  "description": "![wflowpreview.JPG](fileId:2061)\nAuto-detect news from n8n and turn into a human-approved LinkedIn post.\n**gotoHuman** is used to keep a human in the loop. There you can manually edit the AI draft of the post or request to regenerate it.\n\n## How it works\n1. The workflow is triggered each day to fetch the latest version of `https://blog.n8n.io`.\n2. It then fetches each article, checks if it was published in the last 24 hours and uses an LLM to summarize it.\n3. An LLM then drafts a related LinkedIn post which is sent to **gotoHuman** for approval. In gotoHuman, the reviewer can manually edit it or ask to regenerate it with the option to even edit the prompt (Retries loop back to the _AI Draft LinkedIn Post_ node)\n![gthpreview.JPG](fileId:2060)\n![gthchat.JPG](fileId:2062)\n4. Approved Posts are automatically published to LinkedIn\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Most importantly, install the gotoHuman node before importing this template!**\n(Just add the node to a blank canvas before importing)\n2. Set up your credentials for gotoHuman, OpenAI, and LinkedIn\n3. In gotoHuman, select and create the pre-built review template \"Blog scraper agent\" or import the ID: `sMxevC9tSAgdfWsr6XIW`\n4. Select this template in the gotoHuman node\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou need accounts for\n- gotoHuman (human supervision)\n- OpenAI (summary, draft)\n- LinkedIn\n\n## How to customize\n\n- Change the blog URL to monitor. Adapt to its' HTML structure\n- Provide the _AI Draft LinkedIn Post_ with examples of previous posts so it picks up your writing style (consider adding [gotoHuman's dataset of approved examples](https://docs.gotohuman.com/training-data))\n- Use the workflow to target other publications, like your newsletter, blog or other socials",
