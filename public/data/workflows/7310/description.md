Auto-detect news from n8n and turn into a human-approved LinkedIn post.
**gotoHuman** is used to keep a human in the loop. There you can manually edit the AI draft of the post or request to regenerate it.

## How it works
1. The workflow is triggered each day to fetch the latest version of `https://blog.n8n.io`.
2. It then fetches each article, checks if it was published in the last 24 hours and uses an LLM to summarize it.
3. An LLM then drafts a related LinkedIn post which is sent to **gotoHuman** for approval. In gotoHuman, the reviewer can manually edit it or ask to regenerate it with the option to even edit the prompt (Retries loop back to the _AI Draft LinkedIn Post_ node)
