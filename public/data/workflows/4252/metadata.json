  "description": "# Recursive Web Scraping \n\n## Use Case  \nAutomating web scraping with recursive depth is ideal for collecting content across multiple linked pages—perfect for content aggregation, lead generation, or research projects.\n\n## What This Automation Does  \nThis automation reads a list of URLs from a Google Sheet, scrapes each page, stores the content in a document, and adds newly discovered links back to the sheet. It continues this process for a specified number of iterations based on the defined scraping depth.\n\n### Input Parameters:\n- `Seed URL`: The starting URL to begin the scraping process.  \n  Example: `https://example.com/`\n- `Links must contain`: Restricts the links to those that contain this specified string.  \n  Example: `https://example.com/`\n- `Depth`: The number of iterations (layers of links) to scrape beyond the initial set.  \n  Example: `3`\n\n## How It Works  \n1. Starts by reading the `Seed URL` from the Google Sheet.\n2. Scrapes each page and saves its content to the specified document.\n3. Extracts new links from each page that match the `Links must contain` string, appends them to the Google Sheet.\n4. Repeats steps 2–3 for the number of times specified by `Depth - 1`.\n\n## Setup Requirements  \n1. [Airtop API Key](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys) — free to generate.  \n2. Credentials set up for Google Docs (requires creating a project on Google Console). Read [how to](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).  \n3. Credentials set up for Google Spreadsheet.\n\n## Next Steps  \n- **Add Filtering Rules**: Filter which links to follow based on domain, path, or content type.  \n- **Combine with Scheduler**: Run this automation on a schedule to continuously explore newly discovered pages.  \n- **Export Structured Data**: Extend the process to store extracted data in a CSV or database for analysis.\n\nRead more about [website scraping for LLMS](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/scrape-website-data-n8n)\n",
