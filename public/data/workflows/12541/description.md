## How It Works
This workflow automates customer feedback processing by analyzing sentiment, identifying key issues, generating personalized responses, and escalating critical cases to support teams when required. Designed for customer success managers, support teams, and product managers, it enables scalable feedback handling without compromising response quality or urgency. The workflow eliminates manual triage and response drafting by normalizing incoming feedback, performing sentiment and topic analysis, generating context-aware AI responses, validating tone and intent, escalating high-risk or negative feedback, logging all interactions for traceability, and delivering automated replies via email.
