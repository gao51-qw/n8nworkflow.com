  "description": "**Description:** An intelligent alarm system that wakes you up early only when necessary. 🛡️🤖\n\nThis workflow monitors your local weather and train status every morning at 5:00 AM. It uses Google Gemini to analyze the situation. If there is heavy rain or a train delay, it sends an emergency alert immediately (and can trigger smart home devices). If everything is normal, it waits until your usual wake-up time to send a calm briefing.\n\n## Key Features:\n\nAI Context Awareness: Uses Gemini to intelligently judge \"Emergency\" situations based on weather descriptions and news headlines.\n\nDynamic Notification:\n\nEmergency Mode: Immediate Email alert + Optional SwitchBot trigger (e.g., turn on lights).\n\nNormal Mode: Delays notification until your scheduled wake-up time (90 mins later).\n\nTargeted Monitoring: Searches specific train lines via Google News RSS.\n\n## How it works:\n\nTrigger: Runs daily at 5:00 AM.\n\nFetch: Gets weather from OpenWeatherMap and train news from Google News RSS.\n\nJudge: Gemini analyzes the data.\n\nAction: Routes the notification based on the status (Emergency/Normal).\n\n## Setup Requirements:\n\nCredentials: OpenWeatherMap API, Google Gemini API, Gmail.\n\nConfig: Open the \"1. Configuration\" node to set your Location, Train Line, and Email.",
