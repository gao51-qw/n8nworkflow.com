**What this workflow does**
- Downloads the daily top podcasts of a selected genre
- Summarizes the content of each podcast in a few paragraphs
- Sends the summaries and the direct link to each podcast in a formatted email

**Setup**
 1. Create a free API key on Taddy here: https://taddy.org/signup/developers

 3. Create access credentials for your Gmail as described here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials. Use the credentials from your *client_secret.json* in the `Gmail` node.
 4. In the `Genre` node, set the genre of podcasts you want a summary for. Valid values are: TECHNOLOGY, NEWS, ARTS, COMEDY, SPORTS, FICTION, etc. Look at api.taddy.org for the full list (they will be displayed in the help docs as PODCASTSERIES_TECHNOLOGY, PODCASTSERIES_NEWS, etc.)
 5. Enter your email address in the `Gmail` node.
