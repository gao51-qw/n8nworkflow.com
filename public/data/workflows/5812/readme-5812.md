## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid API Key" (MailChimp)**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check that your MailChimp account is active

2. **"Sheet not found" (Google Sheets)**
   - Verify the sheet ID is correct
   - Ensure the service account has access to the sheet

3. **"Email already exists" errors**
   - This is normal for existing subscribers
   - The workflow will continue processing other contacts

4. **Missing data in MailChimp**
   - Check that column names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Verify data exists in the Google Sheet

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test with a small dataset first
2. **Backup Data**: Export your MailChimp list before large imports
3. **Clean Data**: Ensure email addresses are valid before importing
4. **Monitor Regularly**: Check import summaries for any issues
5. **Respect Privacy**: Only import contacts who have consented to receive emails
