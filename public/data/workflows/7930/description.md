What this template does

Collects the latest crypto news from multiple RSS feeds, filters and deduplicates them, uses OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze and select the top stories, translates and formats them into Russian, and posts a digest to a Telegram channel or group. The workflow runs automatically on a schedule and ensures all messages fit Telegram’s 4096-character limit.

How it works (high level)

RSS Sources: Reads fresh items from CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, Cryptobriefing, and Nulltx.

Filter & Deduplicate: Keeps only unique items from the last 24 hours.

AI Analysis (Crypto Analyst): An OpenAI agent identifies the most important events and selects the best article for each.

AI Formatting (SMM Editor): Another OpenAI agent writes a styled digest in Russian with Telegram-compatible HTML formatting.

Message Preparation: Long texts are split into safe chunks ≤ 4096 characters.

Telegram Post: The digest is posted automatically to your configured Telegram channel or group.
