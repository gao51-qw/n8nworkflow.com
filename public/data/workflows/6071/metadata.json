  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis comprehensive recruitment automation workflow transforms your hiring process from manual screening to intelligent candidate management. The system begins by automatically collecting CVs from multiple job boards and career platforms, immediately parsing each submission using advanced AI technology to extract key information including skills, experience levels, educational background, and career progression patterns.\n\nOnce parsed, the workflow employs predictive scoring algorithms that evaluate each candidate against your specific job requirements and company culture criteria. This multi-dimensional analysis considers technical skills alignment, experience relevance, cultural fit indicators, and career trajectory patterns to generate compatibility scores with remarkable accuracy.\n\nThe system then seamlessly transitions qualified candidates into automated interview scheduling, coordinating availability across hiring managers, team members, and candidates while optimizing for timezone considerations and calendar conflicts. Finally, successful candidates enter a personalized onboarding workflow that adapts to their role, department, and experience level, ensuring smooth integration into your organization.\n\n## Target audience and problem solved\n\nThis workflow is designed for HR departments, talent acquisition teams, and growing companies struggling with time-intensive recruitment processes.
