    "description": "# Medical Research Tracker with Matrix and Pipedrive\n\n**⚠️ COMMUNITY TEMPLATE DISCLAIMER: This is a community-contributed template that uses ScrapeGraphAI (a community node). Please ensure you have the ScrapeGraphAI community node installed in your n8n instance before using this template.**\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors selected government and healthcare-policy websites, extracts newly published or updated policy documents, logs them as deals in a Pipedrive pipeline, and announces critical changes in a Matrix room. It gives healthcare administrators and policy analysts a near real-time view of policy developments without manual web checks.\n\n## Pre-conditions/Requirements\n\n### Prerequisites\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n cloud)\n- ScrapeGraphAI community node installed\n- Active Pipedrive account with at least one pipeline\n- Matrix account & accessible room for notifications\n- Basic knowledge of n8n credential setup\n\n### Required Credentials\n- **ScrapeGraphAI API Key** – Enables the scraping engine  \n- **Pipedrive OAuth2 / API Token** – Creates & updates deals  \n- **Matrix Credentials** – Homeserver URL, user, access token (or password)\n\n### Specific Setup Requirements\n| Variable | Description | Example |\n|----------|-------------|---------|\n| `POLICY_SITES` | Comma-separated list of URLs to scrape | `https://health.gov/policies,https://who.int/proposals` |\n| `PD_PIPELINE_ID` | Pipedrive pipeline where deals are created | `5` |\n| `PD_STAGE_ID_ALERT` | Stage ID for “Review Needed” | `17` |\n| `MATRIX_ROOM_ID` | Room to send alerts (incl. leading `!`) | `!policy:matrix.org` |\n\nEdit the initial *Set* node to provide these values before running.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors selected government and healthcare-policy websites, extracts newly published or updated policy documents, logs them as deals in a Pipedrive pipeline, and announces critical changes in a Matrix room. It gives healthcare administrators and policy analysts a near real-time view of policy developments without manual web checks.\n\n## Key Steps:\n- **Scheduled Trigger**: Runs every 6 hours (configurable) to start the monitoring cycle.\n- **Code (URL List Builder)**: Generates an array from `POLICY_SITES` for downstream batching.\n- **SplitInBatches**: Iterates through each policy URL individually.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI**: Scrapes page titles, publication dates, and summary paragraphs.\n- **If (New vs Existing)**: Compares scraped hash with last run; continues only for fresh content.\n- **Merge (Aggregate Results)**: Collects all “new” policies into a single payload.\n- **Set (Deal Formatter)**: Maps scraped data to Pipedrive deal fields.\n- **Pipedrive Node**: Creates or updates a deal per policy item.\n- **Matrix Node**: Posts a formatted alert message in the specified Matrix room.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup Time: 15-20 minutes**\n\n1. **Install Community Node**  \n   – In n8n, go to *Settings → Community Nodes → Install* and search for **ScrapeGraphAI**.\n\n2. **Add Credentials**  \n   – *Create New* credentials for ScrapeGraphAI, Pipedrive, and Matrix under *Credentials*.\n\n3. **Configure Environment Variables**  \n   – Open the *Set (Initial Config)* node and replace placeholders (`POLICY_SITES`, `PD_PIPELINE_ID`, etc.) with your values.\n\n4. **Review Schedule**  \n   – Double-click the *Schedule Trigger* node to adjust the interval if needed.\n\n5. **Activate Workflow**  \n   – Click *Activate*. The workflow will run at the next scheduled interval.\n\n6. **Verify Outputs**  \n   – Check Pipedrive for new deals and the Matrix room for alert messages after the first run.\n\n## Node Descriptions\n\n### Core Workflow Nodes:\n- **stickyNote** – Provides an at-a-glance description of the workflow logic directly on the canvas.\n- **scheduleTrigger** – Fires the workflow periodically (default 6 hours).\n- **code (URL List Builder)** – Splits the `POLICY_SITES` variable into an array.\n- **splitInBatches** – Ensures each URL is processed individually to avoid timeouts.\n- **scrapegraphAi** – Parses HTML and extracts policy metadata using XPath/CSS selectors.\n- **if (New vs Existing)** – Uses hashing to ignore unchanged pages.\n- **merge** – Combines all new items so they can be processed in bulk.\n- **set (Deal Formatter)** – Maps scraped fields to Pipedrive deal properties.\n- **matrix** – Sends formatted messages to a Matrix room for team visibility.\n- **pipedrive** – Creates or updates deals representing each policy update.\n\n### Data Flow:\n1. **scheduleTrigger** → **code** → **splitInBatches** → **scrapegraphAi** → **if** → **merge** → **set** → **pipedrive** → **matrix**\n\n## Customization Examples\n\n### 1. Add another data field (e.g., policy author)\n```javascript\n// Inside ScrapeGraphAI node → Selectors\n{\n  \"title\": \"//h1/text()\",\n  \"date\": \"//time/@datetime\",\n  \"summary\": \"//p[1]/text()\",\n  \"author\": \"//span[@class='author']/text()\"   // new line\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Switch notifications from Matrix to Email\n```javascript\n// Replace Matrix node with “Send Email”\n{\n  \"to\": \"policy-team@example.com\",\n  \"subject\": \"New Healthcare Policy Detected: {{$json.title}}\",\n  \"text\": \"Summary:\\n{{$json.summary}}\\n\\nRead more at {{$json.url}}\"\n}\n```\n\n## Data Output Format\n\nThe workflow outputs structured JSON data for each new policy article:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Affordable Care Expansion Act – 2024\",\n  \"url\": \"https://health.gov/policies/acea-2024\",\n  \"date\": \"2024-06-14T09:00:00Z\",\n  \"summary\": \"Proposes expansion of coverage to rural areas...\",\n  \"source\": \"health.gov\",\n  \"hash\": \"2d6f1c8e3b...\"\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ScrapeGraphAI returns empty objects**  \n   – Verify selectors match the current HTML structure; inspect the site with developer tools and update the node configuration.\n\n2. **Duplicate deals appear in Pipedrive**  \n   – Ensure the “Find or Create” option is enabled in the Pipedrive node, using the page `hash` or `url` as a unique key.\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Limit `POLICY_SITES` to under 50 URLs per run to avoid hitting rate limits.\n- Increase Schedule Trigger interval if you notice ScrapeGraphAI rate-limiting.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Store historical scraped data in a database node for long-term audit trails.\n- Use the n8n *Workflow Executions* page to replay failed runs without waiting for the next schedule.\n- Add an *Error Trigger* node to emit alerts if scraping or API calls fail.",

Every 24 hours the Schedule Trigger fires and a Code node emits a curated list of source URLs for HHS, CMS, and FDA. The list is split so each page can be scraped in parallel by ScrapeGraphAI, which pulls titles, publication dates, links, and short summaries. Normalization code cleans the response and flags anything published in the last 24 hours. After all branches finish, a Merge node passes the combined data to a deduplication step and then an IF gate. Items judged “new” are pushed into Pipedrive as open deals and, at the same time, a Matrix message  alerts the policy team. Older or duplicate items flow silently past the gate, preventing noise.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. Add ScrapeGraphAI credentials\n2. Add Matrix account credentials and room ID\n3. Add Pipedrive API credentials\n4. Edit the Code node to point at your preferred policy URLs\n5. Adjust the schedule interval if needed\n6. Activate and test with manual execution"

The **Schedule Trigger** launches the workflow once a day (you can change the interval to any cron or interval rule). Immediately after, the **Define Policy URLs** Code node returns an array of JSON items that list the web pages you care about—by default HHS, CMS, and FDA news portals. Using a code-based list keeps the workflow flexible; simply add or remove objects in the array to monitor different agencies or policy think-tanks without touching downstream logic. Each item also includes a `source` label so we can track which agency generated a specific policy alert later on when we send notifications or store records. Passing a tidy, predictable payload at this early stage prevents headaches further down the line and sets up the Split node for smooth batch processing."

The **Fetch Policy Data** ScrapeGraphAI node consumes the `url` field from each item and uses an LLM prompt to pull down the latest titles, summaries, publication dates, and canonical links. AI-based scraping is resilient to layout changes that regularly break CSS-selector scrapers, giving you long-term stability. The prompt also hard-codes a JSON schema so downstream nodes receive uniform structures regardless of agency quirks. Positioning the scraping layer here keeps the workflow modular: swap in new prompts or additional parsing logic without disturbing triggers or storage."

A **Merge Results** node waits for every branch, then passes everything to **Deduplicate Policies**, another Code node that removes duplicates based on the title so you never store the same regulation twice. Finally, the **Is New Policy?** IF node routes only fresh or updated items down the true path. This layered processing prevents alert fatigue and keeps Pipedrive lean by focusing on genuinely new content, while also providing a single choke point where you can plug in additional analytics—sentiment scoring, keyword filters, or severity ranking—without rewriting the entire workflow."

The **Prepare Matrix Message** Set node composes a concise alert containing the policy title, agency, publication date, and a direct link.

In parallel, the **Upsert Policy Deal** Pipedrive node logs a new deal for each policy item—allowing stakeholders to track implementation tasks, assign owners, and record follow-up actions right inside their CRM. Using Pipedrive instead of spreadsheets means policies become actionable objects that fit existing sales-style pipelines many health organizations already use for grant oversight and compliance projects. This dual path—instant visibility plus structured archiving—makes sure nothing slips through the cracks."
