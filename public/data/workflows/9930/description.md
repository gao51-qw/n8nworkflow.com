Automatically create, evaluate, and optimize professional biographies with the Bio-Graphy Agent.  
This workflow uses a multi-agent system powered by GPT-5 to write, review, and enhance bios — then saves the final version directly to Google Docs.

---

## Who’s it for
For professionals, creators, and marketers who want high-quality biographies for their profiles, portfolios, or LinkedIn — without spending hours writing or editing.

---

## How it works
1. The user sends a chat message with details like **name**, **age**, and **location**.  
2. The **Biography Agent** generates a complete biography using the GPT-5 Chat Model.  
3. The **Evaluator Agent** reviews the bio and provides structured feedback.  
4. The **Optimizer Agent** refines tone, structure, and clarity based on that feedback.  
5. The final biography is saved automatically to **Google Docs** for easy access or publishing.

## How to set up
1. Connect your **Google account** in n8n to enable document saving.  
2. Add your **OpenAI (GPT-5 or compatible)** credentials to the agent nodes.  
3. Customize prompts in the Biography, Evaluator, and Optimizer agents for your preferred writing style.  
4. Test the workflow by sending a chat message with basic personal details.  
5. Your completed bio will be generated, improved, and saved to your connected Google Docs.
