### How It Works
The core of the workflow is the AI Agent. It's connected to different data retrieval tools, to get data from Google Sheets (or your preferred database) in many different ways.

Once the data is retrieved, the Calculator tool allows the AI to perform mathematical operations, making your data analysis precise.
