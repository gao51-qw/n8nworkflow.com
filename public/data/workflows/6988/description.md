It supports both text and media messages, ensuring that customer conversations are centralized and accessible for support teams.

## What Problem Does This Solve?
Managing conversations across multiple platforms can lead to fragmented support and lost context.

It simplifies communication flow, centralizes conversations, and enhances the support team's productivity.

 - Designed to work with Evolution API webhooks or any message source

## Prerequisites
Before using this automate, make sure you have:

 - Evolution API credentials with incoming message webhook configured
 - A Chatwoot instance with access token and API endpoint
 - An existing Chatwoot inbox (preferably API channel)
 - A configured HTTP Request node in n8n for Chatwoot API calls

## Suggested Usage
This subworkflow should be attached to a parent workflow that receives WhatsApp messages via the Evolution API webhook. Ideal for:

Centralized customer service operations

WhatsApp-to-CRM/chat routing
