  "description": "## How to scrape emails from websites\n\nThis workflow will :\n- Try to find emails by scraping the website via http request\n- If no result is found, it will use [EmailListVerify email finder API](https://emaillistverify.com/email-finder-api) to guess an email address\n\nScraping email via http request is a cost-effective way to find email addresses, so it can save you a few bucks to use it before calling any email finder API.\n\n## Who is for\nThis workflow will help you transform a list of websites into a list of leads with email addresses. This is a handy workflow for any lead generation specialist.\n\nPay attention that this workflow will usually return only generic emails like \"contact@\". Those generic emails are useful when you target small businesses; the owner usually monitors those emails. However, I don't advise this workflow to target enterprise customers.\n\n# Requirements\n\nIn order to use this workflow, you will need:\n- To copy [this Google sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOTFM8UeWHhJbtBM7SRca6vsVJlRUXzX71kjJ8n2jUY/edit?gid=1538095319#gid=1538095319)\n- Get an API key for [EmailListVerify](https://emaillistverify.com/)\n\nYou then need to edit the setup of the 3 stages highlighted with a yellow sticky note, and you will be good to go.\n",
