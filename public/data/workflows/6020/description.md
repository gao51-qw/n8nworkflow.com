This advanced n8n automation template empowers your Slack bot to act as an intelligent assistant: when a user asks a question or requests a suggestion (by mentioning the bot), it automatically retrieves the user’s historical data and previous interactions from both Google Sheets and Pinecone. Using GPT-4o, the bot analyzes past updates, status reports, and context to generate a personalized, context-aware response—directly in Slack.
Perfect for teams seeking instant, data-driven support, this workflow transforms your Slack bot into a smart knowledge assistant that references your own organizational history to provide relevant answers and suggestions.
