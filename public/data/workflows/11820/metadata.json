  "description": "# WhatsApp AI Sales Agent using PDF Vector Store\n\nThis workflow turns your WhatsApp number into an intelligent AI-powered Sales Agent that answers product queries using real data extracted from a PDF brochure. It loads a product brochure via HTTP Request, converts it into embeddings using OpenAI, stores them in an in-memory vector store and allows the AI Agent to provide factual answers to users via WhatsApp. Non-text messages are filtered and only text queries are processed. This makes the workflow ideal for building a lightweight chatbot that understands your product documentation deeply.\n\n### Quick Start: 5-Step Fast Implementation\n\n1. **Insert your WhatsApp credentials** in the _WhatsApp Trigger_ and _WhatsApp Send_ nodes.\n2. **Add your OpenAI API Key** to all OpenAI-powered nodes.\n3. **Replace the PDF URL** in the _HTTP Request_ node with your own brochure.\n4. **Run the Manual Trigger once** to build the vector store.\n5. **Activate the workflow** and start chatting from WhatsApp.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow converts a product brochure (PDF) into a searchable knowledgebase using LangChain vector embeddings. Incoming WhatsApp messages are processed and if the message is text, the AI Sales Agent uses OpenAI + the vector store to produce accurate, brochure-based answers.\n\nThe AI responds naturally to customer queries, supports conversation memory across the session and retrieves information directly from the brochure when needed. Non-text messages are filtered out to maintain clean conversational flow.\n\nThe workflow is fully modular: you can replace the PDF, modify AI prompts, plug into CRM systems or extend it into a broader sales automation pipeline.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n- Businesses wanting a **WhatsApp-based AI customer assistant**.\n- Sales teams needing **automated product query handling**.\n- Companies with **large product catalog PDFs**.\n- Marketers wanting a **zero-code product brochure chatbot**.\n- Technical teams experimenting with **LangChain + OpenAI inside n8n**.\n\n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\nTo run this workflow successfully, you need:\n\n- An **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted).\n- A **WhatsApp Business API** connection.\n- An **OpenAI API key**.\n- A **publicly accessible PDF brochure URL**.\n- Basic familiarity with n8n node configuration.\n\nOptional:\n\n- A custom vector store backend (Qdrant, Pinecone) – the template uses in-memory storage.\n\n\n## How It Works & How To Set Up\n\n### 1. Import the Workflow JSON\n\nUpload the workflow JSON provided.\n\n### 2. Configure WhatsApp Trigger\n\n- Open **WhatsApp Trigger**\n- Add your WhatsApp credentials\n- Set the webhook correctly to match your n8n endpoint\n\n### 3. Configure WhatsApp Response Nodes\n\nThe workflow uses two WhatsApp send nodes:\n\n- **Reply To User** → Sends AI response\n- **Reply To User1** → Sends “unsupported message” reply\n\nAdd your WhatsApp credentials to both.\n\n### 4. Replace the PDF Brochure\n\nIn **get Product Brochure (HTTP Request)**:\n\n- Update the `url` parameter with your own PDF\n\n### 5. Run the PDF → Vector Store Setup (One-Time Only)\n\nUse the **Manual Trigger** (\"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\") to:\n\n- Download the PDF\n- Extract text\n- Split into chunks\n- Generate embeddings\n- Store them in **Product Catalogue** vector store\n\n&gt; You must run this once after importing the workflow.\n\n### 6. Set OpenAI Credentials\n\nAdd your OpenAI API Key to the following nodes:\n\n- `OpenAI Chat Model`\n- `OpenAI Chat Model1`\n- `Embeddings OpenAI`\n- `Embeddings OpenAI1`\n\n### 7. Review the AI Agent Prompt\n\nInside **AI Sales Agent**, you can edit the system message to match:\n\n- Your brand\n- Your product types\n- Your tone of voice\n\n### 8. Activate the Workflow\n\nOnce activated, WhatsApp users can chat with your AI Sales Agent.\n\n\n## How to Customize Nodes?\n\nHere are common customization options:\n\n### Customize the PDF / Knowledgebase\n\nChange the URL in **get Product Brochure**\n\nor\n\nUpload your own file via other nodes.\n\n### Customize AI Behavior\n\nEdit the **systemMessage** inside **AI Sales Agent**:\n\n- Change personality\n- Set product rules\n- Restrict/expand scope\n\n### Change Supported Message Types\n\nModify **Handle Message Types** switch logic to allow:\n\n- Image → OCR\n- Audio → Whisper\n- Documents → Additional processing\n\n### Modify WhatsApp Message Templates\n\nInside the `textBody` of response nodes.\n\n### Extend or replace Vector Store\n\nSwap `vectorStoreInMemory` with:\n\n- Qdrant\n- Pinecone\n- Redis vector store\n\nBy updating the vector store node.\n\n\n## Add-Ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\nYou can extend this workflow with:\n\n### 1. Multi-language support\n\nAdd OpenAI translation nodes before agent input.\n\n### 2. CRM Integration\n\nSend user queries and chat logs into:\n\n- HubSpot\n- Salesforce\n- Zoho CRM\n\n### 3. Product Recommendation Engine\n\nUse embeddings similarity to suggest products.\n\n### 4. Order Placement Workflow\n\nConnect to Stripe or Shopify APIs.\n\n### 5. Analytics Dashboard\n\nLog chats into Airtable / Postgres for analysis.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\nHere are some practical uses:\n\n1. **Product Inquiry Chatbot**\n   Customers ask about specs, pricing, or compatibility.\n\n2. **Digital Catalog Assistant**\n   Converts PDF brochures into interactive WhatsApp search.\n\n3. **Sales Support Bot**\n   Reduces load on human sales reps by handling common questions.\n\n4. **Internal Knowledge Bot**\n   Teams access manuals, training documents, or service guides.\n\n5. **Event/Product Launch Assistant**\n   Provides instant details about newly launched items.\n\nAnd many more similar use cases where an AI-powered WhatsApp assistant is valuable.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue                                      | Possible Cause                         | Solution                                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| WhatsApp messages not triggering workflow  | Wrong webhook URL or inactive workflow | Ensure webhook is correct & activate workflow                 |\n| AI replies are empty                       | Missing OpenAI credentials             | Add OpenAI API key to all AI nodes                            |\n| Vector store not populated                 | Manual trigger not executed            | Run the _Test Workflow_ trigger once                          |\n| PDF extraction returns blank text          | PDF is image-based                     | Use OCR before text splitting                                 |\n| “Unsupported message type” always triggers | Message type filter misconfigured      | Check conditions in _Handle Message Types_                    |\n| AI not using brochure data                 | VectorStore tool not linked properly   | Check connections between Embeddings → VectorStore → AI Agent |\n\n\n## Need Help with Support & Extensions?\n\nIf you need help setting up, customizing or extending this workflow, feel free to reach out to our n8n automation developers at WeblineIndia.
