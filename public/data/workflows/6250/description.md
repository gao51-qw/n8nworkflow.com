## 🚀 Detailed Workflow Operation

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Creation

1. **File Monitoring**: Two trigger nodes continuously monitor your Google Drive folder for new files or updates
2. **Document Discovery**: When changes are detected, the workflow searches for and identifies the modified files
3. **Content Extraction**: Downloads the actual file content from Google Drive
4. **Text Processing**: Uses LangChain's document loader to extract text from various file formats
5. **Intelligent Chunking**: Splits documents into overlapping chunks (configurable size) for optimal AI processing
6. **Vector Generation**: Creates embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
7. **Storage**: Stores vectors in an in-memory vector store for instant retrieval

### Phase 2: Chat Interaction

1. **Question Reception**: Webhook receives user questions in JSON format
2. **Data Extraction**: Parses incoming data to extract chat content and session information
3. **AI Processing**: AI Agent analyzes the question and determines relevant context
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Searches the vector store for the most relevant document sections
5. **Response Generation**: OpenAI generates responses based on found content and conversation history
6. **Authentication**: Validates the request using token-based authentication
7. **Response Delivery**: Sends the answer back to the originating platform

## 📚 Usage Instructions After Setup

### Adding Documents to Your Knowledge Base

1. **Upload Files**: Simply drag and drop documents into your configured Google Drive folder
2. **Supported Formats**: PDFs, TXT, DOC, DOCX, and other text-based formats
3. **Automatic Processing**: The workflow will automatically detect and process new files within minutes
4. **Updates**: Modify existing files, and the knowledge base will automatically update

### Integrating with Your Chat Platform

**Webhook URL**: Use the generated webhook URL to send questions
```
POST https://your-n8n-domain/webhook/your-custom-path
Content-Type: application/json

{
"body": {
"Data": {
"ChatMessage": {
"Content": "What are your business hours?",
"RoomId": "user-123-session",
"Platform": "web",
