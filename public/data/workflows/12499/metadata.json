This workflow scans Hacker News discussions (Show HN, launches, AI, startups, SaaS), filters out noise and non-discussion pages, and extracts only high-signal threads. AI then converts these discussions into a concise, founder-ready daily digest highlighting key trends, why they matter, and practical actions. The digest is delivered via email, while structured insights are logged to Google Sheets for long-term tracking and analysis. \n## ⚠️ Deployment Disclaimer\n This template is designed for self-hosted n8n installations only.\n It relies on external MCP tools and custom AI orchestration that are not supported on n8n Cloud.\n\n## 🔄 What This Template Does\n 1️⃣ Runs automatically on a daily schedule ⏰\n 2️⃣ Searches Hacker News discussions via Google using SerpAPI 🔍\n 3️⃣ Extracts titles, summaries, links, and metadata from results 📄\n 4️⃣ Filters out guidelines, index pages, and non-discussion links 🚫\n 5️⃣ Aggregates valid discussion threads into a single dataset 📦\n 6️⃣ Uses AI to identify key trends, problems, and founder-relevant signals 🧠\n 7️⃣ Generates a concise daily founder digest (trend, why it matters, actions) ✍️\n 8️⃣ Sends the digest automatically via email 📧\n 9️⃣ Cleans and normalizes insights for storage 🧹\n 🔟 Appends structured founder intelligence to Google Sheets for tracking 📊\n## ✅ Key Benefits\n ✅ Eliminates manual Hacker News scanning\n ✅ Surfaces only high-signal, founder-relevant discussions\n ✅ Converts raw discussions into clear, actionable insights\n ✅ Delivers a daily, skimmable founder digest automatically\n ✅ Builds a historical intelligence log in Google Sheets\n ✅ Creates a repeatable founder research workflow\n## ⚙️ Features\n - Daily scheduled execution\n - Hacker News discovery via Google Search (SerpAPI)\n - Noise filtering with custom JavaScript logic\n - AI-powered trend and insight extraction\n - Founder-focused digest generation\n - Email delivery via Gmail\n - Insight archiving in Google Sheets\n## 🔑 Requirements\n - SerpAPI account\n - Azure OpenAI credentials\n - Gmail account connected to n8n\n - Google Sheets account\n - Self-hosted n8n instance\n## 🎯 Target Audience\n - Startup founders tracking early signals\n - Product and growth leaders monitoring trends\n - VCs and analysts scouting emerging tools\n - Teams needing automated market and founder intelligence",
