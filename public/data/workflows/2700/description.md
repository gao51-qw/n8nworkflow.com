### Video Guide

I prepared a detailed guide that shows the entire process of building an AI agent that integrates with Airtable data in n8n. This template covers everything from data preparation to advanced configurations.

### Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for developers, data analysts, and business owners who want to create an AI-powered conversational agent integrated with Airtable datasets. It is particularly useful for users looking to enhance data interaction through chat interfaces.

### What problem does this workflow solve?
Engaging with data stored in Airtable often requires manual navigation and time-consuming searches. This workflow allows users to interact conversationally with their datasets, retrieving essential information quickly while minimizing the need for complex queries.

### What this workflow does
This workflow enables an AI agent to facilitate chat interactions over Airtable data. The agent can:
- Retrieve order records, product details, and other relevant data.
- Execute mathematical functions to analyze data such as calculating averages and totals.
- Optionally generate maps for geographic data visualization.

1. **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: The agent uses user prompts to dynamically query the dataset.
2. **Memory Management**: It retains context during conversations, allowing users to engage in a more natural dialogue.
3. **Search and Filter Capabilities**: Users can perform tailored searches with specific parameters or filters to refine their results.

### Set up steps

1. **Separate workflows**:
	- Create additional workflow and move there Workflow 2.

2. **Replace credentials**:
	- Replace connections and credentials in all nodes.

3. **Start chat**:
	- Ask questions and don't forget to mention required base name.
