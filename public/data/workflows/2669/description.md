This workflow creates a documentation system for n8n instances using Docsify.js. It serves a dynamic documentation website that allows users to:

- View an overview of all workflows in a tabular format
- Filter workflows by tags
- Access automatically generated documentation for each workflow
- Edit documentation with a live Markdown preview
- Visualize workflow structures using Mermaid.js diagrams
