## Lead Scoring Logic

| Factor | Points | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Base | 50 | Starting point |

| Rating 4-5 | +20 | High interest |
| Rating 1-2 | -20 | Low interest |
| No Buyer Agreement | +10 | Not contractually bound |

## Email Personalization

**With Agent:**

## Error Handling

**No Email Provided:**
- Cannot create HubSpot contact (email required)
- Lead logged to error output
- Can connect to Google Sheets or alert system
- Recommendation: Make email required in SignSnap

---

## Customization Ideas

1. **Auto-assign to agent** - Match property to territory
2. **Create deals** - Automatic deal creation for HOT leads
3. **Add to lists** - Property-specific list segmentation
4. **Trigger workflows** - HubSpot nurture sequences
5. **SMS follow-up** - Add Twilio for text messages
6. **Photo upload** - Attach guest photos to contacts

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid email"** - Check SignSnap email validation  
**"Property doesn't exist"** - Create custom property or remove from config  
**"Authentication failed"** - Reconnect HubSpot OAuth2  
**"No contacts appearing"** - Check execution history, verify email provided  
**"Email not sending"** - Verify SMTP credentials and FROM address
