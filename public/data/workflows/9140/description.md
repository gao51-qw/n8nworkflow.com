## Description
This workflow automates personalized candidate communication for both shortlisted and rejected applicants. It fetches candidate details, processes resumes, checks for errors, and uses GPT-4o to generate professional HTML emails. Shortlisted candidates receive congratulatory onboarding plans, while rejected candidates receive polite rejections with learning resources.

## What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)

-  📥 Resume Downloader (Google Drive) – Downloads candidate resumes from sheet links.
-  ✅ Resume File Check (If Condition) – Ensures the resume file is valid before proceeding.
-  ⚠️ Error Logging (Google Sheets) – Records failed or missing resumes in a dedicated sheet for audit.
-  📄 PDF → Text Extractor – Extracts raw resume text for deeper AI analysis.
-  🧩 Candidate Data Builder (Code Node) – Combines Google Sheets data with extracted resume text into a single enriched JSON object.
