## How It Works
This workflow automates comprehensive real estate investment analysis by orchestrating specialized AI agents to evaluate property data, market trends, and financial metrics. Designed for real estate investors, portfolio managers, and property analysts managing multiple properties or evaluating acquisition opportunities, it eliminates the manual research and analysis that typically requires days of work across multiple data sources. The system aggregates data from real estate APIs, market databases, and local statistics, then deploys specialized agents: performance analysis evaluates ROI and cash flow, recommendation engines identify optimal properties, market analysis assesses location trends, sentiment analysis mines reviews and local feedback, and workflow tools calculate financial projections. An orchestrator coordinates these agents to generate consolidated investment reports with property rankings, risk assessments, and portfolio recommendations. Results populate Google Sheets dashboards and trigger email notifications, transforming weeks of analysis into automated insights delivered in hours.
