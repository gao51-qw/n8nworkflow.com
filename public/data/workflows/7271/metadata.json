  "description": "**Reimbursements used to be a headache.**\n\nEmployees submitted receipts through emails, managers got stuck in approval chains, and finance teams spent hours checking for duplicates, updating sheets, and sending follow-up emails.\n\n**So, we automated it.**\n\nUsing n8n, we built a smart Employee Reimbursement Workflow that does everything… in just a few clicks.\n\n**Here’s how it works.**]\nWhen an employee uploads a receipt, the workflow first checks for duplicates.\nIf the file is new, it’s uploaded to Google Drive instantly.\nNext, a unique tracking ID is generated—no manual typing, no mistakes.\nThen, all the details are logged in Google Sheets in real time, ready for records.\nAnd finally, the Finance team gets an email notification with everything they need to process the payment—no chasing, no missing info.\n\n**The impact?**\nWe’ve cut processing time by over 70%, reduced errors to nearly zero, and made the entire process stress-free for employees and finance alike.\n\nThis isn’t just automation—it’s giving people their time back.\n\n\n![Screenshot 20250805 152900.png](fileId:2049)",
