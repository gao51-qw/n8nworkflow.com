  "description": "## How It Works\nA scheduled trigger initiates automated retrieval of TOTO/4D data, including both current and historical records. The datasets are merged and validated to ensure structural consistency before branching into parallel analytical pipelines. One track performs pattern mining and anomaly detection, while the other generates statistical and time-series forecasts. Results are then routed to an AI agent that integrates multi-model insights, evaluates prediction confidence, and synthesizes the final output. The system formats the results and delivers them through the selected export channel.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n**1. Scheduler Config:** Adjust the trigger frequency (daily or weekly).\n**2. Data Sources:** Configure API endpoints or database connectors for TOTO/4D retrieval.\n**3. Data Mapping:** Align and map column structures for both 1D and 4D datasets in merge nodes.\n**4. AI Integration:** Insert the OpenAI API key and connect the required model nodes.\n**5. Export Paths:** Select and configure output channels (email, Google Sheets, webhook, or API).\n\n## Prerequisites\n- TOTO/4D historical data source with API access\n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 recommended)\n- n8n environment with HTTP/database connectivity\n- Basic time series analysis knowledge\n\n## Use Cases\n**Traders:** Pattern recognition for draw prediction with confidence scoring  \n**Analysts:** Multivariate forecasting across cycles with validation  \n\n## Customization\n**Data:** Swap TOTO/4D with stock prices, crypto, sensors, or any time series  \n**Models:** Replace OpenAI with Claude, local LLMs, or HuggingFace models  \n\n## Benefits\n**Automation:** Runs 24/7 without manual intervention  \n**Intelligence:** Ensemble approach prevents overfitting and single-model bias  \n\n",
