  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nSocial-media managers and brands that want to keep their Instagram\naccounts active by automatically liking fresh posts under selected\nhashtags—hands-free and rate-limited.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs every 2 hours at a specified minute.  \n2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating Instagram session-cookie\n   (time-slice logic).  \n3. **Generate Random Hashtag** (GPT-4o) outputs a realistic AI/BPA\n   hashtag.  \n4. **Instagram Hashtag Agent** (Phantombuster) scrapes up to\n   `ENV_MAX_POSTS_PER_HASHTAG` recent posts.  \n5. **Get Random Post** selects one; **duplicate checker** ensures it\n   hasn’t been liked before (SharePoint CSV).  \n6. Builds `instagram_posts_to_like.csv`, uploads to SharePoint, then\n   launches the **Auto-like Agent** which likes the post.  \n7. Post URL is appended to `instagram_posts_already_liked.csv` to avoid\n   duplicates.  \n8. **Wait** nodes throttle launches to ~12 likes per profile daily.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API\n   key.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  \n   • `instagram_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n   • `instagram_posts_already_liked.csv` with header `postUrl`.  \n3. Adjust **Set ENV Variables** to change max posts per scrape.  \n4. Activate the workflow; it will like one post every 2 hours.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- OpenAI account\n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Target a different niche: edit hashtag prompt in **Generate Random Hashtag**.  \n- Like more posts: raise `ENV_MAX_POSTS_PER_HASHTAG`,\n  `numberOfPostsPerLaunch`, or schedule frequency.  \n- Replace SharePoint with Drive/Dropbox by swapping storage nodes.",
