## Summary
Every day at a set time, this workflow fetches yesterday’s newsletters from Gmail, summarizes each email into concise topics with an LLM, merges all topics, renders a clean HTML digest, and emails it to your inbox.

## What this workflow does
-  Triggers on a daily schedule (default 16:00, server time)
-  Fetches Gmail messages since yesterday using a custom search query with optional sender filters
-  Retrieves and decodes each email’s HTML, subject, sender name, and date
-  Prompts an LLM (GPT‑4.1‑mini) to produce a consistent JSON summary of topics per email
-  Merges topics from all emails into a single list
-  Renders a styled HTML email with enumerated items
-  Sends the HTML digest to a specified recipient via Gmail

## Apps and credentials
-  Gmail OAuth2: Gmail account (read and send)
-  OpenAI: OpenAi account

## Typical use cases
-  Daily/weekly newsletter rollups delivered as one email
-  Curated digests from specific media or authors
-  Team briefings that are easy to read and forward

## How it works (node-by-node)
-  Schedule Trigger
  	- Fires at the configured hour (default 16:00).
-  Get many messages (Gmail → getAll, returnAll: true)
  	- Uses a filter like:
    =(from:____@____.com) OR (from:____@____.com) OR (from:____@____.com -"____") after:{{ $now.minus({ days: 1 }).toFormat('yyyy/MM/dd') }}
  	- Returns a list of message IDs from the past day.
-  Loop Over Items (Split in Batches)
  	- Iterates through each message ID.
-  Get a message (Gmail → get)
  	- Retrieves the full message/payload for the current email.
-  Get message data (Code)
  	- Extracts HTML from Gmail’s MIME parts.
  	- Normalizes the sender to just the display name.
 	 - Formats the date as DD.MM.YYYY.
 	 - Passes html, subject, from, date forward.
-  Clean (Code)
  	- Converts DD.MM.YYYY → MM.DD (for prompt brevity).
  	- Passes html, subject, from, date to the LLM.
-  Message a model (OpenAI, model: gpt‑4.1‑mini, JSON output)
  	- Prompt instructs:
    		- Produce JSON: { "topics": [ { "title", "descr", "subject", "from", "date" } ] }
   		 - Split multi-news blocks into separate topics
    		- Combine or ignore specific blocks for particular senders (placeholders ____)
   		 - Keep subject untranslated; other values in ____ language
    		- Injects subject/from/date/html from the current email
-  Loop Over Items (continues)
 	 - Processes all emails for the time window.
-  Merge (Code)
  	- Flattens the topics arrays from all processed emails into one combined topics list.
-  Create template (Code)
  	- Builds a complete HTML email:
    		- Enumerated items with title, one-line description
    		- Original subject and “from — date”
    		- Safely escapes HTML and preserves line breaks
    		- Inline, email-friendly styles
-  Send a message (Gmail → send)
  	- Sends the final HTML to your recipient with a custom subject.

|---|---|---|
| Schedule Trigger | Trigger | Run at a specific time each day |
| Get many messages | Gmail (getAll) | Search emails since yesterday with filters |
| Loop Over Items | Split in Batches | Iterate messages one-by-one |
| Get a message | Gmail (get) | Fetch full message payload |
| Get message data | Code | Extract HTML/subject/from/date; normalize sender and date |
| Clean | Code | Reformat date and forward fields to LLM |
| Message a model | OpenAI | Summarize email into JSON topics |

Before you start
-  Connect Gmail OAuth2 in n8n (ensure it has both read and send permissions)
-  Add your OpenAI API key
-  Import the provided workflow JSON into n8n

Setup instructions
1) Schedule
-  Schedule Trigger node:
  - Set your preferred hour (server time). Default is 16:00.

2) Gmail
-  Get many messages:
  	- Adjust filters.q to your senders/labels and window:
    		- Example: =(from:news@publisher.com) OR (from:briefs@media.com -"promo") after:{{ $now.minus({ days: 1 }).toFormat('yyyy/MM/dd') }}
  	- You can use label: or category: to narrow scope.
-  Send a message:
  	- sendTo = your email
  	- subject = your subject line
  	- message = set to {{ $json.htmlBody }} (already produced by Create template)
 	 - The HTML body uses inline styles for broad email client support.

3) OpenAI
-  Message a model:
  	- Model: gpt‑4.1‑mini (swap to gpt‑4o‑mini or your preferred)
  	- Update prompt placeholders:
    		- ____ language → your target language
   		 - ____ sender rules → special cases (combine blocks, ignore sections)

## How to use
-  The workflow runs daily at the scheduled time, compiling a digest from yesterday’s emails.
-  You’ll receive one HTML email with all topics neatly listed.
-  Adjust the time window or filters to change what gets included.

## Customization ideas
-  Time window control:
  	- after: {{ $now.minus({ days: X }) }} and/or add before:
-  Filter by labels:
  	- q = label:Newsletters after:{{ $now.minus({ days: 1 }).toFormat('yyyy/MM/dd') }}
-  Language:
  	- Set the ____ language in the LLM prompt
-  Template:
  	- Edit “Create template” to add a header, footer, hero section, logo/branding
  	- Include links parsed from HTML (add an HTML parser step in “Get message data”)
-  Subject line:
  	- Make dynamic, e.g., “Digest for {{ $now.toFormat('dd.MM.yyyy') }}”
-  Sender:
  	- Use a dedicated Gmail account or alias for deliverability and separation

## Limits and notes
-  Gmail size limit for outgoing emails is ~25 MB; large digests may need pruning
-  LLM usage incurs cost and latency proportional to email size and count
-  HTML rendering varies across clients; inline styles are used for compatibility
-  Schedule uses the n8n server’s timezone; adjust if your server runs in a different TZ

## Privacy and safety
-  Emails are sent to OpenAI for summarization—ensure this aligns with your data policies
-  Limit the Gmail search scope to only the newsletters you want processed
-  Avoid including sensitive emails in the search window

## Sample output (email body)
-  Title 1
  	- One-sentence description
  	- Original Subject
 	 - → Sender — DD.MM.YYYY
-  Title 2
 	 - One-sentence description
 	 - Original Subject
 	 - → Sender — DD.MM.YYYY

## Tips and troubleshooting
-  No emails found? Check filters.q and the time window (after:)
-  Model returns empty JSON? Simplify the prompt or try another model
-  Odd characters in output? The template escapes HTML and preserves line breaks; verify your input encoding
-  Delivery issues? Use a verified sender, set a clear subject, and avoid spammy keywords
