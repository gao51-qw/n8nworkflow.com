  "description": "**🚨 DISCLAIMER (READ FIRST):**\n\nThis workflow is **NOT HIPAA-compliant** and **NOT intended for production use**.\nIt is a **test/demo prototype** built for experimentation, education, and non-clinical evaluation purposes only.\n\nIt does **not include encryption**, **does not meet any regulatory standards**, and **must not be used with real patient data or PHI** (Protected Health Information).\n\nThe creator is **not liable** for any misuse or damage caused by deploying this workflow in a real-world or clinical environment.\n\n---\n\n🎥 **Watch the Workflow Demo:** [https://youtu.be/1qt3sU2o4_Y?si=oA1CizPaO66_tKnc](https://youtu.be/1qt3sU2o4_Y?si=oA1CizPaO66_tKnc)\n\n**🔧 Workflow Summary:**\nThis n8n workflow mimics a lightweight AI assistant for healthcare clinics by automatically analyzing patient symptoms and booking appointments. It uses no-code tools and basic AI integration to demonstrate automation potential in medical triage.\n\n---\n\n**🩺 What it does:**\n\n1. **Patient submits a form** (Cal.com or webhook) with name, contact, and symptoms\n2. **AI processes the symptoms** (via OpenRouter) and suggests the likely issue\n3. **AI assigns a relevant department** like Ortho, Neuro, etc.\n4. **Books the appointment** on the correct Google Calendar (department-wise)\n5. **Saves the patient info** to a Google Sheet for tracking\n6. **Skips duplicate appointments** for the same patient (based on name or contact)\n\n---\n\n**📦 Tools Used:**\n• n8n (Cloud or Self-Hosted)\n• OpenRouter (GPT-based AI model)\n• Cal.com (Booking system)\n• Google Calendar\n• Google Sheets\n\n---\n\n**⚠️ For a HIPAA-Compliant Version (Future-Ready Notes):**\n\n* Self-host n8n to avoid vendor lock-in or BAA issues\n* Run LLMs locally (LLaMA, Mistral) instead of APIs\n* Replace Cal.com with a self-hosted calendar/booking tool\n* Use end-to-end encryption for PHI transmission\n* Store data in encrypted Postgres (with pgcrypto or similar)\n* Implement access control and audit logging\n* AND MANY MORE.... REFER/CONSULT RESPECTIVE AUTHORITIES FOR MORE INFO\n\n---\n\n**💡 Use Case:**\nThis demo can help founders, developers, or healthtech explorers prototype AI-assisted clinic systems without writing code — but again, strictly for mock/demo workflows only.",
