  "description": "## Automatically BackUp Your n8n Workflows to OneDrive\n\nThis workflow automates the backup of your self-hosted n8n instance by exporting all workflows and saving them as individual `.json` files to a designated OneDrive folder. Each file is timestamped for easy versioning and audit tracking.\n\nAfter a successful backup, the workflow optionally cleans up old backup files and sends a confirmation email to notify you that the process completed.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Uses the **HTTP Request** node to fetch all workflows via the `/rest/workflows` API.\n2. Iterates through each workflow using **SplitInBatches**.\n3. Converts each workflow to a `.json` file using **Set** and **Function** nodes.\n4. Uploads each file to a target **Microsoft OneDrive** folder using OAuth2.\n5. Deletes old backup files from OneDrive after upload, with the option to keep backups for a configurable number of time.\n6. Sends an email notification once all backups have completed successfully.\n\n## Setup instructions\n\n- Enter your **n8n Base URL** and authentication details in the HTTP Request node.\n- Set up **Microsoft OneDrive OAuth2** credentials for cloud upload.\n- Configure the **Email node** with SMTP credentials to receive backup confirmation.\n- (Optional) Adjust the file retention logic to keep backups for a set duration.\n- A **Cron** trigger to schedule the workflow automatically (e.g., daily or weekly).\n\n👉 Sticky notes inside the workflow explain each step for easy setup.\n\n## Need Help\n\n- ## Need Help\n🔗 [LinkedIn – Wessel Bulte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wessel-bulte/)",
