  "description": "## Overview\n- This workflow provides Retell agent builders with a simple way to populate [dynamic variables](https://docs.retellai.com/build/dynamic-variables) using n8n.\n- The workflow fetches user information from a Google Sheet based on the phone number and sends it back to Retell.\n- It is based on Retell's [Inbound Webhook Call](https://docs.retellai.com/features/inbound-call-webhook).\n- Retell is a service that lets you create Voice Agents that handle voice calls simply, based on a prompt or using a conversational flow builder.\n\n## Who is it for\nFor builders of [Retell's](https://www.retellai.com/) Voice Agents who want to make their agents more personalized.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Have a [Retell AI Account](https://www.retellai.com/)\n- [Create a Retell agent](https://docs.retellai.com/get-started/quick-start)\n- [Purchase a phone number](https://docs.retellai.com/deploy/purchase-number) and associate it with your agent\n- Create a Google Sheets - for example, [make a copy of this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TYgk8PK5w2l8Q5NtepdyLvgtuHXBHcODy-2hXOPP6AU/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Your Google Sheet must have at least one column with the phone number. The remaining columns will be used to populate your Retell agent’s dynamic variables.\n- All fields are returned as strings to Retell (variables are replaced as text)\n\n## How it works\n- The webhook call is received from Retell. We filter the call using their whitelisted IP address.\n- It extracts data from the webhook call and uses it to retrieve the user from Google Sheets.\n- It formats the data in the response to match Retell's expected format.\n- Retell uses this data to replace [dynamic variables](https://docs.retellai.com/build/dynamic-variables#dynamic-variables) in the prompts.\n\n\n## How to use it\nSee the description for screenshots!\n- Set the webhook name (keep it as POST).\n- Copy the Webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/retell-dynamic-variables`) and paste it into Retell's interface. Navigate to \"Phone Numbers\", click on the phone number, and enable \"Add an inbound webhook\".\n![Screenshot 20250331 at 16.38.06.png](fileId:1075)\n\n- In your prompt (e.g., \"welcome message\"), use the variable with this syntax: `{{variable_name}}` (see [Retell's documentation](https://docs.retellai.com/build/dynamic-variables)).\n![image.png](fileId:1074)\n\n- These variables will be dynamically replaced by the data in your Google Sheet.\n\n\n## Notes\n- In Google Sheets, the phone number must start with `'+`.\n- Phone numbers must be formatted like the example: with the `+`, extension, and no spaces.\n- You can use any database—just replace Google Sheets with your own, making sure to keep the phone number formatting consistent.\n\n#### 👉 [Reach out to us](mailto:hello@agentstudio.io) if you're interested in **analysing your Retell Agent conversations**.\n",
