  "title": "WooCommerce AI post-sales chatbot with GPT-4o, RAG, Google Drive and Telegram",
  "description": "This **WooCommerce-integrated chatbot** is designed to transform post-sales customer support by combining automation and artificial intelligence to deliver fast, secure, and personalized assistance. \n\nThe chatbot **retrieves real-time order information, including shipping details and tracking numbers,** after verifying the customer's identity through a strict email-based authentication system.\n\nBeyond order management, the chatbot answers frequently asked questions about return policies, delivery times, and terms of service using **RAG**. \n\nIf a request is too complex, the system seamlessly **escalates it to a human operator via Telegram**, guaranteeing no customer query goes unresolved. \n\n---\n\n#### **Key Features of the Chatbot**  \n1. **Order Tracking**: Retrieves real-time tracking information for WooCommerce orders, including carrier URLs and pickup dates.  \n2. **Order Details Retrieval**: Provides customers with past/current order information after strict email verification.  \n3. **Policy & FAQ Assistance**: Answers questions about shipping, returns, and store policies using a vectorized knowledge base (ToS tool).  \n4. **Identity Verification**: Ensures privacy by requiring exact email-order matches before sharing sensitive data.  \n5. **Human Escalation**: Transfers complex issues to human agents via Telegram when the AI cannot resolve them.  \n6. **Context-Aware Conversations**: Maintains dialogue context using memory buffers for seamless interactions.  \n---\n\n\n#### **Who Benefits from This Chatbot?**  \n1. **E-commerce Stores**: WooCommerce businesses needing 24/7 automated post-sales support.  \n2. **Customer Support Teams**: Reduces ticket volume by handling repetitive queries (tracking, policies).  \n3. **SMBs**: Small-to-medium businesses lacking resources for full-time support staff.  \n4. **Customers**: Shoppers who want instant, self-service access to order status and FAQs.  \n\n---\n\n#### **How It Works**  \n1. **Customer Interaction**: The workflow starts when a customer sends a chat message, triggering the AI agent.  \n2. **Identity Verification**: The agent requests the order number and associated email, strictly verifying the match before proceeding.  \n3. **Order & Tracking Retrieval**: Using WooCommerce API tools (`get_order`, `get_tracking`), it fetches order details and tracking information.  \n4. **Policy & Support**: The `ToS` tool answers shipping and policy questions, while `human_assistance` escalates unresolved issues to a human agent via Telegram.  \n5. **Memory & Context**: A buffer memory retains conversation context for coherent interactions.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Configure Qdrant Vector Store**: Replace `QDRANTURL` and `COLLECTION` in the nodes to set up document storage.  \n2. **Add Telegram Chat ID**: Insert your Telegram `CHAT_ID` in the `human_assistance` node for escalations.  \n3. **Integrate WooCommerce Tracking Plugin**: Install the YITH WooCommerce Order Tracking plugin and update the HTTP request URL in the tracking node.  \n4. **Test & Activate**: Verify the workflow by testing order queries and ensuring proper email verification.  \n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
