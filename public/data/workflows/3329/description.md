This **WooCommerce-integrated chatbot** is designed to transform post-sales customer support by combining automation and artificial intelligence to deliver fast, secure, and personalized assistance. 

The chatbot **retrieves real-time order information, including shipping details and tracking numbers,** after verifying the customer's identity through a strict email-based authentication system.

Beyond order management, the chatbot answers frequently asked questions about return policies, delivery times, and terms of service using **RAG**. 

If a request is too complex, the system seamlessly **escalates it to a human operator via Telegram**, guaranteeing no customer query goes unresolved.
