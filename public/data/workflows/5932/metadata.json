  "description": "# **Automation Flow: Image to Image Using GPT Sora**\n\nThis flow automates the process of generating images using a provided prompt and reference image via the **Sora GPT Image API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-gpt-image). The generated images are stored in **Google Drive**, and details are logged in **Google Sheets**.\n\n## **Nodes Overview**\n\n### 1. **On Form Submission**\n- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger`\n- **Description**: This node triggers when a user submits the form containing the prompt and image URL. It ensures the form fields are filled in and ready for processing.\n  - **Form Fields**:\n    - **Prompt**: A text description of the desired image.\n    - **Image URL**: The URL of the reference image to be used.\n  - **Webhook ID**: Unique identifier for form submission.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **HTTP Request to Sora GPT Image API**\n- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`\n- **Description**: Sends the prompt and image URL to the **Sora GPT Image API** to generate a new image based on the provided inputs.\n  - **API Endpoint**: [Sora GPT Image API](https://sora-gpt-image.p.rapidapi.com/ai-img/img-to-img.php) (via **RapidAPI**)\n  - **Method**: `POST`\n  - **Body Parameters**:\n    - **Prompt**: User-provided text.\n    - **Image URL**: The reference image URL.\n    - **Width & Height**: Image size is set to `1024x1024`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Code (Base64 Conversion)**\n- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.code`\n- **Description**: This node processes the base64-encoded image data returned from the API. It decodes and formats the image to be uploaded to Google Drive.\n  - **Output**: Converts the base64 string into a binary JPEG file.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Upload Image to Google Drive**\n- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive`\n- **Description**: Uploads the generated image to **Google Drive**, storing it in a designated folder.\n  - **Authentication**: Google Service Account.\n  - **File Name**: The image file name is dynamically set from the previous node.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Log Details to Google Sheets**\n- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets`\n- **Description**: This node logs the **Prompt**, **Generated Image**, and **Generation Date** into a **Google Sheets** document for tracking and auditing purposes.\n  - **Columns Mapped**:\n    - **Prompt**: The user’s input text.\n    - **Image**: The name of the generated image file.\n    - **Generated Date**: Date and time of image generation.\n\n---\n\n## **Flow Summary**\n1. **User Submits Form**: Triggered when the form with the prompt and image URL is submitted.\n2. **Image Generation**: The data is sent to the **Sora GPT Image API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-gpt-image) to generate the image.\n3. **Image Processing**: The generated image (base64 format) is decoded and saved as a file.\n4. **Google Drive Upload**: The image is uploaded to **Google Drive** for storage.\n5. **Google Sheets Logging**: All relevant details (Prompt, Image, Date) are saved in **Google Sheets**.\n\n---\n\n## **Benefits**\n- **Automated Image Creation**: Quickly generate images using AI based on a simple prompt and reference image via **RapidAPI**.\n- **Efficient Workflow**: The entire process from form submission to image generation and storage is automated, saving time and reducing manual work.\n- **Centralized Storage**: Generated images are stored in **Google Drive**, ensuring easy access and organization.\n- **Audit Trail**: The details of each generated image are logged in **Google Sheets**, making it easy to track, review, and manage past creations.\n- **Scalable and Reusable**: Can be adapted to multiple use cases, such as creative design, marketing materials, or social media content generation.\n\n---\n\n## **Problems Solved**\n- **Manual Image Editing**: Eliminates the need for manual image manipulation and creation, allowing for automatic generation based on user inputs.\n- **Disorganized File Storage**: With automatic uploads to **Google Drive**, the images are stored in a centralized and organized manner.\n- **Lack of Record-Keeping**: By logging image generation details in **Google Sheets**, there's always a record of past creations, improving tracking and management.\n- **Time-Consuming Processes**: The automation drastically reduces the time spent on manual tasks, allowing users to focus on other aspects of their work or creative processes.\n\n---\n\nThis flow simplifies the process of creating AI-generated images based on user inputs, leveraging the power of the **Sora GPT Image API** via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-gpt-image), making it a powerful tool for creative, design, and marketing purposes.\n",
