🚀 GitHub MCP Webhook Tool Sub-workflow: AI-Powered Repo Assistant

&gt; Transform your GitHub workflows with a customizable AI agent that integrates seamlessly via a single webhook. Think "Copilot for repos," but you own the code, prompts, and data.

👀 Key Features

    🔧 Fully Customizable: Tweak system prompts, swap AI models (GPT-4o, 4o-mini), or add tools like spam detection.

    📦 Single Webhook Integration: Add AI to any existing workflow with 1 HTTP node.

    🤖 Auto-Triage & Action: Sort issues by severity, auto-comment, flag spam (e.g., NSFW content), and ping teams via Discord/Slack.

    🔍 Codebase-Aware: Queries your repo’s docs and code for context-aware responses (Pinecone vector stores optional).

    💸 Cost-Friendly: Starts at $1 – cheaper than a coffee, infinitely more useful.

🛠️ Getting Started

    🚀 Deploy the Template: Clone the "GitHub MCP Server" workflow.

    🔑 Set Variables: Update repoOwner, repoName, and Discord/Slack IDs in the "CHANGE THESE!!!" node.

    🌲 Pinecone Setup: Pre-index your docs/code for lightning-fast queries using the vector nodes.

    🌍 Go Live: Trigger via webhook – use it for issue replies, triage, or even automated PR drafts!

💡 Use Cases

    🚨 Auto-Alert Teams: Flag critical bugs to senior devs, route FAQs to interns.

    🗑️ Spam Shield: Delete explicit issues instantly, quarantine self-promo for review.

    📝 Docs Bot: Answer contributor questions using your repo’s documentation.
