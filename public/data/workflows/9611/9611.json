    "description": "This workflow automates the process of analyzing a contract submitted via a web form. It extracts the text from an uploaded PDF, uses AI to identify potential red flags, and sends a summary report to a Telegram chat.\n\n***\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you can use this workflow, you'll need a few things set up.\n\n### 1. JotForm Form\nYou need to create a form in JotForm with at least two specific fields:\n* **Email Address**: A standard field to collect the user's email.\n* **File Upload**: This field will be used to upload the contract or NDA. Make sure to configure it to allow `.pdf` files.\n\n\n\n### 2. API Keys and IDs\n* **JotForm API Key**: You can generate this from your JotForm account settings under the \"API\" section.\n* **Gemini API Key**: You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio to use the Gemini model.\n* **Telegram Bot Token**: Create a new bot by talking to the `@BotFather` on Telegram. It will give you a unique token.\n* **Telegram Chat ID**: This is the ID of the user, group, or channel you want the bot to send messages to. You can get this by using a bot like `@userinfobot`.\n\n***\n## Node-by-Node Explanation\n\nHere is a breakdown of what each node in the workflow does, in the order they execute.\n\n### 1. JotForm Trigger\n* **What it does**: This node kicks off the entire workflow. It actively listens for new submissions on the specific JotForm you select.\n* **How it works**: When someone fills out your form and hits \"Submit,\" JotForm sends the submission data (including the email and a link to the uploaded file) to this node.\n\n### 2. Grab Attachment Details (HTTP Request)\n* **What it does**: The initial data from JotForm doesn't contain a direct download link for the file. This node takes the `submissionID` from the trigger and makes a request to the JotForm API to get the full details of that submission.\n* **How it works**: It constructs a URL using the `submissionID` and your JotForm API key to fetch the submission data, which includes the proper download URL for the uploaded contract.\n\n### 3. Grab the Attached Contract (HTTP Request)\n* **What it does**: Now that it has the direct download link, this node fetches the actual PDF file.\n* **How it works**: It uses the file URL obtained from the previous node to download the contract. The node is set to expect a \"file\" as the response, so it saves the PDF data in binary format for the next step.\n\n### 4. Extract Text from PDF File\n* **What it does**: This node takes the binary PDF data from the previous step and extracts all the readable text from it.\n* **How it works**: It processes the PDF and outputs plain text, stripping away any formatting or images. This raw text is now ready to be analyzed by the AI.\n\n### 5. AI Agent (with Google Gemini Chat Model)\n* **What it does**: This is the core analysis engine of the workflow. It takes the extracted text from the PDF and uses a powerful prompt to analyze it. The \"Google Gemini Chat Model\" node is connected as its \"brain.\"\n* **How it works**:\n    * It sends the contract text to the Gemini model.\n    * The prompt instructs Gemini to act as an expert contract analyst.\n    * It specifically asks the AI to identify **major red flags** and **hidden/unfair clauses**.\n    * It also tells the AI to format the output as a clean report using Telegram's MarkdownV2 style and to keep the response under 1500 characters.\n\n### 6. Send a text message (Telegram)\n* **What it does**: This is the final step. It takes the formatted analysis report generated by the AI Agent and sends it to your specified Telegram chat.\n* **How it works**: It connects to your Telegram bot using your Bot Token and sends the AI's output (`$json.output`) to the Chat ID you've provided. Because the AI was instructed to format the text in MarkdownV2, the message will appear well-structured in Telegram with bolding and bullet points.",
