### Workflow Process

1. **Schedule Trigger**

   * Runs every 15 minutes to ensure orders are frequently evaluated.
   * Maintains real-time responsiveness without overloading systems.

2. **Fetch Pending Orders**

   * Retrieves all orders in pending or confirmed state from ERP API.
   * Configurable limit (e.g., 100 orders per run) for controlled processing.

3. **Fetch Customer SLA Data**

   * Collects SLA tiers, delivery timeframes, and customer-specific priorities from ERP or CRM API.
   * Supports dynamic customer segmentation (Gold, Silver, Bronze tiers).

4. **Calculate Priority Scores**

   * Assigns weighted priority scores based on multiple criteria:

     * Urgency: **40%**
     * Tier: **30%**
     * Order Value: **20%**
     * Profit Margin: **10%**
   * Produces a composite score used for sorting and scheduling.

5. **Check if SLA Critical**

   * Detects if any order is close to or past SLA deadlines.
   * Routes SLA-breached orders for immediate escalation.

6. **Create Urgent Picking Task**

   * Generates warehouse picking tasks for critical orders.
   * Assigns to senior pickers or rapid response teams.

7. **Alert Warehouse Manager**

   * Sends instant SMS and email alerts for SLA-critical or high-priority orders.
   * Ensures immediate managerial attention.

8. **Batch Normal Orders**

   * Groups non-critical orders into batches of 10 for optimized processing.
   * Reduces load on WMS while maintaining steady throughput.

9. **Generate Picking Schedule**

   * Creates smart picking schedules based on urgency:

     * **High Priority:** Same-day
     * **Normal:** Within 1 day
     * **Low:** Within 2–3 days

10. **Create Bulk Picking Tasks**

    * Pushes picking tasks into WMS (Warehouse Management System).
    * Uses auto-assignment and route optimization logic.

11. **Generate Dispatch Schedule**

    * Builds dispatch timelines according to delivery method: Express, Priority, or Standard.
    * Syncs with transport capacity data.

12. **Schedule Dispatches in TMS**

    * Sends dispatch requests to TMS (Transport Management System).
    * Books carriers and reserves capacity for each batch.

13. **Update Order Statuses**

    * Updates ERP with new order statuses, schedules, and expected delivery dates.
    * Maintains a unified view across systems.

14. **Generate Summary Report**

    * Creates a summary JSON report including:

      * Total orders processed
      * SLA-critical cases
      * Dispatch breakdowns
      * Next deadlines

15. **Send Summary Notification**

    * Emails the operations team with execution summary and performance metrics.
    * Ensures team alignment and SLA visibility.
