Transform database design from weeks to minutes with this intelligent multi-agent system. Perfect for agencies, consultancies, and SaaS companies offering database architecture as a lead magnet or service.

🤖 **4 Specialized AI Agents:**
- **Agent 1 (Architect):** Designs complete schema with tables, relationships, indexes
- **Agent 2 (Reviewer):** Validates design for performance, security, scalability
- **Agent 3 (Optimizer):** Adds advanced features and scores the design (0-100)
- **Agent 4 (SQL Generator):** Creates production-ready migration scripts

🔄 **Smart Quality Loop:**
Automatically retries up to 3 times if score falls below B grade, feeding previous feedback to improve the design iteratively.

✨ **What You Get:**
- Complete database schema (JSON)
- Comprehensive score card with letter grade
- Review feedback with severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Production-ready SQL migration script
- Optional auto-execution in PostgreSQL/MySQL
- Iteration count and optimization recommendations

💼 **Perfect For:**
- Digital agencies offering database design services
- SaaS companies needing rapid prototyping
- Consultancies creating lead magnets
- Developers modernizing legacy systems
- Startups validating data models

🎯 **Use as Lead Magnet:**
Offer free database blueprints to capture leads, then upsell implementation, custom automations, and ongoing optimization services.

⚙️ **Technical Highlights:**
- Optimized temperature settings per agent (0.1-0.5)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 for maximum quality
- Structured JSON output for easy integration
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Execution time: 60-90 seconds average

## Setup Instructions

PREREQUISITES:
- Anthropic API key (Claude Sonnet 4.5 access)
- PostgreSQL/MySQL database (optional, for auto-execution)
- n8n version 1.0+ with LangChain nodes

CONFIGURATION STEPS:

1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance

2. Configure Anthropic API credentials:
   - Add your Anthropic API key in n8n credentials
   - Connect all 4 AI model nodes to your credential

3. (Optional) Configure database connection:
   - In "Execute SQL in PostgreSQL" node, add your database credentials
   - Use a TEST/SANDBOX database, never production
   - Or disable this node if you prefer manual execution

4. Customize the form (optional):
   - Edit form fields in "On form submission" node
   - Add industry-specific questions
   - Adjust required fields based on your needs

5. Test the workflow:
   - Use the form URL to submit a test request
   - Check execution time and quality
   - Verify all agents are responding correctly

6. Customize agent prompts (optional):
   - Adjust system messages for industry-specific requirements
   - Modify scoring criteria in Agent 3
   - Add custom validation rules in Agent 2

7. Deploy:
   - Share the form URL as your lead magnet
   - Embed in website or landing pages
   - Set up email notifications for submissions

COST CONSIDERATIONS:
- Each execution costs ~$0.15-0.30 in API calls
- Failed attempts (retries) increase cost
- Consider rate limiting for public forms

## Requirements

REQUIRED:
- Anthropic API Key (Claude access)
- n8n version 1.0+
- LangChain nodes enabled

OPTIONAL:
- PostgreSQL/MySQL database connection (for auto-execution)
- Email service (for result delivery)
- CRM integration (for lead capture)
