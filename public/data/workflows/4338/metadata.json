  "description": "This workflow automates the daily backup of all your n8n workflows to a designated folder in Nextcloud. It ensures that you always have the last 7 days of backups available while automatically deleting older ones to save space.\n\n\n🔧 Features\n\n    Scheduled Trigger: Runs automatically once per day (can be executed manually as well).\n\n    Directory Management: Creates the /N8N-Backup directory in Nextcloud if it doesn't already exist.\n\n    Backup Collection: Retrieves all workflows from the n8n instance.\n\n    JSON Conversion: Converts each workflow into a JSON file.\n\n    Upload to Nextcloud: Saves each backup file into the specified backup directory.\n\n    Retention Control: Keeps only the latest 7 backups and deletes the rest from Nextcloud.\n\n📌 Notes\n\n    Make sure to manually create the /N8N-Backup directory in your Nextcloud account before using this flow.\n\n    Update the Backup Path node if you wish to change the upload directory.\n\n    Ideal for teams using n8n with self-hosted instances and requiring offsite backup via Nextcloud.\n\n🔒 Requirements\n\n    n8n instance with access to the Nextcloud node.\n\n    Valid credentials for your Nextcloud account with API access.\n\n\nUpdate: 08/11/2025 “Backup Flows to Nextcloud” – Import format fixed\n\nSummary:\nThe workflow now exports one clean JSON object per workflow (no arrays, no backup/meta fields), so files can be imported 1:1 via the n8n UI.\n\nWhat changed:\n\n    Switched from “Convert to File” to a Set node that builds the JSON in binary data.\n\n    Enabled filters.include = \"all\" on Get many workflows to include nodes, connections, settings, pinData, and tags.\n\n    Sanitized filenames and removed IDs/metadata that can break UI imports.\n\n    Fixed Nextcloud path and binary property mapping (data).\n\nVerification:\n\n    Generated multiple backups and imported each via UI (“Import from file”) without errors.\n\n    Each file begins with { (single object) and loads with full workflow structure.\n\nNotes:\n\n    Keep “Binary Property” set to data in the Nextcloud node.\n\n    Filenames are sanitized to avoid special-character issues.",
