This n8n workflow enables you to export data from Zammad, including Users, Roles, Groups, and Organizations, into individual Excel files. It simplifies data handling and reporting by creating structured outputs for further processing or sharing.

## Features
- Export Users with associated details such as `email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `role_ids`, and `group_ids`.
- Export Roles and Organizations with their respective identifiers and names.
- Convert all data into separate Excel files for easy access and use.

## Usage
1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure the required Zammad API credentials (`zammad_base_url` and `zammad_api_key`) in the `Basic Variables` node.
3. Run the workflow to generate Excel files containing Zammad data.
