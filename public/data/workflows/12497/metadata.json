  "description": "![image 6.png](fileId:3892)\n## 📘 Description\n This workflow automates market-driven content ideation by continuously discovering real user pain points from public discussions and converting them into execution-ready content ideas. It is designed for growth and content teams who want ideas grounded in actual customer language, frustrations, and unmet needs—rather than assumptions or generic brainstorming.\nOn a scheduled basis, the workflow scans public search and social platforms for conversations related to a defined niche and keyword set. An AI discovery agent extracts recurring pain points, common complaints, and the exact phrasing users use when describing their problems. These raw market signals are then transformed by a second AI agent into pain-driven content ideas, each mapped to a platform, format, hook, core pain point, resonance logic, and CTA.\nAll generated ideas are normalized, stored in a central Google Sheets content database, converted into execution tasks in ClickUp, and summarized in Slack for immediate team visibility. Built-in error handling ensures failures are reported instantly.\n## ⚠️ Deployment Disclaimer\n This workflow is intended for self-hosted n8n instances only.\n It relies on MCP-based social intelligence tools and advanced AI agent orchestration not supported on n8n Cloud.\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n- ⏰ Scheduled Market Discovery Trigger\n Runs automatically on a defined schedule.\n- 🧾 Inject Niche and Keyword Parameters\n Defines the research scope for discovery.\n- 🔎 Extract Raw User Pain Points (AI)\n Scans public discussions to capture real frustrations, questions, and language—no solutions, no opinions.\n- 📡 Public Search & Social Intelligence (MCP)\n Fetches relevant public conversations for analysis.\n- 🧠 Generate Pain-Driven Content Ideas (AI)\n Converts raw pain points into platform-ready content ideas with hooks, formats, and CTAs.\n- 🧹 Normalize & Parse AI Output\n Cleans and standardizes content ideas for downstream systems.\n- 📊 Store Content Ideas in Google Sheets\n Appends ideas to a centralized content database.\n- 🗂 Create Content Tasks in ClickUp\n Automatically creates execution-ready tasks for the content team.\n- 📣 Aggregate & Summarize Ideas\n Generates a concise Slack summary highlighting volume, platforms, and strongest hooks.\n- 🚨 Workflow Error Handler → Email Alert\n Sends immediate error notifications if any step fails.\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n • Self-hosted n8n instance\n • OpenAI API credentials\n • MCP (Xpoz) public search & social intelligence credentials\n • Google Sheets API access\n • ClickUp API credentials\n • Slack API access\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Content ideas grounded in real user pain\n ✔ Eliminates manual research and brainstorming\n ✔ Produces creator-ready, platform-specific ideas\n ✔ Centralized storage and task creation\n ✔ Clear Slack visibility for growth teams\n ✔ Reliable error monitoring\n## 👥 Perfect For\n Content strategists\n Growth marketers\n B2B SaaS teams\n Automation and n8n-focused creators\n Marketing operations teams",
