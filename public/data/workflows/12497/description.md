## 📘 Description
 This workflow automates market-driven content ideation by continuously discovering real user pain points from public discussions and converting them into execution-ready content ideas. It is designed for growth and content teams who want ideas grounded in actual customer language, frustrations, and unmet needs—rather than assumptions or generic brainstorming.
On a scheduled basis, the workflow scans public search and social platforms for conversations related to a defined niche and keyword set. An AI discovery agent extracts recurring pain points, common complaints, and the exact phrasing users use when describing their problems. These raw market signals are then transformed by a second AI agent into pain-driven content ideas, each mapped to a platform, format, hook, core pain point, resonance logic, and CTA.
All generated ideas are normalized, stored in a central Google Sheets content database, converted into execution tasks in ClickUp, and summarized in Slack for immediate team visibility. Built-in error handling ensures failures are reported instantly.
## ⚠️ Deployment Disclaimer
 This workflow is intended for self-hosted n8n instances only.
 It relies on MCP-based social intelligence tools and advanced AI agent orchestration not supported on n8n Cloud.
