# Create UGC Style Product Ad Video via Telegram + Gemini + Kie.ai’s Veo3.1 API

## Who’s it for
- For creators, marketers, and e-commerce sellers who want to instantly generate short UGC-style product videos from a simple Telegram message — no manual editing or video skills required.

## How it works / What it does
- This workflow automatically turns a Telegram photo and caption into a 30-second UGC-style video ad using AI.

1. A user sends a photo + caption on Telegram. 
2. Gemini AI reads the caption and image to generate a realistic UGC script with tone, benefits, and call-to-action. 
3. The photo and script are sent to Kie.ai’s Veo3.1 API, which creates a high-quality vertical video (9:16) using the image and narration.
4. Once rendered, the finished video ad is automatically sent back to the Telegram chat. 

## How to set up
- Connect your Telegram Bot credentials.
- Add your Google Gemini API key in the Gemini node.
- Create a Kie.ai account and obtain your Veo3.1 API key.
- Paste the key in the HTTP Request nodes where required.
- Activate the workflow — send a Telegram message with a product photo + caption to test.

## Requirements
- Telegram Bot API key
- Google Gemini API key
- Kie.ai Veo3.1 API key

## How to customize the workflow
- Change Gemini prompt style (e.g., humorous, professional, emotional).
- Adjust Kie.ai model parameters (aspect ratio, duration, voice, or style).
- Add branding overlays or logos after video generation.
- Integrate with Google Drive, Notion, or Airtable to save results automatically.
- Modify the Telegram response to include both the video and the AI-generated script
