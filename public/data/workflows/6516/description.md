### 📊 TikTok Account Monitoring Automation 

This n8n workflow automates the daily process of fetching TikTok account analytics using the [**TikTok API**](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/tiktok-api42) and logging the results to **Google Sheets**.

It helps marketing teams, social media managers, and influencer agencies track video performance and audience growth across multiple TikTok usernames without manual effort.

## 🔁 Workflow Summary

1. **⏰ Trigger via Schedule**
   - The workflow runs automatically every day (or any custom interval), ensuring data is consistently updated without manual input.

2. **📥 Sheet 1 – Read TikTok Usernames**
   - A Google Sheet stores the list of TikTok usernames you want to monitor.
   - ✅ Example Columns:
     - `username`
     - `category`
     - `priority`
     - `notes`

3. **🔁 Loop Through Each Username**
   - Each username is processed individually in a loop to make separate API calls and avoid data conflicts.

4. **📡 Fetch Analytics via RapidAPI**  
   - The following [**TikTok API**](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/tiktok-api42) endpoint is used:  
     [**`POST https://tiktok-api42.p.rapidapi.com/videos_view_count.php`**](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/tiktok-api42)
   - You get per-user stats like:
     - Number of videos
     - Total views
     - Recent video views
   - This endpoint is highly stable and works without TikTok login or auth.

   - Fetched data is logged in another Google Sheet for performance tracking.
   - ✅ Example Columns:
     - `username`
     - `total_videos`
     - `total_views`
     - `average_views`
     - `fetch_date`
     - `category`

6. **📦 Sheet 3 – Log API History or Errors**

   - ✅ Example Columns:
     - `username`
     - `status` (e.g., success, failed, skipped)
     - `message`
     - `timestamp`
