## Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **Sales** and **Customer Success** professionals seeking alerts when potential high-value users, prospects, or existing customers register for a Discourse community. Leveraging Clearbit, it retrieves enriched data for the new member to assess their value.
### Example result in Slack

## How it works
- Each time a new member is created in Discourse, the workflow runs (powered by Discourse's native Webhooks feature).
- After filtering out popular private email accounts, we run the member's email through Clearbit to fetch available information on the member as well as their organization. 
- If the enriched data meets certain criteria, we send a Slack message to a channel. This message has a few quick actions: `Open LinkedIn profile` and `Email member`
