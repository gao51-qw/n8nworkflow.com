  "description": "# Handle WhatsApp customer inquiries with AI and intent routing (Whatsapp Chatbot)\n\nAn intelligent, **fully customizable** WhatsApp customer support chatbot template that works for ANY business - whether you sell fashion, electronics, food, furniture, cosmetics, or anything else. This workflow combines pre-built responses for common queries with AI for complex questions, creating a cost-effective 24/7 customer support solution that adapts to your specific products and services.\n\n## Who it's for\n\nThis **universal template** works for ANY business type:\n- **E-commerce stores** (fashion, electronics, home goods, beauty, etc.)\n- **Local retail shops** (boutiques, grocery stores, bookshops, etc.)\n- **Service businesses** (salons, repair services, consultancies, etc.)\n- **Restaurants & cafes** (food delivery, reservations, menu inquiries)\n- **Any business** using WhatsApp Business API for customer communication\n\n## What it does\n\n**This is a UNIVERSAL template** - it works for ANY business by simply updating the product categories, company information, and response templates. No coding knowledge required for basic customization!\n\nThe workflow automates WhatsApp customer support through intelligent routing and AI assistance:\n\n1. **Receives WhatsApp messages** via WhatsApp Business API webhook trigger\n2. **Parses message data** extracting user info, chat ID, and message text\n3. **Classifies intent** using pattern matching to determine what the customer wants (product inquiry, contact info, support, greeting, etc.)\n4. **Routes intelligently** to the most appropriate response handler:\n   - **Product inquiries** → Pre-built catalog responses with pricing and links\n   - **Contact information** → Static company details (address, phone, hours)\n   - **Complex queries** → AI agent with full company context\n5. **Maintains conversation context** using memory to remember previous messages\n6. **Sends formatted responses** back to the customer via WhatsApp with markdown formatting\n\nThe hybrid approach (pre-built responses + AI) balances speed, cost, and intelligence - common questions get instant answers while complex queries receive personalized AI assistance.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou'll need:\n- **WhatsApp Business API** access (via Twilio, 360Dialog, Meta Cloud API, or other providers)\n- **Google Gemini API key** (for AI responses) -

Replace them with YOUR categories:\n\n**For a Fashion Store:**\n```javascript\nconst categories = [\n  { pattern: /(shirt|tshirt|top)/i, category: 'tops' },\n  { pattern: /(jeans|pants|trousers)/i, category: 'bottoms' },\n  { pattern: /(dress|gown|kurti)/i, category: 'dresses' },\n  { pattern: /(shoe|footwear|heels)/i, category: 'shoes' },\n];\n```\n\n**For a Grocery Store:**\n```javascript\nconst categories = [\n  { pattern: /(vegetable|veggies)/i, category: 'vegetables' },\n  { pattern: /(fruit|fruits)/i, category: 'fruits' },\n  { pattern: /(dairy|milk|cheese)/i, category: 'dairy' },\n  { pattern: /(snack|chips|biscuit)/i, category: 'snacks' },\n];\n```\n\n**For a Beauty/Cosmetics Store:**\n```javascript\nconst categories = [\n  { pattern: /(skincare|cream|serum)/i, category: 'skincare' },\n  { pattern: /(makeup|lipstick|foundation)/i, category: 'makeup' },\n  { pattern: /(perfume|fragrance)/i, category: 'perfumes' },\n  { pattern: /(hair|shampoo|conditioner)/i, category: 'haircare' },\n];\n```\n\n**For a Home Furniture Store:**\n```javascript\nconst categories = [\n  { pattern: /(sofa|couch)/i, category: 'sofas' },\n  { pattern: /(bed|mattress)/i, category: 'bedroom' },\n  { pattern: /(table|desk|dining)/i, category: 'tables' },\n  { pattern: /(chair|seating)/i, category: 'chairs' },\n];\n```\n\n**For a Restaurant:**\n```javascript\nconst categories = [\n  { pattern: /(pizza|italian)/i, category: 'italian' },\n  { pattern: /(burger|sandwich)/i, category: 'fast_food' },\n  { pattern: /(biryani|curry|indian)/i, category: 'indian' },\n  { pattern: /(dessert|sweet|ice cream)/i, category: 'desserts' },\n];\n```\n\n---\n\n### STEP 2: Customize Product Responses\n\nUpdate the \"Generate Product Response\" node with YOUR actual products:\n\n**Example for Fashion Store:**\n```javascript\nif (category === 'tops') {\n  response = `Hi ${userName}!
