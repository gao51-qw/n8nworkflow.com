# Handle WhatsApp customer inquiries with AI and intent routing (Whatsapp Chatbot)

An intelligent, **fully customizable** WhatsApp customer support chatbot template that works for ANY business - whether you sell fashion, electronics, food, furniture, cosmetics, or anything else. This workflow combines pre-built responses for common queries with AI for complex questions, creating a cost-effective 24/7 customer support solution that adapts to your specific products and services.

## Who it's for

This **universal template** works for ANY business type:
- **E-commerce stores** (fashion, electronics, home goods, beauty, etc.)
- **Local retail shops** (boutiques, grocery stores, bookshops, etc.)
- **Service businesses** (salons, repair services, consultancies, etc.)
- **Restaurants & cafes** (food delivery, reservations, menu inquiries)
- **Any business** using WhatsApp Business API for customer communication

## What it does

**This is a UNIVERSAL template** - it works for ANY business by simply updating the product categories, company information, and response templates. No coding knowledge required for basic customization!

The workflow automates WhatsApp customer support through intelligent routing and AI assistance:

1. **Receives WhatsApp messages** via WhatsApp Business API webhook trigger
2. **Parses message data** extracting user info, chat ID, and message text
3. **Classifies intent** using pattern matching to determine what the customer wants (product inquiry, contact info, support, greeting, etc.)
4. **Routes intelligently** to the most appropriate response handler:
   - **Product inquiries** → Pre-built catalog responses with pricing and links
   - **Contact information** → Static company details (address, phone, hours)
   - **Complex queries** → AI agent with full company context
5. **Maintains conversation context** using memory to remember previous messages
6. **Sends formatted responses** back to the customer via WhatsApp with markdown formatting

The hybrid approach (pre-built responses + AI) balances speed, cost, and intelligence - common questions get instant answers while complex queries receive personalized AI assistance.

## How it works

### Intent Classification System

The workflow uses keyword pattern matching to classify user intent into these categories:

**Priority 1: Contact Information** (highest priority)
- Triggers: "where is store", "address", "contact", "phone number"
- Response: Static contact details
- Why first: Users asking for contact info need immediate, accurate answers

**Priority 2: Greetings**
- Triggers: "hi", "hello", "hey", "good morning"
- Response: Friendly welcome with menu options
- Helps: Sets a positive tone for the conversation

**Priority 3: Product Inquiries**
- Triggers: Category keywords (monitor, processor, GPU, RAM, etc.)
- Response: Pre-built catalog with products, prices, and links
- Categories: Customizable based on your products

**Priority 4: AI Fallback**
- Triggers: Everything else (comparisons, complex questions, multi-step queries)
- Response: Google Gemini AI with company knowledge
- Features: Conversation memory, personalized recommendations

### Response Architecture

**Pre-Built Responses (Fast & Cost-Effective)**
- Instant answers (no API calls)
- Handles 70-80% of queries
- Consistent, accurate information
- No ongoing costs
- Used for: Product lists, contact info, FAQs

**AI Agent (Intelligent & Flexible)**
- Handles complex questions
- Maintains conversation context
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Adapts to different query styles
- Used for: Comparisons, custom builds, technical questions

### Conversation Memory

The workflow uses buffer window memory to remember recent conversation:
- Stores last 10 messages per user
- Enables multi-turn conversations
- AI can reference previous questions
- Creates more natural interactions
- Memory is user-specific (isolated by user ID)

### Message Flow Example

**User**: "Hi"
→ Intent: greeting
→ Response: Welcome message with menu

**User**: "Show me monitors"
→ Intent: product_inquiry (monitors)
→ Response: Pre-built list of monitors with prices

**User**: "Which one is best for gaming?"
→ Intent: general_inquiry (complex)
→ Response: AI analyzes previous context (monitors) and recommends gaming-focused option

**User**: "What's your address?"
→ Intent: contact_info
→ Response: Complete contact details

## How to customize the workflow

### STEP 1: Customize Product Categories

The workflow comes with example categories for multiple business types. Replace them with YOUR categories:

**For a Fashion Store:**
```javascript
const categories = [
  { pattern: /(shirt|tshirt|top)/i, category: 'tops' },
  { pattern: /(jeans|pants|trousers)/i, category: 'bottoms' },

];
```

  { pattern: /(snack|chips|biscuit)/i, category: 'snacks' },
];
```

**For a Beauty/Cosmetics Store:**

```

```

### STEP 2: Customize Product Responses

Update the "Generate Product Response" node with YOUR actual products:

**Example for Fashion Store:**

}
```

  response = `Fresh *VEGETABLES* available, ${userName}:\\n\\n`;
  response += `🥕 *Fresh Carrots (1kg)*\\n   💰 ₹40\\n   🌱 Organic\\n\\n`;
  response += `🍅 *Tomatoes (1kg)*\\n   💰 ₹30\\n   ✅ Farm Fresh\\n\\n`;
}
```

- WhatsApp Business API typically requires business verification
- Message rates and limits vary by provider

- Always provide a way to reach human support

**Getting Started Tip**: Start with just contact info and product inquiries. Once that works smoothly, add AI responses for complex queries. Gradually expand based on actual customer needs you observe in conversations.
