## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?

Manually entering bank statements into QuickBooks is one of the most time-consuming and error-prone accounting tasks. Accountants often spend hours converting PDF bank statements into individual income and expense entries—risking missed transactions, incorrect categorization, and inconsistencies.

This workflow **fully automates the end-to-end process**: from uploading a (even password-protected) bank statement PDF to creating **accurate Sales Receipts and Expenses directly inside QuickBooks**, using AI and n8n.

## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

- Accepts bank statement PDFs via a secure web form  
- Decrypts and extracts text from password-protected PDFs  
- Uses AI to extract **structured transactions** from raw statement text  
- Validates AI output against a strict JSON schema  
- Processes each transaction individually for reliability  
- Automatically routes transactions based on type:
  - **Credits → Income (Sales Receipts)**
  - **Debits → Expenses**
- Intelligently creates missing QuickBooks entities:
  - Customers
  - Vendors
  - Items
  - Expense categories
- Posts transactions directly into QuickBooks  
- Eliminates manual accounting entry completely

## 🧠 How It Works – End-to-End Flow

### 1️⃣ Secure Bank Statement Upload
A user uploads a bank statement PDF (normal or password-protected) using an **n8n Form Trigger**.

### 2️⃣ PDF Decryption & Text Extraction
The workflow:
- Unlocks the PDF (if password-protected)
- Extracts the full statement text using the **Extract PDF Text** node

### 3️⃣ AI-Powered Transaction Extraction
An **AI Agent** reads the raw bank statement text and extracts every transaction with high precision:
- Transaction type (credit / debit)
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)`
- Amount
- Description
- Reference number
- Payee / counterparty

### 4️⃣ Strict JSON Validation
AI output is validated using a **Structured Output Parser** to ensure:
- No malformed data
- Schema-safe transactions
- Reliable downstream processing

### 5️⃣ Transaction Processing Loop
Each transaction is processed individually using batching and loop control to guarantee accuracy.

### 6️⃣ Smart Routing: Credit vs Debit
A switch node routes transactions automatically:
- **Credits** → Income flow
- **Debits** → Expense flow

For every **credit transaction**:
- Checks if a matching QuickBooks item exists
- Creates missing service items automatically
- Finds or creates the customer

## 💸 Debit Path – Expense Automation

For every **debit transaction**:
- Searches for the vendor by payee name
- Creates the vendor if missing
- Loads expense categories from the Chart of Accounts
- Auto-maps transactions to the correct category using keyword logic
- Builds a **Purchase (Expense) payload**
- Posts the expense into QuickBooks
