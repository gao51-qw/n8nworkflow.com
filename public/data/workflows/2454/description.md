### **How it works:**

1. **Fetch & Filter Emails:** The workflow retrieves emails from your Microsoft Outlook account, filtering out flagged emails and those already categorised.
2. **Content Preparation:** Each email is cleaned up and converted to a structured format using Markdown, making it easier for AI processing.
3. **AI Categorization:** The content is analysed using an AI model, which categorises the emails into predefined categories (e.g., Action, Junk, Business, SaaS) based on the context and content.
4. **Email Categorization & Folder Management:** The categorised emails are updated in Microsoft Outlook and moved to respective folders such as "Junk Email" or "Receipts" based on the AI's classification.
5. **Conditional Processing & Final Checks:** Additional checks and conditions ensure that only unread emails are processed, and errors are gracefully managed to maintain workflow stability.

### **Set up steps:**

1. **Connect Microsoft Outlook:** Link your Microsoft Outlook account using the built-in credentials node to enable email fetching, updating, and folder management.
2. **Configure AI Model (Ollama API):** Set up the AI model by connecting to the Ollama API and choosing your desired language model for categorisation.
3. **Modify Email Categories (Optional):** Customize the categories and subcategories within the workflow to suit your unique email management needs.
4. **Set Up Error Handling:** Review the error handling node settings to ensure smooth workflow execution.
