## 🧑‍💻 Description
This workflow automatically **fetches new Gmail messages since the last run** and appends them into a **Google Sheet** with their ID, snippet, and timestamp.  

It’s designed for **professionals, small business owners, and operations teams** who need a simple way to keep an ongoing log of emails, build lightweight CRMs, or power downstream automations like **email tracking, reporting, or follow-up reminders**.

## 🧠 How Email Logging Automation Works
- **Get Current Emails** → Reads the last logged messages from Google Sheets  
- **Get Max Date** → Finds the most recent email timestamp  
- **Combine** → Passes the last timestamp and today’s date together  
- **Get New Messages** → Fetches all new Gmail messages after the last logged date  
- **Add Emails to Sheets** → Appends message ID, snippet, and date to the sheet

## 🎛️ Customization Guidance
- **Filter by Sender or Subject** → Modify the Gmail query to only log messages from specific addresses or with certain keywords.  
- **Track Labels** → Add Gmail labels to your sheet to separate categories (e.g., “Leads,” “Support,” “Invoices”).  
- **Auto-Reply** → Extend with an additional Gmail node to send automated responses to new messages.  
- **Send Alerts** → Add a Slack or Email node to ping your team whenever a new email is logged.  
- **Analytics** → Use Google Sheets formulas or connect to BI tools to analyze trends like response times or sender frequency.
