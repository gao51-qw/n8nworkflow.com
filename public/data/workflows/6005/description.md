## Overview
This workflow automates the process of sending personalized cold email sequences to your prospects. It fetches un-emailed leads from your Google Sheet, validates their email addresses, and then dispatches tailored emails according to a predefined schedule. It updates your CRM (Google Sheet) with the status of each sent email, ensuring your outreach efforts are tracked and efficient.

## Use Case
This workflow is perfect for:
* **Sales Teams**: Automate the delivery of multi-stage cold email campaigns to a large volume of leads.
* **Business Development**: Nurture prospects over time with a structured email sequence.
* **Recruiters**: Send out introductory emails to potential candidates for open positions.
* **Marketers**: Distribute personalized outreach for events, content, or product launches.
* **Anyone doing cold outreach**: Ensure consistent follow-up and track email performance without manual effort.

## How It Works

1.  **Scheduled Trigger**: The workflow is set to run automatically at a defined interval (e.g., every 6 hours, as currently configured by the "Set Timer" node). This ensures regular outreach without manual intervention.
2.  **Fetch Unsent Emails**: The "Get Emails" node queries your Google Sheet to identify prospects who haven't yet received the current email in the sequence (i.e., "Email Sent " is "No").
3.  **Control Volume**: A "Limit" node can be used to control the number of emails sent in each batch, preventing you from sending too many emails at once and potentially hitting sending limits.
4.  **Loop Through Prospects**: The "Loop Over Items" node processes each selected prospect individually.
5.  **Email Validation (Conditional Send)**: An "If" node checks if the prospect's "Email Address" is valid and exists. This prevents sending emails to invalid addresses, improving deliverability.
6.  **Send Email**:
    * **"Send Email" Node**: For valid email addresses, this node dispatches the personalized email to the prospect. It retrieves the recipient's email, subject, and body from your Google Sheet.
    * **"connect" Node**: (Note: The provided JSON uses a generic `emailSend` node named "connect" that links to an SMTP credential. This represents the actual email sending mechanism, whether it's Gmail or a custom SMTP server.)
7.  **Update CRM**: After successfully sending an email, the "Update Records" node updates your Google Sheet. It marks the "Email Sent " column as "Yes" and records the "Sent on" timestamp and a "Message Id" for tracking.
8.  **Delay Between Sends**: A "Wait" node introduces a delay between sending emails to individual prospects. This helps mimic human sending behavior and can improve deliverability.

## How to Set It Up

To set up your Automated Cold Email Sender, follow these steps:

1.  **Google Sheet Setup**:
    * **Duplicate the Provided Template**: Make a copy of the Google Sheet Template (`1TjXelyGPg5G8lbPDI9_XOReTzmU1o52z2R3v8dYaoQM`) into your own Google Drive. This sheet should contain columns for "Name", "Email Address ", "Sender Email", "Email Subject", "Email Body", "Email Sent ", "Sent on", and "Message Id".
    * **Connect Google Sheets**: Ensure your Google Sheets OAuth2 API credentials are set up in n8n and linked to the "Get Emails" and "Update Records" nodes.
    * **Update Sheet IDs**: In both "Get Emails" and "Update Records" nodes, update the `documentId` with the ID of *your copied template*.
2.  **Email Sending Service Credentials**:
    * **Gmail**: If using Gmail, ensure your Gmail OAuth2 credentials are configured and connected to the "Send Email" node (or the "connect" node, if that's your chosen sender).
    * **Other Email Services (SMTP)**: If you use a different email service, you'll need to set up an SMTP credential in n8n and connect it to the "connect" node. Refer to the "Sticky Note4" for guidance on non-Google email services.
3.  **Configure Timer**:
    * In the "Set Timer" node, adjust the `hoursInterval` or other time settings to define how frequently you want the email sending process to run (e.g., every 6 hours, once a day, etc.).
4.  **Control Volume (Optional)**:
    * In the "Limit" node, you can set the `maxItems` to control how many emails are processed and sent in each batch. This is useful for managing email sending limits or gradual outreach.
5.  **Import the Workflow**: Import the provided workflow JSON into your n8n instance.
6.  **Populate Your Sheet**: Fill your copied Google Sheet with prospect data, including the email subject and body for each email you wish to send. Ensure the "Email Sent " column is initially "No".
7.  **Activate and Monitor**: Activate the workflow. It will begin fetching and sending emails based on your configured schedule. Monitor your Google Sheet to track the "Email Sent " status.

This workflow provides a robust and automated solution for managing your cold email campaigns, saving you time and increasing your outreach efficiency.
