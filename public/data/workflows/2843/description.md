# **Automate Sports Betting Data with TheOddsAPI**  

This workflow enables you to create and update a table using TheOddsAPI for sports betting data. It automatically pulls upcoming Ice Hockey games at the start of the day and updates the table with results at the end of the day. You can modify it to retrieve odds and game data for any sport.  

This setup is particularly useful for sports betting applications, such as tracking the results of a predictive model. It leverages scheduled triggers to activate HTTP requests, which then create or update fields in Airtable by matching on the game ID.
