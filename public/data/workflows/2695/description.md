## Setup

1. Replace the trigger with your desired trigger eg a webhook or manual trigger

2. Map the data correctly to the `set Keywords` node
3. On the `Generate new keywords`, Update the `{customer_id} on the url and login-customer-id with your actual one. Update the `developer-token` also with your values. 

The url should be corrected as below https://googleads.googleapis.com/v18/customers/{customer-id}:generateKeywordIdeas

You should send the headers as below

```


            {
              "name": "content-type",
              "value": "application/json"
            },
            {
              "name": "developer-token",
              "value": "5j-tyzivCNmiCcoW-xkaxw"
            },
            {
              "name": "login-customer-id",
              "value": "513554 "
            }
         
    


```

and the json body should take the following format 

```

{
  "geoTargetConstants": ["geoTargetConstants/2840"], 
  "includeAdultKeywords": false,
  "pageToken": "",
  "pageSize": 2,
  "keywordPlanNetwork": "GOOGLE_SEARCH",
  "language": "languageConstants/1000", 
  "keywordSeed": {
    "keywords": {{ $json.Keyword }}
  }
}

```



## Troubleshooting

1. If you get an error with the workflow, check the credentials you are using

2. Check the account you are using eg the right customer id and developer token

3. Follow the [guide ](https://funautomations.io/workflows/automating-keyword-generation-with-n8n-google-ads-api/)on the blog to set up your Google ads account
