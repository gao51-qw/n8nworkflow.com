This workflow template helps Todoist users get a weekly overview of their completed tasks via email, making it easier to review their past week.

### Why use this workflow?
Todoist doesn’t provide completed task reports or filters in its built-in reports or n8n app. This workflow solves that by using Todoist’s public API to fetch your completed tasks.

### How it works
* Runs every Friday afternoon (or manually).
* Uses the Todoist public API to retrieve completed tasks.
* Excludes specific projects you set (e.g., a grocery list).
* Sends an email summary, grouping tasks by the day they were completed.

### Set up steps
1. Copy your Todoist API token ([found here](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer)).
2. Create a **Todoist API** credential in n8n.
3. Create an **SMTP** credential in n8n.
   - Alternatively, use a preferred email service like Brevo, Mailjet, etc.
4. Import this workflow template.
5. In the **Get completed tasks via Todoist API** step, select your Todoist API credential.
6. In the **Send Email** step:
   - Select your SMTP credential.
   - Set the sender and recipient email addresses.
7. Run the workflow manually and check your inbox!

### Ignoring specific projects
If you do not want your grocery list, workouts, or other tasks from specific Todoist projects showing up in your weekly summary, modify the step called **Optional: Ignore specific projects** and change this line:

```
const ignoredProjects = ['2335544024'];
```

This should be an array with the `id` of each project you'd like to ignore. You can find a list of your projects (inc. their Ids) by visiting this link: [https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects](https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects)
