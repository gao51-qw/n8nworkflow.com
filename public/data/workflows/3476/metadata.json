Without proper qualification, your team might spend hours pursuing prospects who aren't the right fit for your product, while ideal customers slip through the cracks.\n\n### How to Automate Identifying Your Ideal Customers\n\nWith this automation, you'll learn how to automatically score and prioritize leads using data extracted directly from LinkedIn profiles via Airtop's built-in integration with n8n. By the end, you'll have a fully automated workflow that analyzes prospects and calculates an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) score, helping your sales team focus on high-potential opportunities.\n\n### What You'll Need\n\n- A free [Airtop API key](https://portal.airtop.ai/?utm_campaign=n8n)\n- A copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O69nQkKr4fyWl5AQUrX7y-nwPCMDeFwp-2swG0YW6Cg/copy) Google Sheets\n\n### Understanding the Process\n\nThis automation transforms how you qualify and prioritize leads by extracting real-time, accurate information directly from LinkedIn profiles.

Within hours, they can identify the top 50 prospects based on ICP score.\n\n**SaaS Analytics Tool**: A SaaS company could implement LinkedIn enrichment to identify which companies fit best. The automation processes weekly leads and categorizes them into high, medium, and low priority tiers, allowing their sales team to focus on the most promising opportunities first.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo get the most out of this automation:\n\n- Review and refine your ICP criteria quarterly: What constitutes an ideal customer may evolve as your product and market develop\n- Create tiered follow-up processes: Develop different outreach strategies based on ICP score ranges\n- Perform regular data validation: Periodically check the accuracy of the automated scoring against your actual sales results\n\n### What's Next?\n\nNow that you've automated your ICP scoring with LinkedIn data, you might be interested in:\n\n- Setting up automated outreach sequences based on ICP score thresholds\n- Creating custom reporting dashboards to track conversion rates by ICP segment\n- Expanding your scoring model to include additional data sources\n- Implementing lead assignment automation based on ICP scores\n\n\nHappy automating!",
