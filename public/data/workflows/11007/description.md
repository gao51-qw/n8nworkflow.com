   ```
   https://your-n8n.com/webhook-test/form/target
   ```

2. Fill in form:
   - **network**: Enter target (IP, range, domain)

3. Click **Submit**

4. Receive confirmation

5. Wait for report delivery

**Advantages:**
- No command line needed
- User-friendly interface
- Input validation
- Good for non-technical users

#### Method 3: Manual Execution

For testing or one-off scans:

1. Open workflow in n8n
2. Edit "Pre-Set-Target" node:
   - Change `network` value to your target
3. Click **Manual Trigger** node
4. Click **Execute Workflow**
5. Monitor progress in real-time

**Advantages:**
- See execution in real-time
- Debug issues immediately
- Test configuration changes
- View intermediate outputs

#### Method 4: Scheduled Scans

For regular, automated security audits:

1. Configure "Schedule Trigger" node with desired time
2. Configure "Pre-Set-Target" node with default target
3. Activate workflow
4. Scans run automatically on schedule

**Advantages:**
- Automated security monitoring
- Regular compliance scans
- No manual intervention needed
- Consistent scheduling

### Scan Targets Explained

#### Supported Target Formats

**Single IP Address:**
```
192.168.1.100

- Use your own isolated lab network
- Never scan public internet without permission

**Internal Networks:**
- Use CIDR notation for entire subnets
- Scan DMZ networks separately from internal
- Consider network segmentation in scan design

### Understanding Report Contents

#### Report Structure

The generated report includes:

**1. Executive Summary:**
- Total hosts discovered
- Total services identified
- Total vulnerabilities found
- Severity breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Scan date and time
- Target network

**2. Overall Statistics:**
- Visual dashboard with key metrics
- Severity distribution chart
- Quick risk assessment

**3. Detailed Findings by Host:**
For each discovered host:
- IP address
- Hostname (if resolved)
- List of open ports and services
- Service details:
  - Port number and protocol
  - Service name (e.g., http, ssh, mysql)
  - Product (e.g., Apache, OpenSSH, MySQL)
  - Version (e.g., 2.4.41, 8.2p1, 5.7.33)
  - CPE identifier

**4. Vulnerability Details:**
For each vulnerable service:
- **CVE ID**: Unique vulnerability identifier (e.g., CVE-2021-44228)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO
- **CVSS Score**: Numerical score (0.0-10.0)
- **Published Date**: When vulnerability was disclosed
- **Description**: Detailed vulnerability explanation
- **References**: Links to advisories, patches, exploits

**5. Recommendations:**
- Immediate actions (patch critical/high severity)
- Long-term improvements (security processes)
- Best practices

#### Vulnerability Severity Levels

**CRITICAL (CVSS 9.0-10.0):**
- Color: Red
- Characteristics: Remote code execution, full system compromise
- Action: Immediate patching required
- Examples: Log4Shell, EternalBlue, Heartbleed

**HIGH (CVSS 7.0-8.9):**
- Color: Orange
- Characteristics: Significant security impact, data exposure
- Action: Patch within days
- Examples: SQL injection, privilege escalation, authentication bypass

**MEDIUM (CVSS 4.0-6.9):**
- Color: Yellow
- Characteristics: Moderate security impact
- Action: Patch within weeks
- Examples: Information disclosure, denial of service, XSS

**LOW (CVSS 0.1-3.9):**
- Color: Green

- Action: No action required, awareness only
- Examples: Service version detected, no known CVEs

#### Understanding CPE

**CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):**
- Standard naming scheme for IT products
- Used for CVE lookup in NVD database

**Workflow CPE Handling:**
- Nmap detects service and version
- Nmap provides CPE (if in database)
- Workflow uses CPE to query NVD API
- NVD returns CVEs associated with that CPE
- Special case: nginx vendor fixed from `igor_sysoev` to `nginx`

   - `scanme.nmap.org`: Official Nmap test server
   - Your own isolated lab network
   - Cloud instances you own
   - Explicitly authorized environments

### Compliance Considerations

**PCI DSS:**
- Quarterly internal vulnerability scans required
- Scan all system components
