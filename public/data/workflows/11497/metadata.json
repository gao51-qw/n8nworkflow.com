  "description": "This workflow automatically processes [Fireflies.ai](https://app.fireflies.ai/login?referralCode=01K0V2Z1QHY76ZGY9450251C99) **meeting recap emails**, extracts the meeting transcript, generates a structured summary email, and sends it to a designated recipient.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Key Advantages**\n\n* #### **1.  ✅ Full Automation of Meeting Summaries**\n\n\tThe workflow eliminates all manual steps from receiving the Fireflies email to sending a polished summary. This ensures:\n\n\t* No delays\n\t* No forgotten recaps\n\t* No repetitive manual tasks\n\n* #### **2. ✅ Accurate Extraction of Meeting Information**\n\n\tUsing AI-based information extraction and custom parsing, the workflow reliably identifies:\n\n\t* The correct meeting link\n\t* The Fireflies meeting ID\n\t* Relevant transcript data\n\n\tThis avoids human error and ensures consistency.\n\n* #### **3. ✅ High-Quality, AI-Generated Email Summaries**\n\n\tThe Gemini-powered summary generator:\n\n\t* Produces well-structured, readable emails\n\t* Includes decisions, action items, and discussion points\n\t* Automatically crafts a professional subject line\n\t* Uses real content (no placeholders)\n\nThis results in clear, usable communication for recipients.\n\n* #### **4. ✅ Robust Error-Free Data Handling**\n\n\tThe workflow integrates custom JavaScript steps to:\n\n\t* Parse URLs safely\n\t* Convert AI responses into valid JSON\n\t* Ensure correct formatting before email delivery\n\nThis guarantees the message is always properly structured.\n\n* #### **5. ✅ Professional Formatting**\n\n\tBy converting Markdown to HTML, the summary:\n\n\t* Is visually clear\n\t* Displays well on all email clients\n\t* Enhances readability for recipients\n\n* #### **6. ✅ Easily Scalable and Adaptable**\n\n\tThe workflow can be expanded to:\n\t* Send summaries to multiple recipients\n\t* Add storage (e.g., Google Drive)\n\t* Trigger based on additional conditions\n\t* Integrate with CRMs or project management tools\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1. **Trigger**  \n   The workflow starts with a Gmail Trigger that checks for new emails with the subject `\"Your meeting recap\"` from `fred@fireflies.ai` every hour.\n\n2. **Email Processing**  \n   When a matching email is found, the workflow retrieves the full email content and extracts the meeting recap URL using an **Information Extractor** node powered by OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini.\n\n3. **Meeting ID Extraction**  \n   A **Code Node** extracts the meeting ID from the Fireflies URL (between `::` and `?`) for use in the next step.\n\n4. **Transcript Fetching**  \n   The meeting ID is sent to the **Fireflies Node**, which retrieves the full transcript and summary data (short summary, short overview, and full overview).\n\n5. **AI-Powered Email Generation**  \n   The meeting summary data is passed to a **Google Gemini** node, which generates a complete meeting summary email with a subject line and body in JSON format.\n\n6. **Data Formatting**  \n   The raw JSON output is parsed in a **Code Node**, and the email body is converted from Markdown to HTML using the **Markdown Node**.\n\n7. **Email Delivery**  \n   Finally, the email is sent via Gmail with the AI-generated subject and HTML body.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\n1. **Configure Credentials**  \n   - Set up Gmail OAuth2 credentials for email triggering and sending.  \n   - Add Fireflies.ai API credentials for fetching transcripts.  \n   - Configure OpenAI and Google Gemini API keys for AI processing.\n\n2. **Adjust Email Filters**  \n   Update the Gmail Trigger filters (`subject` and `sender`) if Fireflies.ai uses a different sender or subject format.\n\n3. **Customize Output Email**  \n   Modify the recipient email in the **Send email** node to the desired address.\n\n4. **Optional: Modify AI Prompts**  \n   Adjust the system prompts in the **Information Extractor** and **Email Agent** nodes to change extraction behavior or email tone.\n\n5. **Activate Workflow**  \n   Ensure the workflow is set to **Active** in n8n, and test it by sending a sample Fireflies recap email to your connected Gmail account.\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
