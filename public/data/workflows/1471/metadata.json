  "description": "I wanted a system to monitor website content changes and notify me. So I made it using n8n.\n\nEspecially my competitor blogs. I wanted to know how often they are posting new articles. (I used their sitemap.xml file) (The below workflow may vary)\n\nIn the Below example, I used HackerNews for example.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- First HTTP Request node crawls the webpage and grabs the website source code\n- Then wait for x minutes\n- Again, HTTP Node crawls the webpage\n- If Node compares both results are equal if anything is changed. It’ll go to the false branch and notify me in telegram.\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n![](https://community.n8n.io/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b737a95de4dfe0825d50ca098171e9f33a459e74_2_690x288.png)\n\n**Sample Response:**\n\n![](https://community.n8n.io/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d21ba41d7ac9ff5cd8148fedb07d0f1ff53b2529.png)\n",
