  "title": "Create a speech-to-text API with OpenAI GPT4o-mini transcribe",
  "description": "## Description\n\nThis template provides a simple and powerful backend for adding speech-to-text capabilities to any application. It creates a dedicated webhook that receives an audio file, transcribes it using OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model, and returns the clean text.\n\nTo help you get started immediately, you'll find a **complete, ready-to-use HTML code example** right inside the workflow in a sticky note. This code creates a functional recording interface you can use for testing or as a foundation for your own design.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\n* **Developers:** Quickly add a transcription feature to your application by calling this webhook from your existing frontend or backend code.\n* **No-code/Low-code builders:** Embed a functional audio recorder and transcription service into your projects by using the example code found inside the workflow.\n* **API enthusiasts:** A lean, practical example of how to use n8n to wrap a service like OpenAI into your own secure and scalable API endpoint.\n\n## **What problem does this solve?**\n\n* **Provides a ready-made API:** Instantly gives you a secure webhook to handle audio file uploads and transcription processing without any server setup.\n* **Decouples frontend from backend:** Your application only needs to know about one simple webhook URL, allowing you to change the backend logic in n8n without touching your app's code.\n* **Offers a clear implementation pattern:** The included example code provides a working demonstration of how to send an audio file from a browser and handle the response—a pattern you can replicate in any framework.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis solution works by defining a clear API contract between your application (the client) and the n8n workflow (the backend).\n\n1.  **The client-side technique:**\n    * Your application's interface records or selects an audio file.\n    * It then makes a `POST` request to the n8n webhook URL, sending the audio file as `multipart/form-data`.\n    * It waits for the response from the webhook, parses the JSON body, and extracts the value of the `Transcript` key. You can see this exact pattern in action in the example code provided in the workflow's sticky note.\n\n2.  **The n8n workflow (backend):**\n    * The **Webhook** node catches the incoming `POST` request and grabs the audio file.\n    * The **HTTP Request** node sends this file to the OpenAI API.\n    * The **Set** node isolates the transcript text from the API's response.\n    * The **Respond to Webhook** node sends a clean JSON object (`{\"Transcript\": \"your text here...\"}`) back to your application.\n\n## **Setup**\n\n1.  **Configure the n8n workflow:**\n    * In the **Transcribe with OpenAI** node, add your OpenAI API credentials.\n    * Activate the workflow to enable the endpoint.\n    * Click the \"Copy\" button on the **Webhook** node to get your unique **Production Webhook URL**.\n2.  **Integrate with the frontend:**\n    * Inside the workflow, find the sticky note labeled \"Example Frontend Code Below\". Copy the complete HTML from the note below it.\n    * **⚠️ Important:** In the code you just copied, find the line `const WEBHOOK_URL = 'YOUR WEBHOOK URL';` and replace the placeholder with the Production Webhook URL from n8n.\n    * Save the code as an HTML file and open it in your browser to test.\n\n## **Taking it further**\n\n* **Save transcripts:** Add an **Airtable** or **Google Sheets** node to log every transcript that comes through the workflow.\n* **Error handling:** Enhance the workflow to catch potential errors from the OpenAI API and respond with a clear error message.\n* **Analyze the transcript:** Add a **Language Model** node after the transcription step to summarize the text, classify its sentiment, or extract key entities before sending the response.",
