# 🛠 How It Works

The Daily Calendar Brief is an automated n8n workflow designed to prep you each morning with a rich, executive-style email summary of your day. It pulls data from your calendar, email, and external contact sources to deliver a contextualized, prioritized briefing.

1. Daily Trigger

Runs every weekday morning at 7:00 AM using a schedule node.

2. Calendar Parsing

Grabs all Google Calendar events for the day and extracts details like:
	•	Event title, time, and duration
	•	Full attendee list
	•	Meeting description

3. Attendee Intelligence

Filters for external attendees and:
	•	Scrapes recent email threads with them
	•	Uses Hunter and LinkedIn to enrich attendee info with roles, bios, locations, and recent activity

4. Brief Assembly

Combines:
	•	Event metadata
	•	Attendee research
	•	Recent conversations


5. Email Delivery

Renders the Markdown as HTML and sends a polished email to your inbox with:
	•	Meeting timeline & attendees
	•	Key takeaways & extra context
	•	Conflicts & FYIs
