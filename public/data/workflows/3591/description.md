## Hi, I’m Amanda 🌷
I created this workflow with great care to help you simplify your daily reporting routine. If you manage Meta Ads campaigns, you know how time-consuming it can be to open Ads Manager, filter data, and build client reports.

This automation does all that for you — pulling campaign data by period, calculating key metrics, filtering only what matters, and sending everything via WhatsApp or Email, fully formatted and ready to share.

## What it does

- Collects ad performance data from multiple accounts  
- Filters campaigns and creatives with real results  
- Calculates metrics like CPC, CTR, CPV, conversions, and spend  
- Formats the report clearly and professionally  
- Sends the report via WhatsApp (Evolution API) or Gmail  
- Runs automatically every morning (optional schedule)
