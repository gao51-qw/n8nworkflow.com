Please apply these changes to your workflow in the n8n editor before exporting the JSON for submission:\nRename Nodes to English:\nCron トリガー → Schedule Trigger\nFunction: Slackメッセージ作成 → Format Slack Message\nSlack: 企画ネタ投稿 → Slack Post\nFunction: LLMレスポンス整形 → Parse LLM Response\nMerge Data (統合) → Merge Data\nFunction: データ抽出・5件制限 → Limit to 5 Items\nFunction: Googleデータ抽出 → Extract Google Data\nFunction: Facebookデータ抽出 → Extract FB Data\nTranslate Code Comments & Prompts:\nInside the Code nodes, ensure comments are in English (e.g., // Slackへの投稿メッセージを作成します → // Create message for Slack).\nInside the AI Agent node, translate the System Prompt into English (e.g., \"You are a professional content planner...\" instead of \"あなたはプロの...\"). Even if you want the output in Japanese, the template default should usually be English, or clearly labeled as a Japanese template.\nAdd the Mandatory Sticky Note:\nAdd a Yellow Sticky Note to the canvas.\nPaste the \"Description\" text (from step 2 above) into this sticky note.\nPlace it clearly next to the start of the workflow.\nRemove Hardcoded IDs:\nEnsure MASKED_USER_ID and MASKED_WEBHOOK_ID are cleared out or set to expressions that reference the user's setup.",
