## How to customize the workflow

- **Change report format**: Update the final LLM Chain prompt to adjust report structure
- **Add notifications**: Insert Slack or email nodes after report generation
- **Adjust confidence thresholds**: Modify validators to change profile verification requirements
- **Alternative outputs**: Replace Google Docs with PDF, Excel, or webhook to CRM
