  "description": "## Who's it for\n\nSmall online store owners, new entrepreneurs, and anyone getting started with e-commerce automation. Perfect for beginners who want to automate their order process without complexity or additional costs. Ideal for stores using Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy, or any platform that supports webhooks.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis simple workflow automatically handles new orders by sending professional confirmation emails to customers and notification emails to your team. When a customer places an order, your e-commerce platform sends the order data to this workflow via webhook.\n\nThe system extracts essential order information like customer details, order number, and total amount, then validates the data to ensure completeness. It sends a beautifully formatted confirmation email to the customer with order details, next steps, and your contact information. Simultaneously, your team receives an order notification email with all the details needed to process and fulfill the order.\n\nThe workflow includes error handling for incomplete orders and sends appropriate responses back to your e-commerce platform to confirm successful processing. Everything is logged for easy tracking and troubleshooting.\n\n## How to set up\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- An online store (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)\n- Gmail account or any email service with SMTP\n- 5 minutes for setup\n\n**Setup steps:**\n\n1. **Configure your store information:**\n   - Open the \"Store Configuration\" node\n   - Update with your store name, email addresses, phone number, and website\n   - This information appears in customer emails and notifications\n\n2. **Set up email credentials:**\n   - Add your Gmail account or SMTP email service to n8n\n   - Use the built-in email credential setup\n   - Gmail is free and works perfectly for most small stores\n\n3. **Copy the webhook URL:**\n   - Click on the \"New Order Webhook\" node\n   - Copy the webhook URL that appears\n   - This is where your store will send order data\n\n4. **Add webhook to your store:**\n   - **Shopify**: Go to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Webhooks, create new webhook for \"Order creation\"\n   - **WooCommerce**: WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Webhooks, add new webhook for \"Order created\"\n   - **Other platforms**: Look for webhook, API, or integration settings\n\n5. **Test the workflow:**\n   - Place a test order in your store\n   - Check that confirmation email was sent to customer\n   - Verify team notification email was received\n   - Confirm webhook response shows success\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **E-commerce platform** with webhook support (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Etsy, etc.)\n- **Email account** - Gmail (free) or any SMTP email service\n- **n8n instance** - cloud subscription or self-hosted installation\n- **Basic store information** - contact details and branding\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n**Personalize email content:**\n- Edit the email templates in the \"Send Customer Confirmation\" and \"Send Team Notification\" nodes\n- Add your brand voice and specific messaging\n- Include additional order details or shipping information\n- Add your logo or signature (if using HTML email)\n\n**Modify order validation:**\n- Adjust validation rules in the \"Validate Order Data\" node\n- Add checks for minimum order amounts\n- Include product-specific validation\n- Set up different handling for different order types\n\n**Enhance team notifications:**\n- Add team member-specific routing based on order value or products\n- Include inventory alerts for low-stock items\n- Add urgency flags for rush orders\n- Set up different notification schedules for weekends vs weekdays\n\n**Extend functionality:**\n- Add SMS notifications using Twilio for urgent orders\n- Include automated inventory updates\n- Set up follow-up email sequences for customer engagement\n- Add order status updates as items are processed and shipped\n\n**Integration improvements:**\n- Connect with Google Sheets to log all orders automatically\n- Add Slack notifications for team collaboration\n- Integrate with shipping services for automatic label creation\n- Link to accounting software for financial tracking\n\nThis template focuses on simplicity and reliability, using only built-in n8n nodes and free services to get new store owners started with automation quickly and affordably.",
