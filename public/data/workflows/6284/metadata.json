  "description": "# 🏦 GoCardless ⇄ Maybe Finance — Automatic Multi-Bank Sync & Weekly Overview 💸\n\n### Who’s it for 🤔\nFreelancers, founders, households, and side-hustlers who work with several bank accounts but want **one, always-up-to-date budget** inside Maybe Finance—no more CSV exports or copy-paste.\n\n---\n\n### How it works / What it does ⚙️\n1. **Schedule Trigger** (cron) fires every Monday 📅  \n   *(switch to Manual Trigger while testing)*  \n2. **Get access token** — fresh 24 h GoCardless token 🔑  \n3. **Fetch transactions** for each account:  \n   - Revolut Pro  \n   - Revolut Personal  \n   - ABN AMRO  \n   *(add extra HTTP Request nodes for any other GoCardless-supported banks)*  \n4. **Extract booked** — keep only settled items 🗂️  \n5. **Set transactions …** — map every record to Maybe Finance’s schema 📝  \n6. **Merge all arrays** into one payload 🔄  \n7. **Create transactions to Maybe** — POSTs each item via API 🚀  \n8. **Resend Email** — sends you a “Weekly transactions overview” 📧\n\nAll done in a single run — your Maybe dashboard is refreshed and you get an inbox alert.\n\n---\n\n### How to set up 🛠️\n1. **Import** the template into n8n (cloud or self-hosted).  \n2. **Create credentials**  \n   - GoCardless `secret_id` & `secret_key`  \n   - Maybe Finance API key  \n   - (Optional) Resend API key for email notifications  \n3. **One-time GoCardless config** (run the blocks on the left):  \n   1. `/token/new/` → obtain token  \n   2. `/institutions` → find institution IDs  \n   3. `/agreements/enduser/` → create agreements  \n   4. `/requisitions/` → get the consent URL & finish bank login  \n   5. `/requisitions/{id}` → copy the GoCardless `account_id`s  \n4. **Create the same accounts in Maybe Finance** and run the HTTP GET request in the purple frame and copy their `account_id`s.  \n5. Open each **Set transactions …** node and paste the correct Maybe `account_id`.  \n6. Adjust the **Schedule Trigger** (e.g. daily, monthly).  \n7. **Save & activate** 🎉\n\n---\n\n### Requirements 📋\n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- GoCardless app (secret ID & key, live or sandbox)  \n- Maybe Finance account & API key  \n- (Optional) Resend account for email\n\n---\n\n### How to customize ✨\n- **Include pending transactions**: change the Item Lists filter.  \n- **Add more banks**: duplicate the “Get … transactions” → “Extract booked” → “Set transactions” path and plug its output into the Merge node.  \n- **Different interval**: edit the cron rule in Schedule Trigger.  \n- **Disable emails**: just remove or deactivate the Resend node.  \n- **Send alerts to Slack / Teams**: branch after the Merge node and add a chat node.\n\nHappy budgeting! 💰",
