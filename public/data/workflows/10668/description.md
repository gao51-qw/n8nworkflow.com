## Enrich Profiles directly in Google Sheet !

This n8n template shows how to enrich Google spreadsheet with LinkedIn profiles automatically using the Apify LinkedIn Profile Enrichment actor from [Anchor](https://apify.com/anchor). It will create a new sheet with the enriched data.

You can use it to build lead enrichment workflows, update your CRM records, or personalize outreach campaigns — all directly inside n8n.

- The results are then stored in a new Google Sheet

### How to use
In Google Sheet:
- Create a Google sheet, rename the sheet "profiles" and add all the LinkedIn URLs you want to enrich (one url per row)


In this Workflow:
- Open the "Set google sheet URL & orginial sheet name" and replace the example Google sheet URL, and the name of the sheet where your LinkedIn URLs are  


In the n8n credentials:  
- Connect your Google Sheet account, with read and write privileges for google sheets
- Connect to your Apify account
