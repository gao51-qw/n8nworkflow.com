# AI Real Estate Agent with OpenRouter and SrpAPI to talk with property objects from propertyfinder.ae

This n8n template demonstrates a simple AI Agent that can:

* Scrape information from a provided `propertyfinder.ae` listing link.
* Answer questions about a specific property using the scraped information.
* Use **SerpAPI** to find details that are missing from the scraped data.
* Answer general real-estate questions using **SerpAPI**.

## Use Case

This workflow serves as a starting point for building complex AI assistants for real estate or other domains.

## Potential Enhancements

* **Expand Knowledge:** Augment the workflow with your own knowledge base using a vector database (RAG approach).
* **Add More Sources:** Adapt the scraper to support other real estate websites.
* **Optimize Speed:** Add a cache for scraped data to reduce response latency.
* **Improve Context Handling:** Implement reliable persistence to track the current listing instead of iterating through conversation history.
* **Customize Prompts:** Write more tailored prompts for your specific needs (the current one is for demonstration only).
* **Integrate Channels:** Connect the workflow to communication channels like Instagram, Telegram, or WhatsApp.

## How It Works

1.  The workflow is triggered by a **"When chat message received"** node for simple demonstration.
2.  The **`Chat Memory Manager`** node extracts the last 30 messages for the current session.
3.  A code node finds the property link, first by checking the most recent user message and then by searching the conversation history.
4.  If a link is found, an **`HTTP Request`** node scrapes the HTML content from the listing page.
5.  The **`Summarize`** code node parses the HTML, retrieves key information, and passes it to the AI Agent as a temporary knowledge base.
6.  The final **`AI Agent`** node answers user queries using the scraped knowledge base and falls back to the **SerpAPI** tool when information is missing.

## How to Use

* You can test this workflow directly in n8n or integrate it into any social media channel or your website.
* The `AI Agent` node is configured to use **OpenRouter**. Add your **OpenRouter** credentials, or replace the node with your preferred LLM provider.
* Add your **SerpAPI** key to the `SerpAPI` tool within the AI Agent node.

---

## Requirements

* An API key for **OpenRouter** (or credentials for your preferred LLM provider).
* A **SerpAPI** key. You can get one from their website; a free plan is available for testing.
