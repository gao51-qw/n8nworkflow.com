  "description": "# AI Real Estate Agent with OpenRouter and SrpAPI to talk with property objects from propertyfinder.ae\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates a simple AI Agent that can:\n\n* Scrape information from a provided `propertyfinder.ae` listing link.\n* Answer questions about a specific property using the scraped information.\n* Use **SerpAPI** to find details that are missing from the scraped data.\n* Answer general real-estate questions using **SerpAPI**.\n\n---\n\n## Use Case\n\nThis workflow serves as a starting point for building complex AI assistants for real estate or other domains.\n\n[See the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WqudWmczjVU)\n---\n\n## Potential Enhancements\n\n* **Expand Knowledge:** Augment the workflow with your own knowledge base using a vector database (RAG approach).\n* **Add More Sources:** Adapt the scraper to support other real estate websites.\n* **Optimize Speed:** Add a cache for scraped data to reduce response latency.\n* **Improve Context Handling:** Implement reliable persistence to track the current listing instead of iterating through conversation history.\n* **Customize Prompts:** Write more tailored prompts for your specific needs (the current one is for demonstration only).\n* **Integrate Channels:** Connect the workflow to communication channels like Instagram, Telegram, or WhatsApp.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  The workflow is triggered by a **\"When chat message received\"** node for simple demonstration.\n2.  The **`Chat Memory Manager`** node extracts the last 30 messages for the current session.\n3.  A code node finds the property link, first by checking the most recent user message and then by searching the conversation history.\n4.  If a link is found, an **`HTTP Request`** node scrapes the HTML content from the listing page.\n5.  The **`Summarize`** code node parses the HTML, retrieves key information, and passes it to the AI Agent as a temporary knowledge base.\n6.  The final **`AI Agent`** node answers user queries using the scraped knowledge base and falls back to the **SerpAPI** tool when information is missing.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n* You can test this workflow directly in n8n or integrate it into any social media channel or your website.\n* The `AI Agent` node is configured to use **OpenRouter**. Add your **OpenRouter** credentials, or replace the node with your preferred LLM provider.\n* Add your **SerpAPI** key to the `SerpAPI` tool within the AI Agent node.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* An API key for **OpenRouter** (or credentials for your preferred LLM provider).\n* A **SerpAPI** key. You can get one from their website; a free plan is available for testing.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help Building Something More?\n\nContact me on:\n* **Telegram:** @ninesfork\n* **LinkedIn:** [George Zargaryan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-zargaryan-b65290367/)\n\nHappy Hacking! 🚀",
