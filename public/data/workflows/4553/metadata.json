Import the workflow to your n8n instance  \n2. (Optional) Configure your LLM (OpenAI or Ollama) in the “OpenAI Chat Model” node   \n3. Type your business idea (e.g., “Luxury dog collar brand for Instagram dads”)  \n5. Wait for flow completion\n6. Download the final marketing plan file  \n\n🤖 LLM Flexibility (Choose Your Model)\n- Supports any LLM via LangChain:  \n  - Ollama (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral, DeepSeek)  \n  - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)  \n- To switch models, just replace the “Language Model” node, no other logic needs updating  \n\n\n\n📌 Notes\n- Output is professional and ready-to-pitch  \n- Built-in pessimistic validator filters out bad ideas before wasting time  \n\n📩 Need help?\nEmail: sinamirshafiee@gmail.com  \nHappy to support setup or customization!",
