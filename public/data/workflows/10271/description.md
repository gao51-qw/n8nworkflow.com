# Weekly hiring‑manager snapshot from Breezy HR to email (pipeline, next‑week interviews, stuck)

This workflow sends each **hiring manager** a single weekly email with an overview of their open roles: **pipeline totals**, a **per‑position** summary, **interviews scheduled next week** and **stuck candidates** (no movement ≥ 7 days). It queries **Breezy HR** using your API token, detects the HM via each position’s **team** (falling back to a simple map when unavailable), aggregates results and emails one digest per HM. The job runs **Mondays at 07:30 Asia/Kolkata**, includes a **DRY_RUN** preview and rate‑limits sends.

## Who’s it for
- Hiring managers who want a **once‑a‑week** snapshot instead of many separate updates. 
- Talent/recruiting teams using **Breezy HR** who need **pipeline hygiene** and **next‑week readiness** at a glance. 
- Ops partners who prefer a standardized email with HTML tables and a text fallback.

## How it works
1. **Cron (Mon 07:30 IST)** triggers weekly. 
2. **Breezy → Positions**: Fetch open positions (configurable). 
3. **Find HM**: For each position, read the **position team** and look for a member with a “hiring manager” role; if none, use the **fallback map**. 
4. **Candidates per position**: Fetch candidates, compute **stage counts** and mark **stuck** where last activity ≥ `STUCK_AFTER_DAYS`. 
5. **Events per position**: Fetch events and keep those that look like **interviews** scheduled **next calendar week**. 
6. **Aggregate** per position → **Group** by hiring manager → **Build** one HTML digest per HM. 
7. **DRY_RUN?** If true, output a preview only; otherwise **send emails** with a small delay between each.

## How to set up
1. **Credentials in n8n**
   - **HTTP Header Auth** for Breezy HR: set `Authorization: Bearer &lt;YOUR_TOKEN&gt;` in a credential (don’t hardcode in the node). 
   - **SMTP (Gmail)** to send digests.
2. **Open “Set: Config”** (single place to edit)
   - `BREEZY_API_BASE` = `https://api.breezy.hr/v3` 
   - `COMPANY_ID` = your Breezy company ID 
   - `TIMEZONE` = `Asia/Kolkata` 
   - `INCLUDE_ONLY_OPEN` = `true` (use `STATE_FILTER` = `open`) 
   - `USE_BREEZY_HM_DETECTION` = `true` 
   - `HM_FALLBACK_MAP_JSON` = e.g., `{ "Default": "hm@example.com", "Java TL": "javatl@company.com" }` 
   - `STUCK_AFTER_DAYS` = `7` 
   - `INTERVIEW_EVENT_KEYWORDS_CSV` = `interview` 
   - `SMTP_FROM` = sender address 
   - `SUBJECT_TEMPLATE` = `Weekly HM snapshot {{range}} — {{positions_count}} roles, {{candidates_count}} candidates` 
   - `INTRO_TEMPLATE` / `OUTRO_TEMPLATE` 
   - `DRY_RUN` = `false` (set `true` to preview) 
   - `RATE_LIMIT_EMAIL_SECONDS` = `5`
3. **Activate** the workflow.

## Requirements
- Breezy HR API token with access to positions, teams, candidates and events. 
- SMTP (Gmail) account to send emails. 
- n8n (cloud or self‑hosted) with HTTP Header Auth and SMTP credentials.

## How to customize
- **Schedule:** Change Cron to your preferred day/time. 
- **Scope:** Set `INCLUDE_ONLY_OPEN=false` to include other position states. 
- **Interview detection:** Edit `INTERVIEW_EVENT_KEYWORDS_CSV` to match your account’s event labels. 
- **Stuck threshold:** Adjust `STUCK_AFTER_DAYS` (e.g., 10 or 14). 
- **Templates:** Update `SUBJECT_TEMPLATE`, `INTRO_TEMPLATE`, `OUTRO_TEMPLATE`. 
- **Fallback mapping:** Expand `HM_FALLBACK_MAP_JSON` for positions lacking team data.

## Add‑ons
- **Slack delivery:** Post a weekly summary to a channel or DM the HM alongside the email. 
- **CSV attachments:** Attach per‑HM CSV of positions/candidates for offline work. 
- **Manager CC:** CC a recruiting lead or HRBP for visibility on key roles. 
- **Writeback:** Log weekly metrics to **Google Sheets** for dashboards. 
- **Custom windows:** Use a different future window (e.g., interviews in the next 2 weeks).

## Use Case Examples
- **Busy HMs** who want one email showing **where to focus** for the coming week. 
- **Recruiting Ops** keeping tabs on **pipeline health** and stalled candidates. 
- **Leadership reviews** where weekly snapshots feed into Monday stand‑ups.

## Common troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| No emails sent | `DRY_RUN=true` | Set `DRY_RUN=false` to send. |
| Missing HM recipients | Team endpoint returned no “hiring manager” and fallback map not configured | Add position→email in `HM_FALLBACK_MAP_JSON` (or set a better default). |
| Interviews list is empty | Different event label in your Breezy account | Add your labels to `INTERVIEW_EVENT_KEYWORDS_CSV` (comma‑separated). |
| Stuck candidates not flagged | Threshold too high or activity timestamps missing | Lower `STUCK_AFTER_DAYS` or verify candidate activity data. |
| API errors | Bad token or insufficient scopes | Recreate the Breezy credential with a valid Bearer token. |
| Emails fail to send | SMTP auth/quota issues | Check SMTP credentials/from‑address permissions and provider limits. |
