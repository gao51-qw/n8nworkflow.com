[![Watch the video](https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/multi-agent-book-creation-workflow-with-ai-tool-node-and-gpt-4-dall-e.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1x8Tw_7FwQ)

## **Who’s it for**
This workflow is designed for:
- **Content creators** who want to generate books or structured documents automatically.  
- **Educators and trainers** who need quick course materials, eBooks, or study guides.  
- **Automation enthusiasts** exploring **multi-agent systems** using the newly released **AI Tool Node** in n8n.  
- **Developers** looking for a reference template to understand **orchestration of multiple AI agents** with structured output.  

## **How it works / What it does**
This template demonstrates a **multi-agent orchestration system** powered by AI Tool Nodes:  
1. **Trigger**: Workflow starts when a chat message is received.  
2. **Book Brief Agent**: Generates the initial book concept (title, subtitle, and outline).  
3. **Book Writer Agent**: Expands the outline into full content by collaborating with two sub-agents:  
   - **Designer Agent** → Provides layout/design suggestions.  
   - **Content Writer Agent** → Drafts and refines chapters.  
4. **Generate Cover Image**: AI generates a custom book cover image.  
5. **Upload to AWS S3**: Stores the cover image securely.  
6. **Configure Metadata**: Adds metadata for title, author, and description.  
7. **Build Book HTML**: Converts markdown-based content into HTML format.  
8. **Upload to Google Drive**: Saves the HTML content for processing.  
9. **Convert to PDF**: Transforms the book into a professional PDF.  
10. **Archive to Google Drive**: Final version is archived for safe storage.  

This workflow showcases **multi-agent coordination, structured parsing, and seamless integration** with cloud storage services.  

## **How to set up**
1. **Import the workflow** into n8n.  
2. Configure the following connections:  
   - **OpenAI** (for Book Brief, Book Writer, Designer, and Content Writer Agents).  
   - **AWS S3** (for image storage).  
   - **Google Drive** (for document storage & archiving).  
3. Add your API keys and credentials in **n8n credentials manager**.  
4. Test the workflow by sending a sample chat message (e.g., *“Write a book about AI in education”*).  
5. Verify outputs in Google Drive (HTML + PDF) and AWS S3 (cover image).  

## **Requirements**
- **n8n** (latest version with **AI Tool Node** support).  
- **OpenAI API key** (to power multi-agent models).  
- **AWS account** (with S3 bucket for storing images).  
- **Google Drive integration** (for document storage and archiving).  
- Basic familiarity with **workflow setup in n8n**.  

## **How to customize the workflow**
- **Switch Models**: Replace `gpt-4.1-mini` with other models (faster, cheaper, or more powerful).  
- **Add More Agents**: Introduce agents for **editing, fact-checking, or translation**.  
- **Change Output Format**: Export to **EPUB, DOCX, or Markdown** instead of PDF.  
- **Branding Options**: Modify the **cover generation prompt** to include company logos or specific style.  
- **Extend Storage**: Add **Dropbox, OneDrive, or Notion** integration for additional archiving.  
- **Trigger Alternatives**: Replace chat trigger with **form submission, webhook, or schedule-based runs**.  

✅ This workflow acts as a **free, plug-and-play template** to showcase how **multi-agents + AI Tool Node** can work together to automate complex content creation pipelines.
