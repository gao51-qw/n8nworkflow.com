## How it Works
- This n8n template makes it possible to send emails directly from your Obsidian notes. 
- It leverages the power of the [Obsidian Post Webhook plugin](https://github.com/Masterb1234/obsidian-post-webhook/), allowing seamless integration between your notes and the email workflow. 

## What it does:
- Receives note content and metadata from Obsidian via a Webhook.
- Parses YAML frontmatter to define email recipients, subject, and more.
- Automatically processes attachments, encoding them into an email-friendly format.
- Sends emails via Gmail and confirms the status back to Obsidian.
- Includes a testing feature to verify everything works before going live.

## Set-up Steps
- Webhook Configuration: Set your n8n POST Webhook URL in the Obsidian [Obsidian Post Webhook plugin](https://github.com/Masterb1234/obsidian-post-webhook/) settings.
- Email Integration: Submit the Gmail credentials in n8n email nodes.
- Test the Workflow: Run a test from Obsidian to ensure the template functions correctly.
- Activate and Enjoy: Start sending customized emails with attachments from your notes in no time!
