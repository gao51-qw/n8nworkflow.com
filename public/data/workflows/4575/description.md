This n8n workflow provides a robust solution for Hostinger website owners looking to streamline their lead capture and qualification process. By integrating AI and popular marketing tools, it ensures efficient management of new leads.

### How it works

This workflow automates the process of capturing leads from a Hostinger website form, qualifying them using an AI model, and syncing them with Beehiiv and Google Sheets.

* A new form submission on your Hostinger website triggers the workflow via Gmail.
* An AI model (OpenAI) extracts and qualifies relevant data from the form response, transforming it into a structured JSON format.
* The qualified lead is then added as a new subscriber to your Beehiiv newsletter.
* Finally, the lead information is appended to a Google Sheet for comprehensive tracking and record-keeping.

### Set up steps

* Create an account on [Hostinger](https://hostinger.es?REFERRALCODE=6MKHELLOUQOS) and set up a form on your website.
* Configure a Gmail trigger to capture form submissions from your Hostinger email sender.
* Ensure your email is mapped correctly for the Hostinger sender.
* Set up your OpenAI API key for the "Extract & Qualify Message Model" node.
* Create an account on [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com?via=1node-ai). Obtain your Beehiiv API key and create your credentials.
* Set up a Google Sheet and configure the "insert in Sheets" node with the correct mapping.

#### Approximate setup time: 15-30 minutes
