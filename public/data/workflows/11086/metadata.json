  "description": "# Olostep Google Maps Lead Generation Automation  \n\nThis n8n template automates lead generation by scraping Google Maps using the Olostep API.  \nIt extracts **business names, locations, websites, phone numbers, and decision-maker names** (CEO, Founder, etc.) directly from the business website — and saves everything into a Google Sheet.\n\n## Who’s it for  \n- Marketers and agencies doing local business outreach.  \n- SaaS founders looking for prospects.  \n- Freelancers and growth hackers scraping Google Maps leads.  \n- Anyone who wants automated business research without manual data entry.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Form Trigger:**  \n   - User submits a form with: **City** + **Business Type** (e.g., \"Dentist in Miami\").\n\n2. **Google Maps Scraping:**  \n   - The workflow sends the query to the Olostep scraping API.  \n   - Extracts:  \n     - Business name  \n     - Location  \n     - Website  \n     - Phone number  \n\n3. **Clean the Data:**  \n   - Parsed JSON is split into items.  \n   - A Remove Duplicates node ensures only unique leads continue.\n\n4. **Loop Through Each Business:**  \n   - For every business, the workflow triggers a second Olostep scrape — this time on the **business’s website**.  \n   - It extracts:  \n     - First name of decision-maker  \n     - Last name of decision-maker  \n     - (Optional) general contact email found on the website\n\n5. **Store the Lead:**  \n   - The final combined lead is appended to a Google Sheet with these fields:  \n     - Business Name  \n     - Location  \n     - Website  \n     - Phone Number  \n     - Decision-Maker Name  \n     - Contact Email (if found)  \n\n6. **Loop & Wait:**  \n   - A wait step ensures you stay within rate limits while scraping multiple websites.\n\nThis produces a clean, enriched list of leads ready for outreach or CRM import.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import the template into your n8n workspace.  \n2. Add your **Olostep API key**.  \n3. Connect **Google Sheets** for output storage.  \n4. Publish your form to collect search requests.  \n5. Run the workflow — leads will appear automatically in your sheet.\n\n## Requirements  \n- Olostep API key.  \n- Google Sheets account.  \n- n8n account or self-hosted instance.\n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- Add CRM destinations (HubSpot, Airtable, Notion).  \n- Expand LLM-extraction to capture: social links, descriptions, ratings, etc.  \n- Add validation rules before saving a lead.  \n- Enable notification steps (Telegram, Slack) when batches finish.  \n- Add additional enrichment steps (e.g., scrape About pages, contact pages, multiple URLs).\n\n---\n\n👉 This workflow gives you a complete lead generation system from Google Maps + business website analysis — with no manual scraping needed.  \n",
