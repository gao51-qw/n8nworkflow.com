This automation template turns any RSS feed into ready-to-publish social content using AI. It continuously ingests articles, scores their quality and relevance, crafts platform-native posts (Twitter/X threads and LinkedIn posts), routes items for review or archiving, logs everything to Google Sheets, and can publish automatically to X, Threads, and LinkedIn.

***Note: This workflow uses OpenAI models for analysis and content generation and integrates with Upload-Post for multi-platform publishing and Google Sheets for tracking. Costs depend on token usage and posting volume.***

## Who Is This For?
- **Content Teams & Solo Creators:** Ship consistent, high-signal posts without manual rewriting.
- **Newsletters & Media Brands:** Turn breaking stories into shareable, platform-native content.
- **Agencies:** Scale curation across clients with review and auto-publish paths.
- **Founders & PMMs:** Maintain a steady public presence with minimal effort.

## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?
Manual curation and rewriting of news is slow and inconsistent. This workflow:
- **Scores Articles:** Filters noise with AI quality/relevance scoring.
- **Auto-Writes Posts:** Generates concise X threads and business-ready LinkedIn copy.
- **Routes Intelligently:** Sends good items to publish/review and archives the rest.
- **Logs Everything:** Keeps a structured history in Google Sheets for analytics.

## How It Works
1. **RSS Polling:** Monitors your chosen feed(s) on a schedule.
2. **Scoring AI:** Rates quality and relevance; extracts summary, key topics, and angle.
3. **Parse & Enrich:** Normalizes AI output and merges with article metadata.
4. **Quality Gates:** Directs items to “publish/review” or “archive.”
5. **Content Generation:** Produces an X thread and a LinkedIn post with clear hooks and insights.
6. **Publishing:** Uploads to X, Threads, and LinkedIn via Upload-Post (optional).
7. **Sheets Logging:** Writes summaries, scores, and outputs to Google Sheets.

## Setup
1. **OpenAI API:** Add your OpenAI credentials (models like `gpt-4.1`/`gpt-4o`).
2. **Upload-Post Credentials:** Connect the Upload-Post integration and target pages (e.g., LinkedIn org ID).
3. **Google Sheets:** Add OAuth credentials and point “Store Content”/“New for Review”/“Archive” to your sheets.
4. **RSS Feed URL:** Replace the sample feed with your preferred sources.
5. **Thresholds & Routing:** Adjust quality/relevance filters to your standards.
6. **Publishing Mode:** Toggle platforms (X, Threads, LinkedIn) and decide auto vs. review-first.

## Requirements
- **Accounts:** n8n, OpenAI, Upload-Post, Google account (Sheets).
