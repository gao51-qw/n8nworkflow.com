  "description": "![image.png](fileId:3008)\n\nThis automation template turns any RSS feed into ready-to-publish social content using AI. It continuously ingests articles, scores their quality and relevance, crafts platform-native posts (Twitter/X threads and LinkedIn posts), routes items for review or archiving, logs everything to Google Sheets, and can publish automatically to X, Threads, and LinkedIn.\n\n***Note: This workflow uses OpenAI models for analysis and content generation and integrates with Upload-Post for multi-platform publishing and Google Sheets for tracking. Costs depend on token usage and posting volume.***\n\n## Who Is This For?\n- **Content Teams & Solo Creators:** Ship consistent, high-signal posts without manual rewriting.\n- **Newsletters & Media Brands:** Turn breaking stories into shareable, platform-native content.\n- **Agencies:** Scale curation across clients with review and auto-publish paths.\n- **Founders & PMMs:** Maintain a steady public presence with minimal effort.\n\n## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nManual curation and rewriting of news is slow and inconsistent.
