  "description": "## Who it’s for\n\nThis workflow is for content creators and marketers who write short scripts in Google Sheets and want to automatically turn each line into an AI-generated avatar video stored in Google Drive, with links written back to the sheet.\n\n## How it works\n\nA **Manual Trigger** starts the workflow. It first uses **Get Avatar Description** (Google Sheets) to read avatar details from a dedicated “Gaia” sheet. The **Global Variables** node sets the working script page (for example, “Draft 5”) and exposes the avatar description.\nNext, **Get Script** reads all rows from the selected sheet. **Loop Over Items** iterates through each row, while **Set Loop Inputs** prepares the variables: avatar description, speech, and framing.\nFor every row, **Generate a video with Veo** (Google Gemini video model) creates an 8-second 16:9 clip. **Upload video file** saves it to a chosen Google Drive folder, and **Update row in sheet with link to video** writes the Drive link back into the same row, then loops to the next snippet.\nYellow sticky notes explain each phase, with the large one summarizing the end-to-end snippet generation loop.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect your Google Sheets and Google Drive credentials.\n2. Update the spreadsheet IDs, sheet names, and Drive folder to match your own.\n3. Configure the Gemini/Veo model credentials.\n4. Adjust the default script page name in **Global Variables**.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* n8n instance\n* Google Sheets and Google Drive accounts\n* Google Gemini / Veo API access\n  No API keys or personal identifiers are hardcoded; always store credentials securely in n8n and avoid real PII in test data.\n\n## How to customize\n\n* Change the **page** value in **Global Variables** to target different script tabs.\n* Edit the Veo prompt to alter background, camera framing, or speaking style.\n* Modify video duration, aspect ratio, or output folder in the Gemini and Drive nodes.\n* Extend the loop to add more post-processing steps (e.g., thumbnail generation, analytics tracking).\n",
