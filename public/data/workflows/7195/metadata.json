  "description": "## What this workflow is (About)\n\nThis workflow turns a Telegram bot into an **AI-powered lyrics assistant**. Users send a command plus a **lyrics URL**, and the flow **downloads, cleans, and analyzes** the text, then replies on Telegram with translated lyrics, summaries, vocabulary, poetic devices, or an interpretation—**all generated by AI (OpenAI)**.\n\n## What problems it solves\n\n* Centralizes **lyrics retrieval + cleanup + AI analysis** in one automated flow\n* Produces **study-ready outputs** (translation, vocabulary, figures of speech)\n* Saves time for **teachers, learners, and music enthusiasts** with instant results in chat\n\n## Key features\n\n* **AI analysis** using OpenAI (no secrets hardcoded; uses n8n Credentials)\n* **Line-by-line translation**, **concise summaries**, **vocabulary lists**\n* **Poetic/literary device detection** and **emotional/symbolic interpretation**\n* Robust **ETL** (extract, download, sanitize) and **error handling**\n* Clear **Sticky Notes** documenting routing, ETL, AI prompts, and messaging\n\n## Who it’s for\n\n* Language learners & teachers\n* Musicians, lyricists, and music bloggers\n* Anyone studying lyrics for meaning, style, or vocabulary\n\n## Input & output\n\n* **Input:** Telegram command with a public **lyrics URL**\n* **Output:** Telegram messages (Markdown/MarkdownV2), split into chunks if long\n\n## How it works\n\n* **Telegram → Webhook** receives a user message (e.g., `/get_lyrics &lt;URL&gt;`).\n* **Routing (If/Switch)** detects which command was sent.\n* **Extract URL + Download (HTTP Request)** fetches the lyrics page.\n* **Cleanup (Code)** strips HTML/scripts/styles and normalizes whitespace.\n* **OpenAI (Chat)** formats the result per command (translation, summary, vocabulary, analysis).\n* **Telegram (Send Message)** returns the final text; long outputs are split into chunks.\n* **Error handling** replies with friendly guidance for unsupported/incomplete commands.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. **Create a Telegram bot** with **@BotFather** and copy the bot token.\n2. In n8n, create **Credentials → Telegram API** and paste your token (no hardcoded keys in nodes).\n3. Create **Credentials → OpenAI** and paste your API key.\n4. **Import the workflow** and set a short webhook path (e.g., `/lyrics-bot`).\n5. **Publish** the webhook and set it on Telegram:\n\n   ```text\n   https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;YOUR_BOT_TOKEN&gt;/setWebhook?url=https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/webhook/lyrics-bot\n   ```\n6. (Optional) Restrict update types:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;YOUR_BOT_TOKEN&gt;/setWebhook \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n       \"url\": \"https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/webhook/lyrics-bot\",\n       \"allowed_updates\": [\"message\"]\n     }'\n   ```\n7. **Test** by sending `/start` and then `/get_lyrics &lt;PUBLIC_URL&gt;` to your bot.\n8. If messages are long, ensure **MarkdownV2** is used and special characters are escaped.\n",
