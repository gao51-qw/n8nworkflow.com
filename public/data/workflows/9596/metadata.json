  "description": "### **Automated Blog Monitoring System with RSS Feeds and Time-Based Filtering**\n\n## Overview\n\nThis workflow provides a powerful yet simple foundation for monitoring blogs using **RSS feeds**. It automatically fetches articles from a list of your favorite blogs and filters them based on their publication date, separating new content from old. It is the perfect starting point for anyone looking to build a custom content aggregation or notification system without needing any API keys.\n\nThis template is designed for **developers**, **hobbyists**, and **marketers** who want a reliable way to track new blog posts and then decide what to do with them. Instead of including a specific final step, this workflow intentionally ends with a filter, giving you complete freedom to add your own integrations.\n\n-----\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWhy would you need to monitor and filter blog posts?\n\n  * **Build a Custom News Feed:** Send new articles that match your interests directly to a Discord channel, Slack, or Telegram chat.\n  * **Power a Newsletter:** Automatically collect links and summaries from industry blogs to curate your weekly newsletter content.\n  * **Create a Social Media Queue:** Add new, relevant blog posts to a content calendar or social media scheduling tool like Buffer or Hootsuite.\n  * **Archive Content:** Save new articles to a personal database like Airtable, Notion, or Google Sheets to build a searchable knowledge base.\n\n-----\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Manual Trigger:** The workflow starts when you click \"Execute Workflow\". You can easily swap this for a **Schedule Trigger** to run it automatically.\n2.  **Fetch RSS Feeds:** It reads a list of RSS feed URLs that you provide in the **\"blogs to track\"** node.\n3.  **Process Each Feed:** The workflow loops through each RSS feed individually.\n4.  **Filter by Date:** It checks the publication date of every article and compares it to a timeframe you set (default is 60 days).\n5.  **Split New from Old:**\n      * **New articles** are sent down the **`true`** path of the **\"Filter Out Old Blogs\"** node.\n      * **Old articles** are sent down the **`false`** path.\n      * This workflow leaves the `true` path empty so you can add your desired next steps.\n\n-----\n\n## Setup and Customization\n\nThis workflow requires minimal setup and is designed for easy customization.\n\n1.  **Add Your Blog Feeds:**\n\n      * Find the **\"blogs to track\"** node.\n      * In the `source_identifier` field, replace the example URLs with the RSS feeds you want to monitor.\n\n    \n\n    ```javascript\n    // Add your target RSS feed URLs in this array\n    ['https://blog.n8n.io/rss', 'https://zapier.com/blog/feeds/latest/']\n    ```\n\n2.  **Set the Time Filter:**\n\n      * Go to the **\"max\\_content\\_age\\_days\"** node.\n      * Change the value from the default `60` to your desired number of days. For example, use `7` to only get articles published in the last week.\n\n3.  **Customize Your Output (Required Next Step):**\n\n      * This is the most important part\\! Drag a new node and connect it to the **`true`** output of the **\"Filter Out Old Blogs\"** node.\n      * **Example Idea:** To save new articles to a Google Sheet, add a **Split In Batches** node followed by a **Google Sheets** node to append each new article as a new row.",
