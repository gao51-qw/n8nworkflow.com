  "description": "### AI Email Manager: Auto Summary, Labeling, and CRM Logging via n8n + Gemini\n\n### Overview\n\nThis workflow turns your Gmail inbox into a fully autonomous AI Email Agent that reads, summarizes, categorizes, and organizes emails in real-time.\nBuilt with n8n, Google Gemini, Notion, and Google Sheets, it’s perfect for founders, freelancers, and agencies who receive a ton of emails daily and want to automate the triage process without losing control.\n\n##### How It Works\n\n1. Gmail Trigger — Detects new incoming emails.\n\n2. Process Email Data — Extracts sender info, subject, and content in a clean structured format.\n\n3. AI Email Analyzer — Uses Gemini AI to summarize the email and decide the most relevant label (e.g., Project Updates, Client Requests, Invoices, etc.).\n\n4. Create Gmail Label (if not exists) — Dynamically creates a new label if the AI recommends one that doesn’t exist.\n\n5. AI Agent + Add Label to Email — Applies the correct Gmail label automatically using the message ID.\n\n6. Logs in Notion & Google Sheets — Every processed email (summary, sender, date, label) is logged for tracking and analytics.\n\n\nWho It’s For\n\n- Entrepreneurs & Founders — Manage investor, client, and product update emails automatically.\n- Agencies & Teams — Classify and track client emails effortlessly across projects.\n- Freelancers & Consultants — Get AI summaries and organize leads without manually labeling emails.\n- Tech Builders — Anyone building AI automation tools and SaaS products around inbox management.\n",
