Hello automation enthusiasts! 👋

Want to automatically track your expenses from receipts without hefty OCR service costs? I've got you covered!

I've updated my Personal Finance Tracking Chatbot template to incorporate a **free OCR service (OCR.space)**. This powerful n8n workflow lets you effortlessly log your expenses by **sending a picture of your receipt to your Telegram bot**. The OCR will extract key details like amount, date, and description, which are then neatly saved into your **Google Sheets**!

**Why use this template?**
- 📸 Free OCR-Powered Expense Tracking: Simply send a photo of your receipt to your Telegram bot and let OCR.space do the heavy lifting – without breaking the bank!
- 📊 Automated Google Sheets Entry: Extracted data is seamlessly appended to your Google Sheet for easy financial overview.
- 💰 Manual Entry Still Available: Easily record incomes and expenses via text commands for transactions without receipts.
- 🤖 Instant Telegram Confirmations: Get immediate feedback on successful recordings, whether manual or OCR-processed.
- ✨ Customizable Parsing: The included Function node allows you to refine the data extraction logic to perfectly match your receipt formats.

**What Do You Need?**
- An n8n account (self-hosted or cloud)
- Your own Telegram Bot (free and easy to create!)
- A **free API Key from OCR.space**.
- A Google account and an empty Google Spreadsheet for your financial data.
- A Google Spreadsheet with "Income" and "Expenses" sheets (with columns like ***Date, Description, Amount, Category, Type, Source***).

**Who Is This For?**
This template is perfect for anyone who wants to gain more control over their personal finances in an efficient and hassle-free way. No more complex apps, just use your personal chatbot!

**How to Use It?**
1. **Get Your Free OCR.space API Key**: Visit [ocr.space/OCRAPI](https://ocr.space/OCRAPI) and sign up for a free key.
2. **Import this JSON template** into your n8n instance.
3. **Configure Credentials**: Set your Telegram Bot Token, Google Sheet ID, and OCR.space API Key as environment variables in n8n.
4. **Activate the workflow.**
5. Start tracking your finances by sending text commands (e.g., income salary 5000, expense coffee 15 food) or just snapping a photo of your receipt to your Telegram bot!
