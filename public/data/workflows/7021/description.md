## ✨ Summary 
Efficiently monitor Kubernetes environments by sending only unique error logs from Grafana Loki to Slack. Reduces alert fatigue while keeping your team informed about critical log events.

## 🧑‍💻 Who’s it for
- DevOps or SRE engineers running EKS/GKE/AKS
- Anyone using Grafana Loki and Promtail for centralized logging
- Teams that want Slack alerts but hate alert spam

## 🔍 What it does
This n8n workflow queries your Loki logs every 5 minutes, filters only the critical ones (error, timeout, exception, etc.), removes duplicate alerts within the batch, and sends clean alerts to a Slack channel with full metadata (pod, namespace, node, container, log, timestamp).

## 🧠 How it works
#### 🕒 Schedule Trigger
Every 5 minutes (customizable)

#### 🌐 Loki HTTP Query
Pulls logs from the last 10 minutes
Keyword match: error, failed, oom, etc.

#### 🧹 Log Parsing
Extracts log fields (pod, container, etc.)
Skips empty/malformed results

#### 🧠 Deduplication
Removes repeated error messages (within query window)

#### 📤 Slack Notification
Sends nicely formatted message to Slack

## ⚙️ Requirements
#### Tool	      Notes
Loki-	   Exposed internally or externally
Slack App- With chat:write OAuth 
n8n-	   Cloud or self-hosted

## 🔧 How to Set It Up
Import the JSON file into n8n

Update:

- Loki API URL (e.g., http://loki-gateway.monitoring.svc.cluster.local)
- Slack Bearer Token (via credentials)
- Target Slack channel (e.g., #k8s-alerts)
- (Optional) Change keywords in the query regex
- Activate the workflow
- Ensure n8n pod/container is having access to your kubernetes cluster/pods/namespaces

## 🛠 How to Customize
- Want more or fewer keywords? Adjust the regex in the Query Loki for Error Logs node.
- Need to increase deduplication logic? Enhance the Remove Duplicate Alerts node.
- Want 5-log summaries every 5 min? Fork this and add a Batch + Slack group sender.
