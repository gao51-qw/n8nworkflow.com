  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow automates the entire lifecycle of a service-based client, combining four distinct business flows into a single view:\n\n1. **Intake Leads:** Receives a webhook from your form builder, validates the data, optionally enriches the email using Clearbit, and creates records in Airtable and Notion.\n2. **Manage Bookings:** Processes scheduling webhooks to update lead status, create Google Calendar events, and send pre-call survey emails.\n3. **Send Reminders:** Runs a daily schedule to scan Airtable for upcoming calls and automatically sends 24h reminder emails to reduce no-shows.\n4. **Onboard Clients:** Reacts to successful payments by marking leads as \"Paid,\" generating a Notion Onboarding Checklist, and sending a Welcome Kit via Email and WhatsApp.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. **Configure Credentials:**\n   * Connect your accounts for **Airtable, Notion, Slack, Google Calendar, and GMAIL**.\n   * (Optional) Add credentials for **Clearbit** (enrichment) and **Twilio** (WhatsApp).\n\n2. **Customize Emails:**\n   * Open the four **Email Send** nodes.\n   * Customize the `Body Text` with your own booking links and survey URLs.\n\n3. **Configure Tables & IDs:**\n   * Update the **Airtable** nodes with your specific Base and Table names (e.g., `tblLeads`).\n   * Update the **Notion** nodes with your Database IDs for Projects and Onboarding.\n\n4. **Connect Webhooks:**\n   * Copy the Production URLs from the three Webhook nodes (`Lead Intake`, `Booking`, `Payment`) and paste them into your respective form, calendar, or payment provider settings.",
