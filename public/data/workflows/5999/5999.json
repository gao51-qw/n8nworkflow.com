    "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template is a hands-on tutorial for one of n8n's most powerful data tools: the **Compare Datasets** node. It's the perfect next step after learning basic logic, showing you how to build robust data synchronization workflows.\n\nWe use a simple **Warehouse Audit** analogy to make the concept crystal clear:\n*   **Warehouse A:** Our main, \"source of truth\" database. This is the master list of what our inventory *should* be.\n*   **Warehouse B:** A second, remote database (like a Notion page or Google Sheet) that we need to keep in sync.\n*   **The Compare Datasets Node:** This is our **Auditor**. It takes both inventory lists and meticulously compares them to find any discrepancies.\n\nThe Auditor then sorts every item into one of four categories, which correspond to the node's four outputs:\n1.  **In A only:** New products found in our main warehouse that need to be **added** to Warehouse B.\n2.  **Same:** Products that match perfectly in both warehouses. **No action needed!**\n3.  **Different:** Products that exist in both places but have different details (e.g., stock count). These need to be **updated** in Warehouse B.\n4.  **In B only:** Extra products found in Warehouse B that aren't in our master list. These need to be **deleted**.\n\nThis pattern is the foundation for any two-way data sync you'll ever need to build.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: 0 minutes!**\n\nThis workflow is a self-contained tutorial and requires no setup or credentials.\n\n1.  Click **\"Execute Workflow\"** to start the audit.\n2.  Explore the two `Set` nodes (\"Warehouse A\" and \"Warehouse B\") to see the initial data we are comparing.\n3.  Click on **\"The Auditor\" (Compare Datasets node)** to see how it's configured to use `product_id` as the matching key.\n4.  Follow the outputs to the four `NoOp` nodes to see which products were sorted into each category.\n5.  Read the sticky notes next to each output—they explain exactly why each item ended up there.",

This means Warehouse A's data is always correct.\n\n\n**The Four Outputs:**\nThe Auditor produces a report with four categories, which correspond to the four outputs of this node."

This workflow will teach you how to use one of the most powerful nodes for data synchronization: **Compare Datasets**.\n\n**The Analogy: Auditing Two Warehouses**\n- **Warehouse A:** Our main, \"source of truth\" warehouse. This is the master list of what we *should* have.\n- **Warehouse B:** A second, remote warehouse. We need to make sure its inventory matches Warehouse A.\n- **The Compare Datasets Node:** This is the **Auditor** with a clipboard, checking both lists to find differences.\n\n\n**How to use this tutorial:**\n1.  Click **\"Execute Workflow\"**.\n2.  Click on each of the four output nodes (`NoOp` nodes) to see which items ended up where.\n3.
