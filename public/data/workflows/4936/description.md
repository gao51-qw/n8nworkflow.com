🚀 Overview

This n8n automation workflow streamlines the creation of professional video ad scripts tailored for Veo 3 by turning basic user inputs into cinematic, consistent, and highly structured prompts.

Whether you're a marketing agency, content creator, or small business, this workflow ensures high-quality AI video generation at scale—without needing a professional copywriter or creative director.

🛠️ How It Works

1. 📝 Form Trigger
Captures initial inputs via a web form:

Ad Category: Dropdown (Before & After, Brand Awareness, UGC Style, Educational)
Environment: Text (short description of setting/location)
Script: Raw ad copy
Spokesperson: Basic character idea (e.g., “young woman, confident, skincare expert”)
2. 🧠 Build Persona Node
Uses GPT-4o-Mini to expand spokesperson input into a full character description.
Output includes:
Age
Race
Clothing
Hairstyle
Tone/Demeanor
Ensures visual consistency in AI-generated video scenes.
3. 🌆 Build Environment Node
Transforms environment text into a detailed, cinematic setting.
Adds descriptive elements like:
Lighting style
Architecture or background
Atmosphere (e.g., soft morning glow, modern interiors)
4. ✂️ Generate Copy Node
Breaks the full script into 10-second readable segments for smooth pacing.
Helps tools like Veo 3 maintain flow, coherence, and readability.
Outputs concise, camera-ready lines for each section.
5. 📄 Google Docs Integration
Auto-updates a ready-to-use script template in Google Docs.
Replaces placeholders with content from the 3 AI nodes:
Cinematic shot: (Build Persona) in (Build Environment).  
They confidently address the camera: (Generate Copy).  
Professional lighting emphasizes credibility throughout.
Final result: a polished video ad prompt, ready for Veo 3 or any AI video tool.
💸 Cost Efficiency Advantage

Using the Veo 3 API directly costs $0.50 per second — meaning a simple 5-second video costs $3.75, and a 6-clip project could run up to $24.

However, this workflow is optimized for Veo 3's Fast on Flow mode, which costs just $0.20 per clip.

🔍 Real Example:
6 clips = $1.20
Savings = Over 90%
More room for testing, iteration, and scaling
This isn’t just smart automation — it’s financially strategic.
