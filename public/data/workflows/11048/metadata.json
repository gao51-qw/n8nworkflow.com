I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) — Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).\n\n&gt; Let us use n8n to help small companies digitalise their logistics and supply chain!\n\nThis workflow helps warehouse operators generate a complete damage report without needing to write anything manually.\n\n[![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-44.png)](https://youtu.be/3Xdo1pzd8rw)\n\nIn warehouse operations, damaged pallets must be reported quickly and consistently. \n \nYou can automate the entire process using **AI to analyse photos of the damages**.\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Example of damage report\n\nThe process starts with instructions sent with the operator: \n\n[![Telegram Instructions](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-28.png)](https://youtu.be/3Xdo1pzd8rw)\n\nA photo of the damaged pallets is shared with the bot:\n\n![Damaged Pallet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-30.png)\n\nA complete report is generated and sent by email:\n\n[![Email Screenshot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-27.png)](https://youtu.be/3Xdo1pzd8rw)\n\n### 🎥 Tutorial\n\nA complete tutorial (with explanations of every node) is available on YouTube:\n\n[![Tutorial + Demo](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/temp-14.png)](https://youtu.be/3Xdo1pzd8rw)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis template is ideal for companies with limited IT ressources:\n\n- **Warehouse operators** who need a fast reporting tool  \n- **Quality teams** who want consistent and structured reports  \n- **3PLs and logistics providers** looking to digitalise damage claims  \n- **Manufacturers and retailers** with high inbound pallet volumes  \n- **Anyone using Telegram** on the warehouse floor for quick interactions\n\n### What does this workflow do?\n\nThis workflow acts as an **AI-powered damaged goods reporting assistant** using Telegram, OpenAI Vision and Gmail.\n\n1. A operator sends a picture of the damaged pallet via **Telegram**.  \n2. The workflow downloads the image and sends it to **GPT-4o** for damage analysis.  \n3. The bot replies and asks for a **photo of the pallet barcode**.  \n4. The barcode picture is processed by **GPT-4o Mini** to extract the pallet number.  \n5. The workflow combines both results (damage analysis + pallet ID).  \n6. It generates an **HTML email report** with: damage summary, observed issues, severity level and recommended actions   \n7. The report is automatically sent via **Gmail** to the configured recipient.  \n8. The operator receives a confirmation message in Telegram.\n\nThe processes does not require any data input form the operator, only to take pictures!\n\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBefore running the workflow, follow the sticky notes and configure:\n\n- Connect your **Telegram Bot API**  \n- Add your **OpenAI API Key** in the AI nodes  \n- Connect your **Gmail** credentials  \n- Update the **recipient email** in the “Send Report by Email” node  \n\n*Submitted: 20 November 2025*  \n*Template designed with n8n version 1.116.2*\n",
