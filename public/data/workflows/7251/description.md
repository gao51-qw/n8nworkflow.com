# Scanning Email Inbox for Delivery Errors

**Prerequisite:** [Automate Personalized Email Campaigns with Google Docs, Sheets, and SMTP](https://n8n.io/workflows/7065-automate-personalized-email-campaigns-with-google-docs-sheets-and-smtp/).

## How It Works

After running your email campaign, some messages may fail to deliver. This workflow scans your email inbox for delivery errors (e.g., bounced messages), flags problematic email addresses in the Google Sheet and ensures future campaigns skip them.

## How to Use

1. **Ensure Prerequisite Workflow:**  
   - You should have the [Email Campaign Workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/7065-automate-personalized-email-campaigns-with-google-docs-sheets-and-smtp/) configured and running.

2. **Google Sheet Setup:**  
   - Use the [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFKp3wmbV9qp2tpGGsN72zdiC32y8H1nhjdgP885y-U/edit?usp=sharing).  
   - Identify your document’s ID (the string after `/d/` and before `/edit` in the URL).

3. **Configure Workflow:**  
   - Enter your Google Sheet ID in the `settings` node.  
   - Connect your Google credentials to n8n.

4. **Email Inbox:**  
   - Set up the `readspamfolder` node to search for bounce/error messages in your mail (e.g., in the Spam or Inbox folders—adjust label/folder if emails land elsewhere).  

5. **Google Sheet Update:**  
   - Configure the `lookupemail` and `update_err` nodes


## Requirements

- **Google Credentials** to access Gmail and sheets.
- **Gmail Account** (bounce/error messages must be accessible here).
- **n8n Version:** Tested with 1.105.2 (Ubuntu).
