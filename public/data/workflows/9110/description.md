### **Streamline Your Zoom Meetings with Secure, Automated Stripe Payments**

This comprehensive workflow automates the entire process of setting up a paid online event, from scheduling a Zoom meeting and creating a Stripe payment link to tracking participants and sending confirmation emails.

#### **How it Works**

This workflow has two primary, distinct branches: Event Creation and Participant Registration.

**Event Creation Flow (Triggered via Form):**
- An administrator submits details (title, price, date/time) via a form.
- The workflow creates a new Zoom meeting with a unique password.
- It creates a Stripe Product and a Payment Link.
- A dedicated Google Sheet tab is created for tracking participants.
- An email is sent to the event organizer with all the details, including the Zoom link, payment link, and participant list URL.

**Participant Registration Flow (Triggered via Stripe Webhook):**
- A webhook is triggered when a Stripe payment is completed (checkout.session.completed).
- The participant's details are added to the dedicated Google Sheet tab.
- A confirmation email is sent to the participant with the Zoom link and password.
- A notification email is sent to the event organizer about the new registration.

#### **Use Cases**

#### **Customization Tips**

- **Email Content**: You are encouraged to adapt the email contents in the Gmail nodes to fit your branding and tone.

- **Currency**: Change the currency in the Config node.

- **Zoom Password**: The password is set to a random 4-character string; you can modify the logic in the Create Zoom meeting node.

- **Creation Form**: "Your journey to easy event management starts here. Click this node, copy the production URL, and keep it handy. It's your personal admin tool for quickly creating new meetings."

- **Customize**: "Feel free to adapt email contents to your needs."

#### **Testing Tips**

- **Test Creation**: Run the Creation Form to trigger the Part A flow. Verify that a Zoom meeting and Stripe Payment Link are created, a new Google Sheet tab appears, and the host receives the setup email.

- **Test Registration**: Simulate a successful payment to the generated Stripe link to trigger the Part B flow. Verify that the participant is added to the Google Sheet, receives the confirmation email with Zoom details, and the host receives the notification.
