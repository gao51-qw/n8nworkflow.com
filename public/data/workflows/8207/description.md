## Customization Guidance

- 🔄 **Change the schedule**: Replace the Trigger node with a Schedule node (e.g., daily at 8 AM).
- 📧 **Add more email platforms**: Swap Mailchimp for ConvertKit or ActiveCampaign.
- 📲 **Use WhatsApp instead of Telegram**: Replace Telegram with WhatsAble for team alerts.
- 🎯 **Filter by tag or audience**: Add a Function node to route content based on `Content Type`.
- 🌐 **Add Instagram or LinkedIn**: Extend Buffer to post to more platforms.

This workflow grows with your launch strategy.
