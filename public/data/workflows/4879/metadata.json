  "description": "![Screenshot 20250612 120714.png](fileId:1513)\n ⚠️ This template uses only official n8n nodes. No community nodes required.\n\n## 🧑‍💼 Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for:\n- Legal tech founders\n- Marketing freelancers or consultants\n- Agencies supporting lawyers and small law firms\n- Anyone doing outbound outreach in the legal niche\n\n## ❓ What problem is this solving?\n\nLinkedIn is a goldmine for targeting legal professionals — but scraping and personalizing outreach is tedious and expensive. Most tools either:\n- Require paid LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n- Can’t personalize at scale\n- Violate LinkedIn’s TOS\n\nThis workflow solves that by using **free Google Search**, **OpenRouter AI**, and **GPT-4o** to find, enrich, and message up to **1,000 solo lawyers per day** — without using browser automation or scrapers.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\n1. Uses **Google Programmable Search** to find solo lawyers and small firm founders on LinkedIn\n2. Parses each profile’s name, title, profile URL, and snippet\n3. Saves raw lead data to Google Sheets\n4. Uses **OpenRouter Sonar Pro** to enrich each profile with external content\n5. Generates a personalized, 1-line message using **GPT-4o**\n6. Appends the final message into Google Sheets for outreach\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup\n\nEstimated time: **15–20 minutes**\n\n### ✅ Google Programmable Search\n- Enable the Custom Search API on Google Cloud\n- Create a programmable search engine set to search the full web\n- Copy your `API key` and `CX ID`\n\n### ✅ Google Sheets\n- Create a sheet with columns: `Name`, `Title`, `Profile URL`, `Outreach Message`\n- Share the sheet with your OAuth-connected Google account\n\n### ✅ OpenRouter\n- Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)\n- Fund with at least $5 and generate your API key\n- Use the model `perplexity/sonar-pro` for real-time research\n\n### ✅ GPT-4o (optional)\n- You can use your OpenAI key or route GPT-4o via OpenRouter\n\nAll setup-specific values are marked clearly in sticky notes and placeholders.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Change the Google search query to match your industry (e.g., `\"founder\" AND \"therapist\" site:linkedin.com/in`)\n- Modify the AI prompt to match your tone (formal, casual, humorous)\n- Connect the final output to your CRM (like HubSpot, Airtable, etc.)\n- Add a second outreach message variant to A/B test performance\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Sticky Notes & Annotations\n\n- All nodes are clearly renamed for understandability (e.g., `Find Lawyer Profiles`, `Parse LinkedIn Search Results`)\n- Color-coded sticky notes explain:\n  - Setup instructions\n  - Required credentials\n  - Use case![Screenshot 20250612 113505.png](fileId:1511)\n\n---\n\n## 🗂 Category\n\n- AI\n- Sales\n- Marketing\n",
