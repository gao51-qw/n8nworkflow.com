  "description": "![Transfer Stripe customers and checkout data to KlickTipp with conditional tagging.png](fileId:2984)\nCommunity Node Disclaimer: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n### How It Works\nThis workflow listens for new or updated customers and for checkout confirmations in **Stripe** and automatically creates or updates contacts in KlickTipp, enriching profiles for segmentation and automated messaging. Tags are applied dynamically: high-value orders (≥100) get a Premium Customer tag, and purchases with certain SKUs (e.g., clothing) receive product-based tags. The process keeps your database clean, accurate, and updated in real time for targeted campaigns. Perfect for digital product sellers, course creators, and service providers seeking an end-to-end automated sales confirmation process.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n1. **KlickTipp Preparation**\n      - Prepare **custom fields**\n       - `Products` (Text)\n       - `Total` (Decimal Number)\n       - `Payment ID` (Text)\n       - `Receipt URL` (URL)\n      - Prepare **tags**:\n       - `Premium customer`\n       - `Clothing buyer`\n\n2. **Credential Configuration**\n     - Connect your Stripe account using an API key from the Stripe Dashboard.\n     - Authenticate your KlickTipp connection with username/password credentials (API access required).\n\n### Customization\n- Launch upsell or membership campaigns using tags.  \n- Use KlickTipp placeholders (`[[Stripe | Products]]`, `[[Stripe | Total]]`, etc.) for dynamic emails.  \n- Route buyers to portals (e.g., Memberspot, Mentortools).  \n- Trigger CRM, Slack notification, or invoice creation.  \n",
