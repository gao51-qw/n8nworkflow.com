  "description": "## **Using PostBin to Test Webhooks Without Changing WEBHOOK_URL**  \n\n### **How it Works**  \nMany new n8n users struggle with testing webhooks when running n8n on localhost, as external services cannot reach `localhost`. This workflow introduces a technique using PostBin, which provides a temporary, publicly accessible URL to receive webhook requests.  \n\n1. Generates a temporary webhook endpoint via PostBin.  \n2. Uses this endpoint in place of `localhost` to test webhooks.  \n3. Captures and displays the incoming webhook request data.  \n4. Enables debugging and iterating without modifying the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n- **Estimated time:** ~5–10 minutes  \n1. **Create a PostBin instance** to generate a publicly accessible webhook URL.  \n2. **Copy the PostBin URL** and use it as the webhook destination in n8n.  \n3. **Trigger the webhook** from an external service or manually.  \n4. **Inspect the request payload** in PostBin to verify data reception.  \n\n---  \n\n## **(EXAMPLE) Using PostBin for Webhook Testing in a BambooHR Integration**  \n\n### **How it Works**  \nIn this example, we apply the PostBin technique to a BambooHR integration. Instead of manually configuring a webhook in BambooHR, this workflow automates webhook registration using the BambooHR API. The workflow:  \n\n1. Uses the BambooHR API to programmatically register the PostBin URL as a webhook.  \n2. Retrieves the most recent webhook calls made by BambooHR to the PostBin URL.  \n3. (Optional) Sends a personalized Slack message for new employees using OpenAI.  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n- **Estimated time:** ~15–20 minutes  \n1. **Set up PostBin** using the steps from the first section.  \n2. **Log into BambooHR** to generate an API key for authentication.  \n3. **Run the workflow** to register the PostBin URL as a webhook in BambooHR via the API.\n4. **Retrieve recent webhook calls** from PostBin to validate data reception.  \n5. (Optional) **Send a Slack notification** using the processed data.",
