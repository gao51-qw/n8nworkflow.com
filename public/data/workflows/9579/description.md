## 👤 Who’s it for

This workflow is designed for employees who need to submit expense claims for business trips. It automates the process of extracting data from receipts/invoices, logging it to a Google Sheet, and notifying the finance team via email.

Ideal users:
- Employees submitting business trip expense claims
- HR or Admins reviewing travel-related reimbursements
- Finance teams responsible for processing claims

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. **Employee submits a form** with trip information (name, department, purpose, dates) and uploads one or more receipts/invoices (PDF).
2. **Uploaded files are saved to Google Drive** for record-keeping.
3. Each PDF is passed to a **DocClaim Assistant agent**, which uses GPT-4o and a structured parser to extract structured invoice data.
4. The data is **transformed and formatted** into a standard JSON structure.
5. Two parallel paths are followed:
   - Invoice records are appended to a **Google Sheet** for centralized tracking.
   - A detailed **HTML email** summarizing the trip and expenses is generated and sent to the **finance department** for claim processing.

## 🛠 How to set up

1. **Create a form** to capture:
   - Employee Name
   - Department
   - Trip Purpose
   - From Date / To Date
   - Receipt/Invoice File Upload (multiple PDFs)

2. **Configure file upload node** to store files in a specific Google Drive folder.

3. **Set up DocClaim Agent** using:
   - GPT-4o or any LLM with document analysis capability
   - Output parser for standardizing extracted receipt data (e.g., vendor, total, tax, date)

4. **Transform extracted data** into a structured claim record (Code Node).

5. **Path 1**: Save records to a Google Sheet (one row per expense).

6. **Path 2**:
   - Format the employee + claim data into a dynamic **HTML email**
   - Use `Send Email` node to notify the finance department (e.g., `finance@yourcompany.com`)

## ✅ Requirements

- Jotform account with expense form setup [Sign up for free here](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=mediajade)
- n8n running with access to:
  - Google Drive API (for file uploads)
  - Google Sheets API (for logging expenses)
  - Email node (SMTP or Gmail for sending)
- GPT-4o or equivalent LLM with document parsing ability
- PDF invoices with clear formatting
- Shared Google Sheet for claim tracking
- Optional: Shared inbox for finance team



## 🧩 How to customize the workflow

- **Add approval steps**: route the email to a manager before finance
- **Attach original PDFs**: include uploaded files in the email as attachments
- **Localize for other languages**: adapt form labels, email content, or parser prompts
- **Sync to ERP or accounting system**: replace Google Sheet with QuickBooks, Xero, etc.
- **Set limits/validation**: enforce max claim per trip or required fields before submission
- **Auto-tag expenses**: add categories (e.g., travel, accommodation) for better reporting
