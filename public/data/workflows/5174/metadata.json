  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow demonstrates a fundamental pattern for securing a webhook by requiring an API key. It acts as a gatekeeper, checking for a valid key in the request header before allowing the request to proceed.\n\n1.  **Incoming Request:** The `Secured Webhook` node receives an incoming `POST` request. It expects an API key to be sent in the `x-api-key` header.\n2.  **API Key Verification:**\n    *   The `Check API Key` node takes the key from the incoming request's header.\n    *   It then makes an internal HTTP request to a *second* webhook (`Get API Key`) which acts as a mock database.\n    *   This second webhook retrieves a list of registered API keys (from the `Registered API Keys` node) and filters it to find a match for the key that was provided.\n3.  **Conditional Response:**\n    *   **If a match is found**, the `API Key Identified` node routes the execution to the \"success\" path, returning a `200 OK` response with the identified user's ID.\n    *   **If no match is found**, it routes to the \"unauthorized\" path, returning a `401 Unauthorized` error.\n\nThis pattern separates the public-facing endpoint from the data source, which is a good security practice.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~2 minutes**\n\nThis workflow is designed to be a self-contained example.\n\n1.  **Set up Credentials:** This workflow uses \"Header Auth\" for its internal communication. Go to **Credentials** and create a new **Header Auth** credential. You can use any name and value (e.g., Name: `X-N8N-Auth`, Value: `my-secret-password`). Select this credential in all four webhook/HTTP Request nodes.\n2.  **Add Your API Keys:** Open the **`Registered API Keys`** node. This is your mock database. Edit the array to include the `user_id` and `api_key` pairs you want to authorize.\n3.  **Activate the workflow.**\n4.  **Test it:** Use the **`Test Secure Webhook`** node to send a request.\n    *   Try it with a valid key from your list to see the success response.\n    *   Change the `x-api-key` header to an invalid key to see the `401 Unauthorized` error.\n\n**For Production:** Replace the mock database part of this workflow (the `Get API Key` webhook and `Registered API Keys` node) with a real database node like Supabase, Postgres, or Baserow to look up keys.",
