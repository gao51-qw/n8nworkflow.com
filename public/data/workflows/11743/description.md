This workflow converts raw ClickUp task updates—received directly through a webhook—into fully automated release documentation. It validates incoming payloads, fetches and cleans task details, enriches them with AI-generated metadata, produces structured release notes using GPT-4o, publishes them to Notion, notifies stakeholders on Slack, emails a formatted summary, and logs the release into Google Sheets.
The system handles malformed events gracefully by logging invalid payloads and continues only when a valid task_id is present. It extracts structured fields (title, description, links, priority, assignee), then augments them with AI-driven classifications such as risk level, change type, module, and impact score. GPT-4o generates polished release notes following a strict template. Finally, the workflow distributes the release across multiple channels while maintaining an auditable, centralized history.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)

🟢 Webhook — Receive ClickUp Task Update
 Captures incoming events from ClickUp via POST and forwards the raw body for parsing.

🧹 Code in JavaScript — Extract task_id
 Parses the raw webhook body and safely extracts task_id.
 Invalid JSON → forwarded to error logging.

🔍 Validate Incoming ClickUp Task Event
 Checks if task_id exists.
 Valid → continue workflow
 Invalid → log error to Google Sheets

📄 Fetch Full Task Details from ClickUp
 Retrieves full task metadata: title, description, status, priority, links, assignee details, and due date.

🧩 Extract Clean Task Fields from ClickUp Data
 Normalizes and structures the task fields into a clean, usable JSON object.

🧠 Provide GPT-4o Model for Metadata Extraction
 Loads the language model for metadata generation.

🔍 Generate Release Metadata via AI
 AI generates structured metadata including:
 • risk_level
 • change_type
 • module
 • impact_score
 • requires_testing

🧹 Parse AI Metadata JSON Output
 Parses stringified JSON from the AI node into valid structured JSON.
 Malformed metadata → returned as an error object.

🔀 Merge Task Details with Metadata
 Combines clean task fields with AI-generated metadata into a complete release-ready object.

🧠 Provide GPT-4o Model for Release Notes
 Supplies the language model needed to generate formal release notes.

✍️ Generate Structured Release Notes via AI
 Produces uniform release notes containing:
 • Summary
