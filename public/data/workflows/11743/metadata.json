  "description": "This workflow converts raw ClickUp task updates—received directly through a webhook—into fully automated release documentation. It validates incoming payloads, fetches and cleans task details, enriches them with AI-generated metadata, produces structured release notes using GPT-4o, publishes them to Notion, notifies stakeholders on Slack, emails a formatted summary, and logs the release into Google Sheets.\nThe system handles malformed events gracefully by logging invalid payloads and continues only when a valid task_id is present. It extracts structured fields (title, description, links, priority, assignee), then augments them with AI-driven classifications such as risk level, change type, module, and impact score. GPT-4o generates polished release notes following a strict template. Finally, the workflow distributes the release across multiple channels while maintaining an auditable, centralized history.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n🟢 Webhook — Receive ClickUp Task Update\n Captures incoming events from ClickUp via POST and forwards the raw body for parsing.\n\n🧹 Code in JavaScript — Extract task_id\n Parses the raw webhook body and safely extracts task_id.\n Invalid JSON → forwarded to error logging.\n\n🔍 Validate Incoming ClickUp Task Event\n Checks if task_id exists.\n Valid → continue workflow\n Invalid → log error to Google Sheets\n\n📄 Fetch Full Task Details from ClickUp\n Retrieves full task metadata: title, description, status, priority, links, assignee details, and due date.\n\n🧩 Extract Clean Task Fields from ClickUp Data\n Normalizes and structures the task fields into a clean, usable JSON object.\n\n🧠 Provide GPT-4o Model for Metadata Extraction\n Loads the language model for metadata generation.\n\n🔍 Generate Release Metadata via AI\n AI generates structured metadata including:\n • risk_level\n • change_type\n • module\n • impact_score\n • requires_testing\n\n🧹 Parse AI Metadata JSON Output\n Parses stringified JSON from the AI node into valid structured JSON.\n Malformed metadata → returned as an error object.\n\n🔀 Merge Task Details with Metadata\n Combines clean task fields with AI-generated metadata into a complete release-ready object.\n\n🧠 Provide GPT-4o Model for Release Notes\n Supplies the language model needed to generate formal release notes.\n\n✍️ Generate Structured Release Notes via AI\n Produces uniform release notes containing:\n • Summary\n • Improvements & Features\n • Bug Fixes\n • Impact Analysis\n • Known Issues\n\n📝 Extract Release Notes Title & Final Output\n Extracts title from markdown and prepares final content for publishing.\n\n📘 Create Release Notes Page in Notion\n Saves the release notes as a new page in the Notion Release Notes database.\n\n💬 Post Release Announcement to Slack\n Sends formatted release notes + Notion link to the specified Slack user/channel.\n\n📧 Send Release Summary Email\n Sends a structured HTML email with the release summary, full notes, and Notion link.\n\n📊 Append Release Log Entry to Google Sheet\n Writes a complete release log entry including:\n • task ID\n • title\n • priority\n • module\n • risk level\n • Notion URL\n • Slack message URL\n • release date\n\n🛑 Log Invalid ClickUp Events to Google Sheet\n Stores any invalid or incomplete webhook payload for debugging and auditing.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n • ClickUp API token\n • Public webhook endpoint in n8n\n • Azure OpenAI GPT-4o credentials\n • Notion API integration\n • Slack API token\n • Google Sheets OAuth\n • Gmail OAuth\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Converts ClickUp updates directly into finished release documentation\n ✔ AI-powered metadata ensures consistent classification\n ✔ Instant multi-channel dissemination: Slack + Email + Notion\n ✔ Automatic logging for audit, QA, and release governance\n ✔ Eliminates manual writing, formatting, and cross-platform updates\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n-  Product teams running constant sprints\n-  Engineering teams needing reliable release documentation\n-  Teams using ClickUp as their primary task manager\n-  Organizations with multi-channel release communication needs\n",
