  "description": "This workflow restores all n8n instance credentials from GitHub backups using the n8n API node. It complements the [Backup Your Credentials to GitHub](https://n8n.io/workflows/2307-backup-your-credentials-to-github/) template by allowing users to seamlessly restore previously saved credentials.\n\n## How It Works\nThe workflow fetches credentials stored in a GitHub repository and imports them into your n8n instance. \n\n## Setup Instructions\nTo configure the workflow, update the `Globals` node with the following values:\n\n- **repo.owner** – Your GitHub username\n- **repo.name** – The name of your GitHub repository storing the credentials\n- **repo.path** – The folder path within the repository where credentials are stored\n\nFor example, if your GitHub username is `john-doe`, your repository is named `n8n-backups`, and credentials are stored in a `credentials/` folder, you would set:\n\n- `repo.owner` → `john-doe`\n- `repo.name` → `n8n-backups`\n- `repo.path` → `credentials/`\n\n### Required Credentials\n- **GitHub API** – Access to your repository  \n- **n8n API** – To import credentials into your n8n instance  \n\n## Who Is This For?\nThis template is ideal for users who want to restore their credentials from GitHub backups, ensuring easy migration and recovery in case of data loss.\n\n---\n\nCheck out my other templates:  \n👉 [My n8n Templates](https://n8n.io/creators/bangank36/)\n",
