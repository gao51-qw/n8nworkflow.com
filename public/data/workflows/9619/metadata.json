  "description": "## Who’s it for\n\nTeams building health/fitness apps, coaches running check-ins in chat, and anyone who needs quick, structured nutrition insights from food photos—without manual logging.\n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nThis workflow accepts a food image (URL or Base64), uses a vision-capable LLM to infer likely ingredients and rough gram amounts, estimates per-ingredient calories, and returns a strict JSON summary with total calories and a short nutrition note. It normalizes different payloads (e.g., Telegram/LINE/Webhook) into a common format, handles transient errors with retries, and avoids hardcoded secrets by using credentials/env vars.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Vision-capable LLM credentials (e.g., `gpt-4o` or equivalent)\n* One input channel (Webhook, Telegram, or LINE)\n* Environment variables for model name/temperature and optional request validation\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect your input channel and enable the Webhook (copy the test URL).\n2. Add LLM credentials and set `LLM_MODEL` and `LLM_TEMPERATURE` (e.g., `0.3`).\n3. Turn on the workflow, send a sample payload with `imageUrl`, and confirm the strict JSON output.\n4. (Optional) Configure a reply node (Telegram/Slack or HTTP Response) and a logger (Google Sheets/Notion).\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n* **Outputs**: Add macros (protein/fat/carb) or micronutrient fields.\n* **Units**: Convert portion descriptions (piece/slice) to grams with your own mapping.\n* **Languages**: Toggle multilingual output (ja/en).\n* **Policies**: Tighten validation (reject low-confidence parses) or add manual review steps.\n* **Security**: Use signed/temporary URLs for private images; mask PII in logs.\n\n## Data model (strict JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dishName\": \"string\",\n  \"ingredients\": [{ \"name\": \"string\", \"amount\": 0, \"calories\": 0 }],\n  \"totalCalories\": 0,\n  \"nutritionEvaluation\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nRename all nodes clearly, include sticky notes explaining the setup, and never commit real IDs, tokens, or API keys.\n",
