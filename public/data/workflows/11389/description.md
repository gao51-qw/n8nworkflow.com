## How it works  
This workflow takes a list of links from Google Sheets, visits each page, extracts the main text using [Decodo](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD), and creates a summary with the help of artificial intelligence.  
It helps you turn research articles or web pages into clear, structured insights you can reuse for your projects, content ideas, or newsletters.

**Input:** A Google Sheet named `input` with one column called `url`.  
**Output:** Another Google Sheet named `output`, where all the processed data is stored:  
- **URL:** original article link  
- **Title:** article title  
- **Source:** website or domain  
- **Published Date:** publication date (if found)  
- **Main Topic:** main theme of the article  
- **Key Ideas:** three main takeaways or insights  
- **Summary:** short text summary  
- **Text Type:** type of content (e.g., article, blog, research paper)

## Setup steps  
1. Connect your Google Sheets account.  
2. Add your links to the `input` sheet.  
3. In the **[Decodo](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD)** node, insert your API key.  
4. Configure the AI model (for example, Gemini).  
5. Run the workflow and check the results in the `output` sheet.
