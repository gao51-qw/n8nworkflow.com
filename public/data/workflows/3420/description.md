### What is a CSRD XHTML Report?  
Under the **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)**, companies must publish their ESG disclosures in a **machine-readable XHTML format**, embedding **XBRL tags** that make the report structured and standardized.  

[![What is XHTML](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/04/temp.png)](https://youtu.be/npeJZv5U7og)

These files must follow strict formatting and tagging rules to ensure **compliance**, **traceability**, and **accessibility** for both regulators and analysts.


### Who is this template for?  
This workflow is designed for **sustainability teams, ESG consultants**, or **developers** who want to **automatically check the structure and format** of CSRD reports submitted in XHTML.


### How does it work?  
This N8N workflow automates the audit process:  
1. **📤 Input Node** → Uploads or fetches the XHTML file via URL or Webhook.  
2. **🧪 Validates Structure** → Uses a custom code node to parse HTML and identify required tags (e.g., `&lt;ix:nonNumeric&gt;`, namespaces).  
3. **📋 Outputs a Report** → Returns a summary report of errors, warnings, and key metadata (like entity name, reporting period).  
4. **📤 Export Option** → Save the results in Google Sheets or send via email.

### Prerequisite  
- A sample XHTML file that you can find in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/samirsaci/n8n-templates)
- **Google Sheets API** and **OpenAI API** credentials

### Next Steps  
Follow the **sticky notes** inside each node to adjust parsing rules or extend validation to specific XBRL tags relevant to your sector (e.g., GHG emissions, water usage).

### Notes  
- This workflow includes an example XHTML file to test the validator.  
- You can plug this into your internal systems or even extend it with AI to **auto-summarize the sustainability report**.
