  "description": "## Parse, Normalize, Extract, and Store PDF Content for RAG in Pinecone\n\nThis workflow automates a full RAG pipeline for structured documents (like insurance policies).  \n\n### What it does\n- Watches a Google Drive folder for new PDFs  \n- Uploads to LlamaIndex Cloud for parsing → returns clean Markdown  \n- Normalizes text (removes headers, footers, page numbers, formatting artifacts)  \n- Splits text into chunks (~1200 chars with 150 overlap)  \n- Generates embeddings with OpenAI  \n- Stores vectors in Pinecone with metadata  \n- Connects a Chat Agent that retrieves answers from Pinecone  \n\n### Who’s it for\n- Developers building **chatbots or Q&A systems** for structured docs  \n- Teams working with **insurance, compliance, or legal PDFs**  \n- Anyone who needs to **normalize & store documents for semantic search**  \n\n### Requirements\n- Google Drive connected (for source PDFs)  \n- LlamaIndex Cloud account (parsing API key)  \n- Pinecone account (vector DB)  \n- OpenAI account (LLM and embeddings) \n\n### How to use and customize\n* Update the folder name in google drive trigger node. \n* Place a pdf file in the same folder in google drive.  \n* Customize the `Normalized Content` function node to adjust regex for headers/footers specific to your documents.  \n* Adjust chunk size or metadata namespace in the Pinecone node to fit your project needs.  \n\n---\n",
