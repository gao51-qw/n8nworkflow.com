  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n**How it works**\n• Publishes content to 9 social platforms (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter/X, Bluesky, Pinterest) from a single Airtable base\n• Automatically uploads media to Blotato, handles platform-specific requirements (YouTube titles, Pinterest boards), and tracks success/failure for each post\n• Includes smart features like GPT-powered YouTube title optimization, Pinterest Board ID finder tool, and random delays to avoid rate limits\n\n**Set up steps**  \n• Takes ~20–35 minutes to configure all 9 platforms (or less if you only need specific ones)\n• Requires Airtable personal access token, Blotato API key, and connecting your social accounts in Blotato dashboard\n• Workflow includes comprehensive sticky notes with step-by-step Airtable base setup, credential configuration, platform ID locations, and quick debugging links for each social network\n\n**Pro tip**: The workflow is modular - you can disable any platforms you don't use by deactivating their respective nodes, making it flexible for any social media strategy from single-platform to full omnichannel publishing.",
