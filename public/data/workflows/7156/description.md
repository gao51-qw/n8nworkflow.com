A hands-on starter workflow that teaches beginners how to:

Pull rows from a Google Sheet

Append a new record that mimics a form submission

Generate AI-powered text with GPT-4o based on a “Topic” column

Write the AI output back into the correct row using an update operation

Along the way you’ll learn the three essential Google Sheets operations in n8n (read → append → update), see how to pass sheet data into an OpenAI node, and document each step with sticky-note instructions—perfect for anyone taking their first steps in no-code automation.


### 0️⃣ Prerequisites
- **Google Sheets**
  1. Open **Google Cloud Console** → create / select a project.  
  2. Enable **Google Sheets API** under *APIs & Services*.  
  3. Create an OAuth **Desktop** credential and connect it in n8n.  
  4. Share the spreadsheet with the Google account linked to the credential.
- **OpenAI**
  1. Create a secret key at &lt;https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys&gt;.  
  2. In n8n → **Credentials** → **New** → choose **OpenAI API** and paste the key.
- **Sample sheet to copy** (make your own copy and use its link)

### 1️⃣ Trigger  
**Manual Trigger** – lets you run on demand while learning.  
*(Swap for a Schedule or Webhook once you automate.)*

---

### 2️⃣ Read existing rows  
- **Node:** `Get Rows from Google Sheets`  
- Reads every row from **Sheet1** of your copied file.

---

### 3️⃣ Generate a demo row  
- **Node:** `Generate 1 Row of Data` (Set node)  
- Pretends a form was submitted:  
  - `Name`, `Email`, `Topic`, `Submitted = "Yes"`

---

### 4️⃣ Append the new row  
- **Node:** `Append Data to Google`  
- Operation **append** → writes to the first empty line.

---

### 5️⃣ Create a description with GPT-4o  
1. **`OpenAI Chat Model`** – uses your OpenAI credential.  
2. **`Write description`** (AI Agent) – prompt = the **Topic**.  
3. **`Structured Output Parser`** – forces JSON like: `{ "description": "…" }`.

---

### 6️⃣ Update that same row  
- **Node:** `Update Sheets data`  
- Operation **update**.  
- Matches on column **Email** to update the correct line.  
- Writes the new **Description** cell returned by GPT-4o.

---

### 7️⃣ Why this matters  
- Demonstrates the three core Google Sheets operations: **read → append → update**.  
- Shows how to enrich sheet data with an **AI step** and push the result right back.  
- Sticky Notes provide inline docs so anyone opening the workflow understands the flow instantly.
