  "description": "**How it works**\n- User submits a keyword through a form to trigger the workflow.\n- Ads matching the keyword are scraped from Facebook Ads Library.\n- Ads are filtered by media type (image or video).\n- Images are analyzed using an AI model to describe visuals and text.\n- Videos are downloaded, processed, and sent to Gemini for visual and spoken content analysis.\n- Text, URLs, and media descriptions are compiled.\n- All ad insights are saved into a Google Sheet for easy viewing.\n\n**Set up steps**\n- **Requires** Apify and Gemini API credentials, Google Sheets access, and OpenAI key.\n- **Import** the workflow into n8n and connect accounts to form, HTTP, and Sheets nodes.\n- Provide form trigger URL for user input; **no advanced config needed**.\n- **Estimated setup time:** ~15–20 minutes for a user familiar with n8n.\n- **Sticky notes** inside the workflow provide helpful guidance per section.",
