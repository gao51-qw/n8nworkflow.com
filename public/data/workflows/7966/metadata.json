  "description": "### This n8n workflow shows how to **extract website content, index it in Pinecone, and leverage Airtable to power a chat agent for customer Q&A**.\n\nUse cases include:  \n* Building a **knowledge base** from your website.  \n* Creating a **chatbot** that answers customer queries using your own site content.  \n* Powering **RAG workflows** for FAQs, support docs, or product knowledge.  \n\n---\n\n### How it works\n* Workflow starts with a **manual trigger** or chat message.  \n* Website content is fetched via **HTTP Request**.  \n* The **HTML body** is extracted and converted into clean **Markdown**.  \n* Text is split into chunks (~500 chars with 50 overlap) using the **Character Text Splitter**.  \n* **OpenAI embeddings** are generated for each chunk.  \n* Content and embeddings are stored in **Pinecone** with namespace separation.  \n* A **Chat Agent** (powered by OpenAI or OpenRouter) retrieves answers from Pinecone and Airtable.  \n* **Memory buffer** allows multi-turn conversations.  \n* A **billing tool** (Airtable) provides dynamic billing-related answers when needed.  \n\n---\n\n### How to use\n* Replace the sample website URL in the **HTTP Request** node with your own domain or content source. \n* Update Normalize code based on markdown content output to remove noise. \n* Adjust chunk size in the **Text Splitter** for your website markdown output.  \n  * In this example, the **Character Text Splitter with separator `######`** worked really well.  \n  * Always check the **Markdown output** to fine-tune your splitting logic.  \n* Update **Pinecone namespace** to match your project.  \n* Customize the **Chat Agent system prompt** to fit your brand voice and response rules.  \n* Connect to your own **Airtable schema** if you want live billing/payment data access.  \n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n* **OpenAI account** (for embeddings + chat model).  \n* **Pinecone account** (vector DB for semantic search).  \n* **Airtable account** (if using the billing tool).  \n* (Optional) **OpenRouter account** (alternative chat model provider).  \n* n8n self-hosted or cloud.  \n\n---\n\n### Need Help?  \nAsk in the [n8n Forum](https://community.n8n.io/)!  \n\nHappy Automating! 🚀\n",
