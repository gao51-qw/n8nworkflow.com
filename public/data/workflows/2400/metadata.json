  "description": "This workflow is an experiment to integrate charts in AI Agents, using the new [Structured Output from OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/) and [Quickchart.io](https://quickchart.io/).\n\n## How it works\n- Users chat with an AI Agent.\n- Anytime the AI Agent considers a chart is needed, it calls a tool to generate a chart\n- OpenAI generates a chart using the Quickchart definition\n- This object is added at the end of a Quickchart.io URL ([see documentation](https://quickchart.io/documentation/usage/parameters/))\n- The url is added in the conversation via the AI Agent as markdown.\n\n\n## Set up steps\n- Create an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\n- Create the OpenAI credentials\n- Use the credentials for the HTTP Request node (as Predefined Credential type)\n- Activate your workflow\n- Start chatting\n- For example, you can ask the AI Agent to generate a chart about the top 5 movies at the box office\n- Start exploring the limits\n\n**Shout-out**\n[Quickchart.io](https://quickchart.io) is an amazing open source project that provides a free API to test. Go check them out!\n\n\n**Example of chart**\n![Screenshot 20240904 at 14.08.29.png](fileId:836)",
