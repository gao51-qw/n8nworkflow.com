  "description": "## This n8n template helps in making informed decisions for Crypto and Stocks Trading by helping you keep track of breaking changes in the market.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Collects crypto and/or stock market headlines from multiple sources: CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Google News, and X (via an RSS proxy).\n- Normalizes all items into a consistent structure with fields like `source`, `kind`, `title`, `url`, `publishedAt`, `matchedKeywords`, `media[]`, and `topic`.\n- Uses topic-specific keyword lists to keep relevant items and a small spam blacklist to drop giveaways / airdrops / obvious noise.\n- Deduplicates items across runs by tracking previously seen links.\n- Bundles everything into a compact `{ topic, items[] }` JSON payload and sends it to your own backend or UI via HTTP.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n- Import the template JSON into a new n8n workflow.\n- In the **Init RunConfig** code node, choose a default `topic` (`crypto` or `stocks`), which platforms to use (CoinDesk / CoinTelegraph / Google News / X), and optionally adjust tickers and keywords.\n- Open the final **HTTP Request - Send to your backend** node and:\n  - Replace the example URL with your own API endpoint.\n  - Either set a `x-webhook-secret` header that your backend validates, or remove this header entirely if you don’t use it.\n- Create any required credentials (for the webhook header auth and for HTTP requests, if needed) – the template does **not** contain real API keys.\n- Enable either the **Schedule Trigger** for periodic runs or the **Webhook** trigger for on-demand runs from your app.\n- Expect roughly 10–20 minutes to import, configure, and test the first run; detailed per-node notes are available as sticky notes inside the workflow canvas.\n",
