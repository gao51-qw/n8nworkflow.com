  "description": "### Create a RAG System with Paul Essays, Milvus, and OpenAI for Cited Answers\n\nThis workflow automates the process of creating a document-based AI retrieval system using [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), an open-source vector database. It consists of two main steps:\n\n1. Data collection/processing\n2. Retrieval/response generation\n\nThe system scrapes [Paul Graham essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html), processes them, and loads them into a Milvus vector store. When users ask questions, it retrieves relevant information and generates responses with citations.\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection and Processing\n\n1. Set up a Milvus server using the [official guide](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md)\n2. Create a collection named \"my_collection\"\n3. Execute the workflow to scrape Paul Graham essays:\n   - Fetch essay lists\n   - Extract names\n   - Split content into manageable items\n   - Limit results (if needed)\n   - Fetch texts\n   - Extract content\n   - Load everything into Milvus Vector Store\n\nThis step uses [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for vectorization.\n\n### Step 2: Retrieval and Response Generation\n\nWhen a chat message is received, the system:\n\n* Sets chunks to send to the model\n* Retrieves relevant information from the Milvus Vector Store\n* Prepares chunks\n* Answers the query based on those chunks\n* Composes citations\n* Generates a comprehensive response\n\nThis process uses OpenAI embeddings and models to ensure accurate and relevant answers with proper citations.\n\nFor more information on vector databases and similarity search, visit [Milvus documentation](https://milvus.io/docs).\n",
