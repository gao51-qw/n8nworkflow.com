Advanced Gmail AI Auto-Responder with Context Intelligence
The next-generation email automation that knows your communication style, remembers conversations, and responds with human-like intelligence.

🚀 What Makes This Advanced?
Unlike basic AI email responders, this workflow creates contextually intelligent responses by:

📄 Reading your communication profile from Google Drive
🧠 Remembering full conversation history with vector embeddings
🎯 Understanding context from previous emails in the thread
🤖 Using AI agents instead of simple prompt-response patterns
💾 Building memory of your communication style and preferences

The Result: Responses that sound authentically like you, with perfect context awareness.
