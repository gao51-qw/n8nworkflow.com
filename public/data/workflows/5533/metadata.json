  "description": "# 🚨 Emergency Alerts Reporter to iMessage\n\nThis n8n template fetches real-time emergency incident alerts from PulsePoint for a specific agency and delivers them directly to any phone number via iMessage using the Blooio API. It's designed to keep users informed with clear, AI-summarized reports of emergency activity near them—automatically and reliably.\n\nUse cases are powerful and immediate:  \n- Get real-time fire/medical alerts for your neighborhood.  \n- Use it for family, local safety groups, or even emergency response teams.  \n- Convert technical dispatch data into readable updates with emojis and plain English.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Good to Know\n\n- You’ll need a **PulsePoint agency ID** (see instructions below).  \n- iMessages are sent using [Blooio’s API](https://blooio.com) (which supports Apple’s iMessage and fallback RCS/SMS).  \n- Messages are AI-enhanced using OpenAI's `o4-mini` model to summarize incident reports with context and urgency.  \n- The workflow runs every hour, but this can be configured to match your needs.  \n- Each report is sent **only once**, thanks to persistent tracking of seen incident IDs in workflow static memory.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it Works\n\n1. **Trigger**: A Schedule Trigger (every hour) or manual start kicks off the flow.  \n2. **Get Alerts**: A `code` node fetches the latest PulsePoint incidents for a specified agency and decrypts the data.  \n3. **Filter New Incidents**: We store previously seen incident IDs to prevent duplicate alerts.  \n4. **Merge Incidents**: All new incident details are merged into a single payload.  \n5. **Condition Check**: If there are no new incidents, nothing is sent.  \n6. **AI Summary**: The incident data is passed to an AI agent for summarization with human-friendly emojis and formatting.  \n7. **Send Message**: The final summary is sent via Blooio’s API to your phone using iMessage.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 How to Use\n\n1. **Get Your PulsePoint Agency ID**:  \n   - Visit [https://web.pulsepoint.org](https://web.pulsepoint.org).  \n   - Find your agency by location or name.  \n   - Inspect the API call or browser network log to get the `agencyid` (e.g. `19100` from a URL like `?agencyid=19100`).  \n\n2. **Set Up Blooio for Messaging**:  \n   - Sign up at [https://blooio.com](https://blooio.com).  \n   - Go to your account and retrieve your Bearer API Key.  \n   - Pricing details available on their [pricing page](https://blooio.com#pricing).  \n   - Add your key to the HTTP Request node as a **Bearer Token**.  \n\n3. **OpenAI API**:  \n   - Create or use an existing OpenAI account.  \n   - Use the `o4-mini` model for efficient, readable summaries.  \n   - Get your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).  \n\n4. **Add Your Phone Number**:  \n   - Replace `+1111112222` with your actual number (international format).  \n   - You can also modify the message content or prepend special tags/emojis.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- **PulsePoint agency ID** – See usage instructions above  \n- **OpenAI API Key** – [Get API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)  \n- **Blooio Account & Bearer Token** – [Get Started](https://blooio.com)  \n- **Phone number** for iMessage delivery  \n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Customizing This Workflow\n\n- **Change the schedule** to get alerts more or less frequently  \n- **Add filters** to only get alerts for specific incident types (e.g. fires, traffic accidents)  \n- **Send to groups**: Expand to send alerts to multiple recipients or use Slack instead of iMessage  \n- **Use different AI prompts** to get detailed, humorous, or abbreviated alerts depending on your audience  \n\n---\n\nWith just a few credentials and a phone number, you’ll have real-time incident alerts with human-friendly summaries at your fingertips.\n\n🛠️ Stay informed.
