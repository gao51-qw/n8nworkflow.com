# Introduction
**Manual LinkedIn data collection is time-consuming, error-prone, and results
  in inconsistent data quality across CRM/database records.**

 This workflow is great for organizations that struggle with:
  - Incomplete contact records with only LinkedIn URLs but missing profile
  details
  - Hours spent manually copying LinkedIn information into databases
  - Inconsistent data formats due to copy-paste from LinkedIn (emojis, styled
  text, special characters)
  - Outdated profile information that doesn't reflect current roles/companies
  - No systematic way to enrich contacts at scale

## Primary Users
1.   Sales & Marketing Teams
2.   Event Organizers & Conference Managers for event materials
4.   Recruitment & HR Professionals
5.   CRM Administrators

## Specific Problems Addressed

  1. Data Completeness: Automatically fills missing profile fields (headline,
  bio, skills, experience)
  2. Data Quality: Sanitizes problematic characters that break
  databases/exports
  3. Time Efficiency: Reduces hours of manual data entry to automated monthly
  updates
  4. Error Handling: Gracefully manages invalid/deleted LinkedIn profiles
  5. Scalability: Processes multiple profiles in batch without manual
  intervention
  6. Standardization: Ensures consistent data format across all records

## Cost
Each URL scraped by Apify costs $0.01 to get all the data above. Apify charges per scrape, regardless of how much dta or fields you extract/use.

# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

  1. **n8n Instance:** Access to a running n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
  2. **NocoDB Account:** Database with a table containing LinkedIn URLs
  3. **Apify Account:** Free or paid account for LinkedIn scraping

## Required fields in NocoDB table

### Input:
* single LinkedIn URL

*NocoDB Field name*
```
LinkedIn
```

### Output:
* first/last/full name
* e-mail
* bio
* headline
* profile pic URL
* current role
* country
* skills
* current employer
* employer URL
* experiences (all previous jobs)
* personal website
* publications (articles)


*NocoDB Field names*
```
linkedin_full_name
linkedin_first_name: 
linkedin_headline:
linkedin_email:
linkedin_bio:
linkedin_profile_pic
linkedin_current_role
linkedin_current_company
linkedin_country
linkedin_skills
linkedin_company_website
linkedin_experiences
linkedin_personal_website
linkedin_publications
linkedin_scrape_error_reason
linkedin_scrape_last_attempt
linkedin_scrape_status
linkedin_last_modified
```

Technically you also need an Id field, but that is always there so no need to add it :)

    - Update field mappings to match your NocoDB table structure
    - Ensure these fields exist in your table:
        - LinkedIn (URL field)
      - linkedin_headline, linkedin_full_name, linkedin_bio, etc.
      - linkedin_scrape_status, linkedin_last_modified
###   5. Configure the Filter

###   6. Test the Workflow
    - Click "Execute Workflow" with Manual Trigger
    - Monitor execution for any errors
    - Verify data is properly updated in NocoDB
###   7. Activate Automated Schedule
    - Configure the Schedule Trigger node (default: monthly)
    - Toggle the workflow to "Active"
    - Monitor executions in n8n dashboard
