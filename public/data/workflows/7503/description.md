## 👥 Who the Automation is for

This automation is perfect for bloggers, solopreneurs, business owners, and marketing teams who want to **scale SEO content creation**. 

Instead of spending hours on research and drafting, you can go from a single keyword idea to a ready-to-edit WordPress draft in minutes.<br><br>

## ⚙️ How the Automation Works

**Collect keywords** in a Google Sheet and mark the ones you want as “prioritized.”

Click “Prepare Content” → your keyword(s) are sent to n8n.

n8n pulls the top 10 Google **SERP** results.

**AI analyzes competitors** (tone, content type, gaps) and creates a **content brief.**

Another AI generates a **blog draft** based on the brief.

The draft is automatically uploaded to WordPress and your sheet updates.

👉 In short: **Keyword → SERP → Brief → Draft → WordPress.**<br><br>
