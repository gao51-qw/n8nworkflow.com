  "title": "Automate B2B SaaS renewal risk management with CRM, support & usage data",
  "description": "## Description\n\nThis workflow is designed for B2B/SaaS teams who want to **secure renewals before it’s too late**.\n\nIt runs every day, identifies all accounts whose licenses are up for renewal in **J–30**, enriches them with CRM, product usage and support data, computes an internal churn risk level, and then triggers the appropriate playbook:\n\n- **HIGH risk** → full escalation (tasks, alerts, emails)\n- **MEDIUM risk** → proactive follow-up by Customer Success\n- **LOW risk** → light renewal touchpoint / monitoring\n\nEverything is logged into a database table so that you can build dashboards, run analysis, or plug additional automations on top.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n![image.png](fileId:3555)\n1. **Daily detection (J–30 renewals)**  \n   A scheduled trigger runs every morning and queries your database (Postgres / Supabase) to fetch all active subscriptions expiring in 30 days. Each row includes the account identifier, name, renewal date and basic commercial data.\n\n2. **Data enrichment across tools**  \n   For each account, the workflow calls several business systems to collect context:\n   - HubSpot → engagement history\n   - Salesforce → account profile and segment\n   - Pipedrive → deal activities and associated products\n   - Analytics API → product feature usage and activity trends\n   - Zendesk → recent support tickets and potential friction signals\n\n   All of this is merged into a single, unified item.\n\n3. **Churn scoring & routing**  \n   An internal scoring step evaluates the risk for each account based on multiple signals (engagement, usage, support, timing).  \n   The workflow then categorizes each account into one of three risk levels:\n\n   - **HIGH** – strong churn signals → needs immediate attention  \n   - **MEDIUM** – some warning signs → needs proactive follow-up  \n   - **LOW** – looks healthy → light renewal reminder\n\n   A `Switch` node routes each account to the relevant playbook.\n\n4. **Automated playbooks**\n\n   - 🔴 **HIGH risk**\n     - Create a Trello card on a dedicated “High-Risk Renewals” board/list  \n     - Create a Jira ticket for the CS / AM team  \n     - Send a Slack alert in a designated channel  \n     - Send a detailed email to the CSM and/or account manager\n\n   - 🟠 **MEDIUM risk**\n     - Create a Trello card in a “Renewals – Follow-up” list  \n     - Send a contextual email to the CSM to recommend a proactive check-in\n\n   - 🟢 **LOW risk**\n     - Send a soft renewal email / internal note to keep the account on the radar\n\n5. **Logging & daily reporting**\n   For every processed account, the workflow prepares a structured log record (account, renewal date, risk level, basic context).  \n   A Postgres node is used to insert the data into a `churn_logs` table.\n\n   At the end of each run, all processed accounts are aggregated and a **daily summary email** is sent (for example to the Customer Success leadership team), listing the renewals and their risk levels.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Database**  \n   - A table named `churn_logs` (or equivalent) to store workflow decisions and history.  \n     Example fields: `account_id`, `account_name`, `end_date`, `riskScore`, `riskLevel`, `playbook`, `trello_link`, `jira_link`, `timestamp`.\n\n2. **External APIs**  \n   - HubSpot (engagement data)  \n   - Salesforce (account profile)  \n   - Pipedrive (deals & products)  \n   - Zendesk (support tickets)  \n   - Optional: product analytics API for usage metrics\n\n3. **Communication & task tools**  \n   - Gmail (emails to CSM / AM / summary recipients)  \n   - Slack (alert channel for high-risk cases)  \n   - Trello (task creation for CS follow-up)  \n   - Jira (escalation tickets for high-risk renewals)\n\n4. **Configuration variables**  \n   - Thresholds are configured in the `Init config & thresholds` node:\n     - `days_before_renewal`\n     - `churn_threshold_high`\n     - `churn_threshold_medium`\n   - These parameters let you adapt the detection window and risk sensitivity to your own business rules.\n\n---\n\n## Typical use cases\n\n- Customer Success teams who want a **daily churn watchlist** without exporting spreadsheets.  \n- RevOps teams looking to **standardize renewal playbooks** across tools.  \n- SaaS companies who need to **prioritize renewals** based on real risk signals rather than gut feeling.  \n- Product-led organizations that want to combine **usage data + CRM + support** into one automated process.\n\n## Tutorial video\n[Watch the Youtube Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAxxSKRwz98)\n\n## About me :\nI’m Yassin a Project & Product Manager  Scaling tech products with data-driven project management.\n📬 Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yassin-zehar)",
