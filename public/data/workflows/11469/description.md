## Description

This workflow is designed for B2B/SaaS teams who want to **secure renewals before it’s too late**.

It runs every day, identifies all accounts whose licenses are up for renewal in **J–30**, enriches them with CRM, product usage and support data, computes an internal churn risk level, and then triggers the appropriate playbook:

- **HIGH risk** → full escalation (tasks, alerts, emails)
- **MEDIUM risk** → proactive follow-up by Customer Success
- **LOW risk** → light renewal touchpoint / monitoring

Everything is logged into a database table so that you can build dashboards, run analysis, or plug additional automations on top.

## How it works
![image.png](fileId:3555)
1. **Daily detection (J–30 renewals)**  
   A scheduled trigger runs every morning and queries your database (Postgres / Supabase) to fetch all active subscriptions expiring in 30 days. Each row includes the account identifier, name, renewal date and basic commercial data.

2. **Data enrichment across tools**  
   For each account, the workflow calls several business systems to collect context:
   - HubSpot → engagement history
   - Salesforce → account profile and segment
   - Pipedrive → deal activities and associated products
   - Analytics API → product feature usage and activity trends
   - Zendesk → recent support tickets and potential friction signals

   All of this is merged into a single, unified item.

3. **Churn scoring & routing**  
   An internal scoring step evaluates the risk for each account based on multiple signals (engagement, usage, support, timing).  
   The workflow then categorizes each account into one of three risk levels:

   - **HIGH** – strong churn signals → needs immediate attention  
   - **MEDIUM** – some warning signs → needs proactive follow-up  
   - **LOW** – looks healthy → light renewal reminder

   A `Switch` node routes each account to the relevant playbook.

4. **Automated playbooks**

   - 🔴 **HIGH risk**
     - Create a Trello card on a dedicated “High-Risk Renewals” board/list  
     - Create a Jira ticket for the CS / AM team  
     - Send a Slack alert in a designated channel  
     - Send a detailed email to the CSM and/or account manager

   - 🟠 **MEDIUM risk**
     - Create a Trello card in a “Renewals – Follow-up” list  
     - Send a contextual email to the CSM to recommend a proactive check-in

   - 🟢 **LOW risk**
     - Send a soft renewal email / internal note to keep the account on the radar

5. **Logging & daily reporting**
   For every processed account, the workflow prepares a structured log record (account, renewal date, risk level, basic context).  
   A Postgres node is used to insert the data into a `churn_logs` table.

   At the end of each run, all processed accounts are aggregated and a **daily summary email** is sent (for example to the Customer Success leadership team), listing the renewals and their risk levels.

## Requirements

1. **Database**  
   - A table named `churn_logs` (or equivalent) to store workflow decisions and history.  
     Example fields: `account_id`, `account_name`, `end_date`, `riskScore`, `riskLevel`, `playbook`, `trello_link`, `jira_link`, `timestamp`.

2. **External APIs**  
   - HubSpot (engagement data)  
   - Salesforce (account profile)  
   - Pipedrive (deals & products)  
   - Zendesk (support tickets)  
   - Optional: product analytics API for usage metrics

3. **Communication & task tools**  
   - Gmail (emails to CSM / AM / summary recipients)  
   - Slack (alert channel for high-risk cases)  
   - Trello (task creation for CS follow-up)  
   - Jira (escalation tickets for high-risk renewals)

4. **Configuration variables**  
   - Thresholds are configured in the `Init config & thresholds` node:
     - `days_before_renewal`
     - `churn_threshold_high`
     - `churn_threshold_medium`
   - These parameters let you adapt the detection window and risk sensitivity to your own business rules.

## Typical use cases

- Customer Success teams who want a **daily churn watchlist** without exporting spreadsheets.  
- RevOps teams looking to **standardize renewal playbooks** across tools.  
- SaaS companies who need to **prioritize renewals** based on real risk signals rather than gut feeling.  
- Product-led organizations that want to combine **usage data + CRM + support** into one automated process.
