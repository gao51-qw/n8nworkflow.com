## How it Works
This workflow uses **VEO3** to generate **surreal cinematic AI videos** at a fraction of the cost compared to Google’s standard video generation APIs.  
With it, you can automatically run a **YouTube Shorts channel** (and optionally Instagram uploads) that posts **new AI videos every day**  completely automated.  

### Workflow Overview  
1. **Schedule Trigger**  
   - Runs automatically at your chosen times (e.g., twice per day).  

2. **AI Prompt Generator**  
   - Creates a detailed video idea based on your chosen niche.  
   - You only need to adapt the system prompt to your theme (e.g., *Travel Facts, Tech Visuals, Mini-Facts, Impossible Realities, Food Illusions*).  
   - Output includes:  
     - **Video Prompt** (for VEO3 API)  
     - **Social Caption** with hashtags  
     - **YouTube Title**  
     - **YouTube Description**  

3. **VEO3 Video Generation**  
   - Sends the prompt to **KIE AI VEO3** (model: `veo3_fast`).  
   - Produces **9:16 vertical short-form videos** optimized for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels.  
   - Significantly **cheaper than Google’s Video AI** while delivering cinematic quality.  

4. **Publishing**  
   - Uploads automatically to **YouTube Shorts** (with AI-generated titles, descriptions, tags).  
   - In parallel, posts the same video to a **Telegram channel** (Instagram upload possible with a small modification).
