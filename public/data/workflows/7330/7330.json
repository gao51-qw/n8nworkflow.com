    "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow automatically responds to incoming emails identified as potential leads using AI-generated text.  \nIt connects to your email inbox via IMAP, classifies incoming messages with an AI model, filters out non-leads, and sends a personalized reply to relevant messages.\n\n## Steps\n1. **Email Trigger (IMAP):** Watches your inbox for new emails in real time.\n2. **Is Lead? (Message Model):** Uses AI to determine whether the sender is a lead.\n3. **Filter:** Passes only lead emails to the next step.\n4. **Write Customized Reply (Message Model):** Generates a personalized response using AI.\n5. **Get Message:** Retrieves original email details to ensure correct threading.\n6. **Reply to Message:** Sends the AI-generated reply to the sender.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n- Connect your **IMAP Email** credentials to the first node and set the folder to watch (e.g., INBOX).\n- In the \"Filter leads\" node, adjust the AI prompt to match your lead qualification criteria.\n- In the \"Reply with customized message\" node, edit the AI prompt to reflect your product, service, or business tone.\n- Connect your **Gmail** (or other email provider) credentials in the Get Message and Reply to Message nodes.\n- Test with a few sample emails before activating.\n\n## Requirements\n- IMAP-enabled email account (for receiving messages)\n- Gmail API access (or modify to your email provider)\n- OpenAI or other AI model credentials for message analysis and reply generation\n\nThis template is ready to use, with all steps documented inside sticky notes for easy customization.\n",
