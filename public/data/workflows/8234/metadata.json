  "description": "⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This workflow uses Google Calendar and Gmail nodes which you will have to configure yourself  \n\n## Who’s it for\nAnyone who wants an **AI-powered personal assistant** that can handle Gmail and Google Calendar tasks through a simple webhook. This is useful for developers, small teams, and productivity enthusiasts who want to connect a chatbot (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, or custom frontends) to their email and calendar.\n\n## How it works / What it does\nThis workflow acts as a **chat-based AI assistant**. You send text requests through a webhook (e.g., from a chatbot), and the AI agent interprets them to take actions like:\n\n- 📧 Sending emails in Gmail  \n- 📥 Reading and summarizing your emails  \n- 📅 Checking your Google Calendar events  \n- ✅ Checking your availability before booking  \n- 📝 Creating new calendar events with Google Meet links  \n- ✏️ Updating existing events  \n- ⏰ Converting natural time expressions like “tomorrow at 3 PM” into exact timestamps  \n\nThe AI agent is powered by the **Google Gemini Chat Model (or any LLM you choose)** and follows strict guardrails:\n- Confirms actions before executing  \n- Asks for clarification if details are missing  \n- Prevents double-booking by checking availability  \n\n## How to set up\n1. Import this workflow into n8n.  \n2. Set up credentials for:  \n   - Gmail (OAuth2)  \n   - Google Calendar (OAuth2)  \n   - AI provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, etc.)  \n3. Configure the webhook node (`/chat`) as your chatbot endpoint.  \n   - You can connect it to Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, or a frontend app.  \n4. Customize the AI Agent’s system prompt if you want to tweak tone or rules.  \n5. Deploy and start sending messages like:  \n   - “Check my emails from today”  \n   - “Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 3 PM”  \n   - “Email my team about the deadline extension”  \n\n## Requirements\n- n8n installed and running (cloud or self-hosted)  \n- Gmail and Google Calendar accounts with API access  \n- API key for your chosen AI provider\n- [Webhook Chatbot interface](https://github.com/Praneel7015/webhook-chatbot-interface)  \n\n## How to customize\n- Swap **Google Gemini** with another LLM node (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Anthropic Claude).  \n- Add more tools (e.g., Slack, Notion, Trello) to extend capabilities.  \n- Adjust memory length in the **Simple Memory** node.  \n- Modify sticky notes with instructions tailored to your use case.  \n\n## Disclaimer\n- This workflow uses the **community webhook entry point**, so it is best suited for **self-hosted n8n instances**.  \n- Do not hardcode API keys or sensitive credentials. Always use n8n’s **Credentials** system.  \n## Other Details\nThanks for viewing this automation!\nFeel Free to contact me at [praneel.tech](https://www.praneel.tech)\nAlso Use [my Webhook chatbot interface](https://github.com/Praneel7015/webhook-chatbot-interface) Which is configured perfectly for n8n Automations!",
