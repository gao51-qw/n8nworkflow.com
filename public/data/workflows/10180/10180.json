    "description": "# This n8n template demonstrates how to automate blog post creation with AI and WordPress\n\nThis workflow is designed for creators who want to maintain an active blog without spending hours writing — while still taking advantage of SEO benefits.  \nIt connects **OpenAI** and **WordPress** to help you **schedule AI-generated posts** or **create content from simple one- or two-word prompts**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Good to know\n\nAt the time of writing, each AI-generated post will use your **OpenAI API credits** according to your model and usage tier.  \nThis workflow requires an active **WordPress site** with API access and your **OpenAI API key**.  \nSetup is quick — in less than **5 minutes**, you can have everything running smoothly!\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n\n1. The workflow connects to your **WordPress API** and your **OpenAI account**.  \n2. You can choose between two modes:  \n   - **Scheduled mode:** AI automatically creates and publishes posts based on your defined schedule.  \n   - **Prompt mode:** Enter a short phrase (one or two words) and let AI generate a complete SEO-optimized post.  \n3. The generated content is formatted and published directly to your WordPress blog.  \n4. You can easily customize prompts, post styles, or scheduling frequency to match your brand and goals.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to use\n\n- Start with the **Manual Trigger** node (as an example) — or replace it with other triggers such as **webhooks**, **cron jobs**, or **form submissions**.  \n- Adjust your **OpenAI prompts** to fine-tune the tone, structure, or SEO focus of your posts.  \n- You can also extend this workflow to automatically share posts on social media or send notifications when new articles go live.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- Active **OpenAI API key**  \n- **WordPress site** with API access  \n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Customising this workflow\n\nAI-powered content creation can be adapted for many purposes. Try using it for:  \n- Automated **content calendars**  \n- Generating **product descriptions**  \n- Creating **newsletter drafts**  \n- Building **SEO-focused blogs** effortlessly  \n",

It will be read and reviewed by other professionals.\n\nThe current blog topics (slugs) are: {{ $json.slugs }} — use them throughout the text, along with external links, to increase the reliability of my site. Do not use “openai referrer” or relative links; always use the original link and nothing else. Understand whether I’m sending you a complete piece of content or a specific topic.

Ensure the content is extremely relevant and complete, aiming for 3,000–7,000 words.\n\nInclude internal links to similar posts distributed throughout the text. \n\nThe base URL for my blog posts is [https://yourblog.com/blog/[slug](https://yourblog.com/blog/[slug)]. Insert 1–5 internal links, always matching keywords meaningfully.\n\n**Final Section**\nAvoid generic AI-style summaries; instead, provide insights or practical actions. Do not use the word “conclusion” or similar terms—just complete your reasoning naturally.\n\n**HTML Formatting**\nEnsure the article is properly structured in HTML format:\n\n* Titles: Use <h1>, <h2>, <h3> appropriately.\n* Paragraphs: Wrap text in <p>.\n* Highlighted Words: Use <strong> to emphasize important terms.\n* Lists: Use <ul> and <li> for bullet points.\n  Keep the output clean and well-structured, avoiding plain text. Never include suggestions or comments in your responses.\n\n**Final JSON Format**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"{Generate an H1 title aligned with market trends, with high click potential, following the keyword strategy. The title should use capitalization only for the first word or proper nouns'}\",\n  \"content\": \"{Generate a complete article in HTML including H1, H2, H3 titles, paragraphs, lists, etc.}\",\n  \"slug\": \"{Generate a unique, SEO-friendly slug with as few words as possible (minimum of 2), separated by hyphens, such as gina-2025 or 10-better-choices.
