  "description": "## Description\nThis workflow is a **practical, “dirty” solution** for real-world scenarios where frontline workers keep using Excel in their daily processes.  \nInstead of forcing change, we take their spreadsheets as-is, clean and normalize the data, generate embeddings, and store everything in Supabase.\n\nThe benefit: frontline staff continue with their familiar tools, while **data analysts gain clean, structured, and vectorized data** ready for analysis or RAG-style AI applications.\n\n## How it works\n- **Frontline workers continue with Excel** – no disruption to their daily routines.  \n- **Upload & trigger** – The workflow runs when a new Excel sheet is ready.  \n- **Read Excel rows** – Data is pulled from the specified workbook and worksheet.  \n- **Clean & normalize** – HTML is stripped, Excel dates are fixed, and text fields are standardized.  \n- **Batch & switch** – Rows are split and routed into Question/Answer processing paths.  \n- **Generate embeddings** – Cleaned Questions and Answers are converted into vectors via OpenAI.  \n- **Merge enriched records** – Original business data is combined with embeddings.  \n- **Write into Supabase** – Data lands in a structured table (`excel_records`) with vector and FTS indexes.  \n\n## Why it’s “dirty but useful”\n- **No disruption** – frontline workers don’t need to change how they work.  \n- **Analyst-ready data** – Supabase holds clean, queryable data for dashboards, reporting, or AI pipelines.  \n- **Bridge between old and new** – Excel remains the input, but the backend becomes modern and scalable.  \n- **Incremental modernization** – paves the way for future workflow upgrades without blocking current work.  \n\n## Outcome\nFrontline workers keep their Excel-based workflows, while **data can immediately be structured, searchable, and vectorized in Supabase** — enabling AI-powered search, reporting, and retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n\n## Required setup\n\n**Supabase account**\n- Create a project and enable the **pgvector** extension. \n\n**OpenAI API Key** \n  - Required for generating embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`).  \n\n**Microsoft Excel credentials**\n  - Needed to connect to your workbook and worksheet.  \n\n- ## Need Help\n🔗 [LinkedIn – Wessel Bulte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wessel-bulte/)\n",
