    "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow is your automated sales assistant, designed to intelligently qualify incoming leads and route them to the most appropriate follow-up channel. It uses the powerful **BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing)** framework, powered by Google Gemini AI, to score leads as 'hot', 'mid', or 'cold', ensuring your sales team focuses on the most promising opportunities.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Lead Capture:** A public `Form Trigger` collects essential lead information, including their name, email, what they want to build, their budget, desired start time, and job role. These questions are specifically designed to gather BANT data.\n2.  **AI Lead Scoring:** The collected data is sent to **Google Gemini**. A detailed prompt instructs the AI to act as a Lead Scoring Expert, evaluating each BANT component individually and then assigning an overall 'hot', 'mid', or 'cold' score based on predefined criteria.\n3.  **Intelligent Routing:** A `Switch` node acts as the central router. Based on the AI's 'hot', 'mid', or 'cold' score, the workflow directs the lead down one of three distinct follow-up paths.\n4.  **Hot Leads (Calendar Booking):** For highly qualified 'hot' leads, the workflow immediately redirects them to your calendar booking link, making it easy for them to schedule a direct conversation.\n5.  **Mid Leads (WhatsApp Engagement):** For 'mid' priority leads, **Google Gemini** generates a personalized, pre-filled WhatsApp message summarizing their inquiry. The lead is then redirected to a WhatsApp chat with your sales team, allowing for quick, informal engagement.\n6.  **Cold Leads (Nurturing Email):** For 'cold' leads who might be in an early research phase, **Google Gemini** crafts a helpful, non-salesy follow-up email. This email provides valuable resources (like templates or community links) and is sent via Gmail, keeping them engaged without pressure.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~10-15 minutes**\n\nThis workflow requires connecting your Google AI and Gmail accounts, and customizing several nodes to fit your sales process.\n\n1.  **Get Your Google AI API Key:**\n    *   Visit Google AI Studio at [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).\n    *   Click **\"Create API key in new project\"** and copy the key.\n    *   In the workflow, select the **`Score Lead`** node. Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`**.\n    *   Paste your key into the **API Key** field and **Save**.\n    *   Repeat this for the **`Write Placeholder WA Message`** and **`Write Follow up Email`** nodes, selecting the credential you just created.\n\n2.  **Connect Your Gmail Account:**\n    *   Select the **`Send Follow up Email with Gmail`** node.\n    *   Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`** to connect your Google account. Follow the prompts to grant n8n access.\n\n3.  **Customize Lead Scoring Criteria:**\n    *   Go to the **`Score Lead`** node.\n    *   In the **Text** parameter, carefully review and adapt the `BANT Criteria Mapping` and `Scoring Logic` to align with your specific sales process and ideal customer profile. This is crucial for accurate lead qualification.\n\n4.  **Configure Follow-up Channels:**\n    *   **Hot Leads:** Select the **`Calendar Booking Link`** node. Update the `redirectUrl` parameter with **your personal or team's calendar booking link** (e.g., Calendly, Chili Piper).\n    *   **Mid Leads:** Select the **`Phone Number`** node. Set the `whatsapp_phone` value to **your company's WhatsApp phone number** (e.g., `+15551234567`). You can also customize the pre-filled WhatsApp message by adjusting the prompt in the **`Write Placeholder WA Message`** node.\n    *   **Cold Leads:** Select the **`Redirect to Website`** node. Update the `redirectUrl` parameter to **your company's main website or a relevant resource page** (e.g., a free templates page, a blog post). You can also customize the email content and resources shared by adjusting the prompt in the **`Write Follow up Email`** node.\n\n5.  **Activate and Test:**\n    *   Activate the workflow using the toggle at the top right.\n    *   Go to the **`Lead Contact Form`** node and click the **\"Open Form URL\"** button.\n    *   Submit several test applications with different answers (e.g., one \"hot\" lead, one \"mid\", one \"cold\") to ensure the AI scores them correctly and they are routed to the appropriate follow-up action.\n\nStart qualifying and engaging your leads more effectively!",

Avoid sales-y language.\n- **Personalization:** Address the lead by their first name (derived from their full name).\n- **Acknowledge Input:** Briefly mention their submission and their stated interest/need to show you've paid attention.\n- **Validate Their Stage:** Acknowledge that they might be in a learning or research phase. This builds trust.\n- **Provide Value (The Core):** The primary CTA should be to explore the free templates. The paid community should be positioned as a secondary, optional resource for those who want deeper, live support.\n- **Soft Call-to-Action (CTA):** The main CTA is to explore the free templates. The secondary CTA is to let them know you're here for them in the future if/when their needs change.\n- **Tone:** Helpful, encouraging, welcoming, and low-pressure.\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Ask them to book a call or demo.\n- Use urgent or pushy sales language.\n- Ask for more information.\n</context>\n\n<examples>\n<example_1>\n<inputs>\n<full_name>Alex Ray</full_name>\n<email>alex.r@university.edu</email>\n<need>Just learning how to use n8n for a personal project</need>\n<budget>no budget</budget>\n<timing>no timeline</timing>\n<authority>Student</authority>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n\"subject\": \"Resources for your n8n learning journey\",\n\"body\": \"Hi Alex,\\n\\nThanks for reaching out on our website about your personal project with n8n.
