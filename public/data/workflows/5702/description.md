# 🚀 **Automated Stripe Payment Recovery Workflow (n8n)**

Detect failed payments, log them, and send polite follow-up emails to recover revenue — all automated with n8n.

---

## ✅ **Part A – Detect & log failed payments**

**What it does:**

* Listens for failed Stripe payments.
* Extracts customer & payment info.
* Logs them neatly in Google Sheets for follow-up.

**🧩 Nodes:**

1️⃣ **Stripe Trigger**

* Listens to:

  ```
  payment_intent.payment_failed
  ```

2️⃣ **Set node**

* Extracts & maps fields:

  * Name, Email, Amount (in cents), Currency
  * payment\_intent\_id
  * added\_at → `{{ $now }}`
  * email\_sent\_count → `0`

3️⃣ **Remove Duplicates**

* Keeps the sheet clean (avoids duplicate rows).

4️⃣ **Google Sheets node**

* Append or update row:

  * Name, Email, Amount/100, Currency, payment\_intent\_id, added\_at, email\_sent\_count

&gt; 📌 This builds your “failed payments queue” to drive the follow-up emails later.

## 🔁 **Part B – Daily follow-up emails**

**What it does:**

* Runs daily.
* Checks which users haven’t received 2 emails yet.
* Sends reminder emails and tracks how many were sent.

**🧩 Nodes:**
1️⃣ **Schedule Trigger**

* Runs every day at 10 AM (`0 10 * * *`)

2️⃣ **Get Payment Failure Leads**

* Reads rows from Google Sheet.

3️⃣ **Switch node (Check for no. of emails sent)**

* If `email_sent_count &lt; 1` → send first email.
* Else if `email_sent_count &lt; 2` → send second email.
* Else → mark as "quit sending emails".

4️⃣ **Send First Email**

* Sends a gentle reminder with billing page button.

5️⃣ **Update Email Count**

* Increments `email_sent_count` by +1 in Google Sheets.

6️⃣ **Send Second Email**

* Sends final, urgent reminder.

7️⃣ **Quit Sending Emails to these Leads**

* Marks that no more emails should be sent.
