  "title": "Stock market technical analysis alerts with Alpha Vantage & Discord",
  "description": "### This n8n template demonstrates how to automate stock market technical analysis to detect key trading signals and send real-time alerts to Discord. It's built to monitor for the **Golden Cross** (a bullish signal) and the **Death Cross** (a bearish signal) using simple moving averages.\n\nUse cases are many: Automate your personal trading strategy, monitor a portfolio for significant trend changes, or provide automated analysis highlights for a trading community or client group.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Good to know\n\n* This template relies on the **Alpha Vantage API**, which has a free tier with usage limits (e.g., API calls per minute and per day). Be mindful of these limits, especially if monitoring many tickers.\n* The data provided by free APIs may have a slight delay and is intended for informational and analysis purposes.\n* **Disclaimer**: This workflow is an informational tool and does not constitute financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment decisions.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n\n* The workflow triggers automatically every weekday at 5 PM, after the typical market close.\n* It fetches a list of user-defined stock tickers from the **Set** node.\n* For each stock, it gets the latest daily price data from **Alpha Vantage** via an HTTP Request and stores the new data in a **PostgreSQL** database to maintain a history.\n* The workflow then queries the database for the last 121 days of data for each stock.\n* A **Code node** calculates two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs): a short-term (60-day) and a long-term (120-day) average for both today and the previous day.\n* Using **If** nodes, it compares the SMAs to see if a **Golden Cross** (short-term crosses above long-term) or a **Death Cross** (short-term crosses below long-term) has just occurred.\n* Finally, a formatted alert message is sent to a specified **Discord** channel via a webhook.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to use\n\n* Configure your credentials for **PostgreSQL** and select them in the two database nodes.\n* Get a free **Alpha Vantage API Key** and add it to the \"Fetch Daily History\" node. For best practice, create a Header Auth credential for it.\n* Paste your **Discord Webhook URL** into the final \"HTTP Request\" node.\n* Update the list of stock symbols in the \"Set - Ticker List\" node to monitor the assets you care about.\n* The workflow is set to run on a schedule, but you can press \"Test workflow\" to trigger it manually at any time.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n* An **Alpha Vantage** account for an API key.\n* A **PostgreSQL** database to store historical price data.\n* A **Discord** account and a server where you can create a webhook.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Customising this workflow\n\n* Easily change the moving average periods (e.g., from 60/120 to 50/200) by adjusting the `SMA_SHORT` and `SMA_LONG` variables in the \"Compute 60/120 SMAs\" Code node.\n* Modify the alert messages in the \"Set - Golden Cross Msg\" and \"Set - Death Cross Msg\" nodes.\n* Swap out Discord for another notification service like **Slack** or **Telegram** by replacing the final HTTP Request node.",
