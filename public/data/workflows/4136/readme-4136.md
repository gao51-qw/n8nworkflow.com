# WhatsApp expense tracker with PostgreSQL database & AI-powered reports

> # Track Personal Finances with WhatsApp and AI Assistant

Transform your WhatsApp into a powerful personal finance command center. This AI-powered workflow converts natural language messages into structured financial data, automates record-keeping, and delivers instant insights—all within your favorite messaging app.

## Who is this for?

This template is perfect for:
- **Personal finance enthusiasts** who want effortless expense tracking
- **Small business owners** managing personal and business expenses  
- **Freelancers** tracking income and expenses across projects
- **Anyone** who prefers messaging over complex finance apps
- **Users seeking privacy** with self-hosted financial data

## What problem is this workflow solving?

Traditional expense tracking requires switching between apps, manual data entry, and complex spreadsheets. Most people abandon these systems within weeks. This workflow solves the friction by:
- Eliminating app-switching—everything happens in WhatsApp
- Converting natural language to structured data automatically
- Providing instant confirmations and reports
- Requiring zero learning curve or behavior change

## What this workflow does

### Smart Transaction Processing
Send natural messages like `Spent 300 on groceries at Walmart` and the AI automatically extracts:
- **Date**: Today's date (or specified date)
- **Category**: Groceries  
- **Type**: Expense/Income/Debt
- **Amount**: 300
- **Person/Company**: Walmart

### Intelligent Message Classification
The workflow automatically routes messages to three processing branches:
- **Branch 1**: Reports and analytics (`show March expenses`)
- **Branch 2**: Transaction logging (`spent 50 on coffee`)  
- **Branch 3**: General financial chat (`how can I save money?`)

### Advanced Reporting
Generate instant reports by messaging:
- `today's report` → Daily income/expense summary
- `March vs April report` → Monthly comparisons with percentages
- `show groceries spending` → Category-specific analysis
- Automatic daily summaries at your preferred time

### Database Integration
All transactions are stored in PostgreSQL with proper schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE financial_transactions (
 date DATE NOT NULL,
 category TEXT NOT NULL, 
 type TEXT NOT NULL,
 amount NUMERIC(12,2) NOT NULL,
 person TEXT
);
```
