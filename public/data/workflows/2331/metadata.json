  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how to automate indexing of images to build a object-based image search.\n\nBy utilising a Detr-Resnet-50 Object Classification model, we can identify objects within an image and store these associations in Elasticsearch along with a reference to the image.\n\n## How it works\n\n* An image is imported into the workflow via HTTP request node.\n* The image is then sent to Cloudflare's Worker AI API where the service runs the image through the Detr-Resnet-50 object classification model.\n* The API returns the object associations with their positions in the image, labels and confidence score of the classification.\n* Confidence scores of less the 0.9 are discarded for brevity.\n* The image's URL and its associations are then index in an ElasticSearch server ready for searching.\n\n## Requirements\n* A Cloudflare account with Workers AI enabled to access the object classification model.\n* An ElasticSearch instance to store the image url and related associations.\n\n## Extending this workflow\nFurther enrich your indexed data with additional attributes or metrics relevant to your users.\n\nUse a vectorstore to provide similarity search over the images.",
