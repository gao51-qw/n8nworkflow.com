This n8n workflow demonstrates how to automate indexing of images to build a object-based image search.

By utilising a Detr-Resnet-50 Object Classification model, we can identify objects within an image and store these associations in Elasticsearch along with a reference to the image.

## How it works

* An image is imported into the workflow via HTTP request node.
* The image is then sent to Cloudflare's Worker AI API where the service runs the image through the Detr-Resnet-50 object classification model.
* The API returns the object associations with their positions in the image, labels and confidence score of the classification.
* Confidence scores of less the 0.9 are discarded for brevity.
* The image's URL and its associations are then index in an ElasticSearch server ready for searching.

## Requirements
* A Cloudflare account with Workers AI enabled to access the object classification model.
* An ElasticSearch instance to store the image url and related associations.

## Extending this workflow
Further enrich your indexed data with additional attributes or metrics relevant to your users.

Use a vectorstore to provide similarity search over the images.
