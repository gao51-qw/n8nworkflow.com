# 🎯 Automated B2B Cold Email Sequence with AI Personalization

Stop manually sending follow-ups. This workflow automates your entire cold email outreach with AI-powered personalization, smart scheduling, and automatic reply detection.

## ✨ What It Does

This workflow sends a perfectly-timed 3-email sequence to B2B prospects with:

- **AI-generated personalized emails** adapted to each prospect's sector, company size, and role
- **Smart scheduling**: Only sends Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday at optimal times (~9AM with randomization)
- **Bilingual support**: Auto-detects French or English prospects
- **Reply detection**: Automatically stops the sequence when someone replies
- **Spam prevention**: Randomized sending times, professional intervals
- **Full tracking**: Updates Google Sheets with send status and reply detection
- **Slack notifications**: Get alerted immediately when a hot lead responds

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on real usage:
- **10-15% reply rate** (vs 3-8% for generic cold emails)
- **2-5 hot leads** per 30 prospects contacted
- **90% time saved** vs manual outreach
- **Professional delivery** that preserves sender reputation

## 🎬 How It Works

1. **Add prospect** to Google Sheet (Email, Name, Company, etc.)
2. **Workflow triggers** automatically on new row
3. **Time planning** calculates optimal send dates (Tue/Wed/Thu only)
4. **Email 1** (J0): AI generates introduction with value prop (80-120 words)
5. **Wait 3 days**
6. **Email 2** (J+3): Follow-up with new angle or case study (70-90 words)
7. **Wait 4 days**
8. **Email 3** (J+7): Final soft close, respectful exit (60-100 words)
9. **Reply detection**: Monitors Gmail → marks prospect "hot" → Slack alert → stops sequence
