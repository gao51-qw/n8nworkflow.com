🛡️ Note

Failure to correctly configure Azure permissions will prevent the template from functioning. Ensure admin approval is fully completed during setup.

## **Important Prerequisites**

⚠️ Administrator consent is required

This template requires a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator or Application Administrator to grant admin consent to a set of Microsoft Graph and SharePoint API scopes.

Basic Azure App Registration knowledge is required:

You need to set up an Azure App Registration manually, configure OAuth2 authentication, and assign specific API permissions.

A setup guide is included, but familiarity with:

- App registrations
- API permissions
- Client secrets
- OAuth2 flows

is highly recommended.

Knowledge of Postgres is required
The template includes a SQL script to create the required Postgres table (see blog post).

You are responsible for hosting your own database (You can use Supabase with the Postgres connection string).
