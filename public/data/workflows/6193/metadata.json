  "description": "## Description\n\nThis workflow automates the download of new or updated files from a Google Drive folder, processing only files changed since the last run using a timestamp control file.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- Triggered on a schedule.\n- Checks for a `n8n_last_run.txt` file in your Google Drive to read when the workflow last ran.\n- If missing, defaults to processing changes in the last 24 hours.\n- Searches for new or modified files in your specified folder.\n- Downloads new/changed files.\n- Replaces the timestamp file with the current time for future runs.\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1. Set up your Google Drive credentials in n8n.\n2. Find the Folder ID of the Google Drive folder you wish to monitor.\n3. Edit all Google Drive nodes:\n    - Select your credentials\n    - Paste the Folder ID\n4. Adjust the schedule trigger if needed.\n5. Activate the workflow.\n\n## Features\n\n- No duplicate file processing (idempotent)\n- Handles missing timestamp files\n- Clear logical sticky notes in the editor\n- Modular, extendable design\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Google Drive API credentials connected to n8n\n- Target Google Drive folder accessible by the credentials\n\n",
