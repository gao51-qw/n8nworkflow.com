# 📊 Generate Weekly Energy Consumption Reports with API, Email and Google Drive

This workflow automates the process of retrieving energy consumption data, formatting it into a CSV report, and distributing it every week via **email** and **Google Drive**.

## ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps:
- Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
- Configure your API, email details and Google Drive folder.
- (Optional) Adjust the **CRON schedule** if you need a different time or frequency.
- Activate workflow—automated weekly reports begin immediately.

## 🎯 Who’s It For
Energy providers, sustainability departments, facility managers, renewable energy operators.

## 🛠 Requirements
- n8n instance
- Energy Consumption API access
- Google Drive account
- Email SMTP access

## ⚙️ How It Works
Workflow triggers every Monday at 8 AM, fetches consumption data, emails CSV report and saves a copy to Google Drive.

## 🔄 Workflow Steps

### 1. **Schedule Weekly (Mon 8:00 AM)**
- Type: **Cron Node**
- Runs every Monday at 8:00 AM.
- Triggers the workflow execution automatically.

### 2. **Fetch Energy Data**
- Type: **HTTP Request Node**
- Makes a GET request to:
```
https://api.energidataservice.dk/dataset/ConsumptionDE35Hour
(sample API)
```
- The API returns JSON data with hourly electricity consumption in Denmark.

**Sample Response Structure:**
```json
{
"records": [
{
"HourDK": "2025-08-25T01:00:00",
"MunicipalityNo": ___,
"MunicipalityName": "Copenhagen",
"ConsumptionkWh": 12345.67
}
]
}
```

### 3. **Normalize Records**
- Type: **Code Node**
- Extracts the `records` array from the API response and maps each entry into separate JSON items for easier handling downstream.
- Code used:
```javascript
const itemlist = $input.first().json.records;
return itemlist.map(r =&gt; ({ json: r }));
```

### 4. **Convert to File**
- Type: **Convert to File Node**
- Converts the array of JSON records into a **CSV file**.
- The CSV is stored in a binary field called `data`.

### 5. **Send Email Weekly Report**
- Type: **Email Send Node**
- Sends the generated CSV file as an **attachment**.
- Parameters:
- `fromEmail`: Sender email address (configure in node).
- `toEmail`: Recipient email address.
- `subject`: `"Weekly Energy Consumption Report"`.
- `attachments`: `=data` (binary data from the previous node).

### 6. **Report File Upload to Google Drive**
- Type: **Google Drive Node**
- Uploads the CSV file to your Google Drive root folder.
- Filename pattern:
```
energy_report_{{ $now.format('yyyy_MM_dd_HH_ii_ss') }}
```
- Requires valid Google Drive OAuth2 credentials.

## ✨ How To Customize
Change report frequency, email template, data format (CSV/Excel) or add-ons.

## ➕ Add-ons
- Integration with analytics tools (Power BI, Tableau)
- Additional reporting formats (Excel, PDF)
- Slack notifications

## 🚦 Use Case Examples
- Automated weekly/monthly reporting for compliance
- Historical consumption tracking
- Operational analytics and forecasting

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Data not fetched | API endpoint incorrect | Verify URL |
| Email delivery issues | SMTP configuration incorrect | Verify SMTP |
| Drive save fails | Permissions/Drive ID incorrect | Check Drive permissions |
