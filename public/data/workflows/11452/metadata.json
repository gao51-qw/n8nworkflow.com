This workflow replaces dozens of individual notification emails with a single, structured daily digest.\n\n### How it works\n*   **Ingest:** Fetches unread Google Alerts emails from your Gmail inbox.\n*   **Clean:** Extracts article links, scrapes the website content, and strips away ads and clutter to ensure high-quality AI processing.\n*   **Analyze:** Uses Google Gemini to summarize each article into a concise 2-4 sentence overview.\n*   **Deliver:** Compiles a professional HTML email report sorted by topic, sends it to you, and automatically marks the original alerts as read.\n\n### Set up steps\n*   **Connect Gmail:** Authenticate your Gmail account to allow reading alerts and sending the digest.\n*   **Connect Gemini:** Add your Google Gemini API key.\n*   **Configure Recipient:** Update the **Send Email Digest** node with your desired destination email address.\n*   **Schedule:** (Optional) Replace the Manual Trigger with a **Schedule Trigger** (e.g., every morning at 7 AM) to fully automate the process.",
