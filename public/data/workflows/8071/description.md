This n8n workflow securely processes contact form submissions by validating user input, formatting the data, and storing it in a MongoDB database. The flow ensures data consistency, prevents unsafe entries, and provides a confirmation response back to the user.


**Workflow**

**1. Form Submission Node**

*Purpose*: Serves as the workflow’s entry point.

*Functionality*: Captures user input from the contact form, which typically includes:

```
name
```
```
last name
```
```
email
```
```
phone number
```


**2. Code Node (Validation Layer)**

*Purpose*: Ensures that collected data is valid and secure.

*Validations performed*: 

- Removes suspicious characters to mitigate risks like SQL injection or script injection.

- Validates the phone_number field format (numeric, correct length, etc.).

- If any field fails validation, the entry is marked as “is_not_valid” to block it from database insertion.

**3. Edit Fields Node (Data Formatting)**

*Purpose*: Normalizes data before database insertion.

*Transformations applied:*

- Converts field names to snake_case (*first_name, last_name, phone_number*).

- Standardizes field naming convention for consistency in MongoDB storage.

**4. MongoDB Node (Insert Documents)**

*Purpose*: Persists validated data in MongoDB Atlas.

*Process*:

- Inserts documents into the target collection with the cleaned and formatted fields.

- Connection is established securely using a MongoDB Atlas connection string (URI).


🔧 How to Set Up MongoDB Atlas Connection URL



a. Create a Cluster

b. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChsSEwiD276cwbOPAxVpKkQIHTFOCpMYACICCAEQAxoCZHo&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwsrFBhD6ARIsAPnUFD3UpSa_1KFmRsdiOYmSRl0oXmh3kC8g8ZhGf8TOhiUsLGbHnwf046AaAgufEALw_wcB&cce=2&category=acrcp_v1_32&sig=AOD64_36CMbBMVgqf0cvThw5lpmpl-cMcQ&q&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiVzbScwbOPAxUzuJUCHQCKMnUQqyQoAXoECBcQDw) and create a new cluster.

c. Configure Database Access: Add a database user with a secure username and password, Assign appropriate roles (e.g., Atlas Admin for full access or Read/Write for limited).

d. Obtain Connection String (URI)

From Atlas, go to Clusters → Connect → Drivers.

Copy the provided connection string, which looks like:

```
mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.abcd123.mongodb.net/myDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

- Configure in n8n In the MongoDB node, paste the URI.

Replace &lt;username&gt;, &lt;password&gt;, and myDatabase with your actual credentials and database name.

- Test the connection to ensure it is successful.

**5. Form Ending Node**

*Purpose*: Provides closure to the workflow.

*Functionality*: Sends a confirmation response back to the user, indicating that their contact details were successfully submitted and stored.

✅ **Result**: With this workflow, all contact form submissions are safely validated, normalized, and stored in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring both data integrity and security basic.
