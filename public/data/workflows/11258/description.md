### 🏗️ What this automation does

| Step | Component | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Form Trigger** | Captures a new lead’s Name + Email |
| 2 | **AI Lead Enricher Agent** | Uses Azure OpenAI + Bright Data MCP to search the public web and fill missing contact + company details |
| 3 | **Structured Output Parser** | Ensures AI returns clean JSON in a strict schema |
| 4 | **Lead Scoring Agent** | Calculates a numeric **Fit Score (0–100)** based on ICP match |
| 5 | **IF Logic** | Routes the lead based on Fit Score threshold (&gt; 70 = qualified) |
| 6 | **HubSpot Actions** | Updates/creates Contact & Company with enriched properties |
| 7 | **Slack Notification** | Sends high-quality leads to the team instantly |

### 🧩 Data Enriched by AI
The enrichment agent populates the following fields **only if validated with high confidence**:

#### Contact
- Job title  
- LinkedIn profile  
- Country  

#### Company
- Company name  
- LinkedIn company page  
- Industry  
- Number of employees  
- Annual revenue  
- Description  
- Headquarters (country & city)  
- Funding raised  

If reliable data is not found → field stays `""` (no hallucination, no guessing).

### 🎯 Lead Qualification Strategy
The Fit Score (0–100) evaluates how aligned the lead is with a:
&gt; **B2B automation / AI / RevOps agency targeting SaaS and tech companies**

Score increases for:
- SaaS / tech / B2B service industries
- Mid-size or high-growth teams
- High-responsibility job titles (Founder, COO, Head of Ops, RevOps, CTO)
- Funding raised or traction signals

### 🔔 Resulting CRM + Team Workflow

| Fit Score | CRM Update | Slack Notification |
|----------|------------|--------------------|
| `&gt;` (qualified) | Contact + Company updated | **YES — sales alert sent** |
| `≤ 70` (not qualified) | Contact + Company updated | No notification |

This ensures:
- CRM always stays enriched and structured
- Sales only sees high-potential leads
- No lead is ever dropped or ignored
