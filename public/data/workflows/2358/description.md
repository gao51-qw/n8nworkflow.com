This workflow was presented at the AI Developers meet up in San Fransico on 24 July, 2024. 

### AI workflows
1. Categorize incoming Gmail emails and assign custom Gmail labels. This example uses the Text Classifier node, simplifying this usecase.
2. Ingest a PDF into a Pinecone vector store and chat with it (RAG example)
3. AI Agent example showcasing the HTTP Request tool. We teach the agent how to check availability on a Google Calendar and book an appointment.
