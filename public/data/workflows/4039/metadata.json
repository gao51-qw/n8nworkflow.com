  "description": "**Description:**\nThis n8n workflow helps you capture Slack messages via a webhook and download attached media files (like images, documents, or videos) directly from those messages.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Slack Trigger (Webhook) – Listens for new messages in a Slack channel where the app is added.\n- HTTP Request – Uses the file's private download URL to retrieve the media securely.\n\n**Use cases:**\n- Download files shared by team members in a Slack channel.\n- Capture and process media from specific project or support channels.\n- Prepare media for later processing, archiving, or review.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Slack app with appropriate permissions (files:read, channels:history, etc.).\n- Slack webhook set up to listen to channel messages.\n- - Authenticated HTTP request to handle private Slack file URLs.\n\nThis template is ideal for users who want full control over file handling triggered by real-time Slack messages.",
