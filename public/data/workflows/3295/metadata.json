With AI, you can now have a **Chinese tutor available 24/7** on your phone — no excuses left!\n\nIt is with this spirit that I designed this workflow to support fellow Mandarin learners with a **Chinese Teacher powered by GPT-4o**. \n\n&gt;Boost your **language skills** with AI using N8N!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\nThis workflow template is designed for **language learners** and **educators** who need support to learn a vocabulary list in Mandarin (or any other language) using **Open AI GPT-4o**, an **AI agent** and a **Telegram Bot** to interact with users.\n\n[![Example of Flash Card](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*q3203G-NbZGg1dqHewNgWA.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)\n \n\nFor the vocabulary list, you can use another template shared in my profile [🉑 Generate Anki Flash Cards for Language Learning with Google Translate and GPT-4o](https://n8n.io/workflows/3195-generate-anki-flash-cards-for-language-learning-with-google-translate-and-gpt-4o/) to generate the Google Sheet needed in this workflow.\n\n### How does it work?\nThe workflow loads a **vocabulary list** stored in your **Google Sheet**.\n\n[![Screen of the Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-9.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)\n \n\nThe bot will:\n1. 📥 Load your vocabulary list from Google Sheets\n2. 🧠 Generate multiple-choice questions with GPT-4o\n3. ✅ Evaluate your answer and give instant feedback\n4. 🔁 Loop to the next word until you're fluent\n\n\n[![Example of Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)\n\n\nThese fields will be automatically added to a Google Sheet, ready to be loaded in Anki to create flash cards.\n\n### What do I need to start?\nThis workflow does not require any advanced programming skills.\n#### Prerequisite\n- A **Google Drive Account** with a folder including a Google Sheet filled with the vocabulary list you want to learn.\n- API Credentials: **Open AI API** for the chat model, **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API** activated with OAuth2 credentials\n- A **Telegram Bot** with its token recorded in the Telegram Node Credentials\n- **A Google Sheet** with two columns (initialText: words in your own language, translatedText: words in the target language)\n\n### Next Steps\nFollow the sticky notes to set up the parameters inside each node and get ready to pump your learning skills.\n\n[![Tutorial ScreenShot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/04/Flash-Cards.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)\n\n[🎥 Watch My Tutorial](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)\n\n🚀 Curious how N8N can supercharge learning or supply chain?\n📬 Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n--- \n### Notes\n- This workflow can be used **for any language**. In the AI Agent prompt, you just need to replace Chinese with your language.\n\nThis workflow has been created with N8N 1.82.1\nSubmitted: March 23th, 2025\n",
