### Context
I’m a [**Supply Chain Data Scientist from Paris**](https://samirsaci.com) who lived six years in China — and yes, **learning Mandarin while working full-time was tough**.

[![Mandarin is hard to learn (In Mandarin)](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-24.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)


Learning Mandarin as an adult can be very difficult, especially if you have a full-time job. With AI, you can now have a **Chinese tutor available 24/7** on your phone — no excuses left!

It is with this spirit that I designed this workflow to support fellow Mandarin learners with a **Chinese Teacher powered by GPT-4o**. 

&gt;Boost your **language skills** with AI using N8N!

### Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **language learners** and **educators** who need support to learn a vocabulary list in Mandarin (or any other language) using **Open AI GPT-4o**, an **AI agent** and a **Telegram Bot** to interact with users.

For the vocabulary list, you can use another template shared in my profile [🉑 Generate Anki Flash Cards for Language Learning with Google Translate and GPT-4o](https://n8n.io/workflows/3195-generate-anki-flash-cards-for-language-learning-with-google-translate-and-gpt-4o/) to generate the Google Sheet needed in this workflow.

### How does it work?
The workflow loads a **vocabulary list** stored in your **Google Sheet**.

[![Screen of the Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-9.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)
 

The bot will:
1. 📥 Load your vocabulary list from Google Sheets
2. 🧠 Generate multiple-choice questions with GPT-4o
3. ✅ Evaluate your answer and give instant feedback
4. 🔁 Loop to the next word until you're fluent


[![Example of Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-12.png)](https://youtu.be/MQV8wDSug7M)


These fields will be automatically added to a Google Sheet, ready to be loaded in Anki to create flash cards.

### What do I need to start?
This workflow does not require any advanced programming skills.
#### Prerequisite
- A **Google Drive Account** with a folder including a Google Sheet filled with the vocabulary list you want to learn.
- API Credentials: **Open AI API** for the chat model, **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API** activated with OAuth2 credentials
- A **Telegram Bot** with its token recorded in the Telegram Node Credentials
- **A Google Sheet** with two columns (initialText: words in your own language, translatedText: words in the target language)

### Next Steps
Follow the sticky notes to set up the parameters inside each node and get ready to pump your learning skills.

### Notes
- This workflow can be used **for any language**. In the AI Agent prompt, you just need to replace Chinese with your language.

This workflow has been created with N8N 1.82.1
