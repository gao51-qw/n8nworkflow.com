## How It Works 
***Top Branch Workflow***

**1. The Data Scientist:** 
   - **Ingest:** Pulls historical sales data from Google Sheets.
   - **Math Engine:** Runs 7 statistical algorithms (e.g., Seasonal Naive, Linear Trend, Regression). It backtests them against your history and scientifically selects the winner with the lowest error rate.


**2. The Data Analyst:** 
   - **Interpret:** The AI Agent takes the mathematical output and translates it into business insights, assigning confidence scores based on error margins.
   - **Report:** Generates a visual trend chart (PNG) and sends a complete briefing to your phone.

**3. The Consultant:** AI Agent 2 handles the follow-up questions. It pulls the latest analysis context and checks historical rate data to give an informed answer.
   - **Recall:** When you ask a question via WhatsApp, the bot retrieves the saved forecast state.
   - **Answer:** It acts as an on-demand analyst, comparing current forecasts against historical actuals to give you instant answers.

4) Credentials: Connect Google Sheets, OpenAI, and WhatsApp
