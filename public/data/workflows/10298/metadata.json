  "description": "## **Description**\nThis workflow automates video distribution to 9 social platforms simultaneously using Blotato's API. It includes both a **scheduled publisher** (checks Google Sheets for videos marked \"Ready\") and a **subworkflow** (can be called from other workflows). Perfect for creators and marketers who want to eliminate manual posting across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter, Bluesky, and Pinterest.\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n### **Scheduled Publisher Workflow**\n1. **Schedule Trigger** – Runs daily at 10 PM (configurable).\n2. **Fetch Video** – Pulls video URL and description from Google Sheets where \"ReadyToPost\" = \"Ready\".\n3. **Upload to Blotato** – Sends video to Blotato's media service.\n4. **Broadcast to 9 Platforms** – Publishes simultaneously to all connected social accounts.\n5. **Update Sheet** – Changes \"ReadyToPost\" to \"Finished\" so it won't repost.\n\n---\n\n### **Subworkflow: Video Publisher (Reusable)**\n1. **Receive Input** – Gets URL, title, and description from parent workflow.\n2. **Fetch Credentials** – Pulls Blotato API key from n8n Data Table.\n3. **Upload & Distribute** – Uploads to Blotato, then posts to all platforms.\n4. **Completion Signal** – Returns to parent workflow when done.\n\n&gt; 💡 **Tip:** The subworkflow can be called from ANY workflow - great for posting videos generated by AI workflows, webhook triggers, or manual forms.\n\n---\n\n### **Test Workflow (Optional)**\n1. **Form Submission** – Upload a video file with title and description.\n2. **Upload to Dropbox** – Generates shareable URL via \"[SUB] Dropbox Upload Link\" subworkflow.\n3. **Trigger Publisher** – Calls the subworkflow above to distribute the video.\n\n---\n\n## **Setup Instructions**\n\n**Estimated Setup Time:** 20-25 minutes\n\n### **Step 1: Blotato Account Setup**\n1. Create account at [Blotato Dashboard](https://my.blotato.com/)\n2. Connect all your social media accounts (most time-consuming step)\n3. Go to [Settings](https://my.blotato.com/settings) and copy your account IDs for each platform\n4. Go to [API Settings](https://my.blotato.com/settings/api) and copy your API key\n\n### **Step 2: Configure Workflow**\n1. **Update Social IDs:**\n   - Open \"Assign Social Media IDs\" node\n   - Replace placeholder IDs with your actual Blotato account IDs:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"instagram_id\": \"YOUR_ID\",\n       \"youtube_id\": \"YOUR_ID\",\n       \"tiktok_id\": \"YOUR_ID\",\n       ...\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Create Data Table:**\n   - Create n8n Data Table named **\"Credentials\"**\n   - Add columns: `service` and `token`\n   - Add row: service = `blotato`, token = `YOUR_API_KEY`\n\n3. **Set Up Google Sheet:**\n   - Create sheet with columns: `URL VIDEO`, `ReadyToPost`, `Description`, `Titre` (Title)\n   - Add video data\n   - Set `ReadyToPost` to \"Ready\" for videos you want to post\n\n4. **Connect Your Sheet:**\n   - Update \"Get my video\" node with your Google Sheet ID\n\n&gt; ⚙️ **Pro Tip:** If you don't need the scheduled version, just use the subworkflow and call it from other workflows.\n\n---\n\n## **Use Cases**\n\n- **AI Video Workflows:** Automatically post videos generated by Veo, Sora, or other AI models to all platforms.\n- **Content Schedulers:** Queue videos in Google Sheets, let the scheduler post them automatically.\n- **Batch Publishing:** Generate 10 videos, mark them all \"Ready\", and let the workflow distribute them.\n- **Marketing Campaigns:** Coordinate multi-platform launches with a single click.\n- **Agencies:** Manage multiple client accounts by swapping Blotato credentials in the Data Table.\n\n---\n\n## **Customization Options**\n\n- **Remove Unused Platforms:** Disconnect any social media nodes you don't use (speeds up execution).\n- **Change Schedule:** Modify the Schedule Trigger to run multiple times per day or on specific days.\n- **Different File Hosts:** Replace Dropbox with Google Drive, S3, or Cloudinary in the test workflow.\n- **Platform-Specific Captions:** Add IF nodes before each platform to customize descriptions or add hashtags.\n- **Add Approval Step:** Insert a WhatsApp or Telegram notification before posting for manual review.\n- **Watermarks:** Add a Code node to overlay branding before uploading to Blotato.\n\n---\n\n## **Important Notes**\n\n⚠️ **Two Workflows in One File:**\n- Lines 1-600: Scheduled publisher (checks Google Sheets)\n- Lines 600+: Subworkflow (called by other workflows)\n\n⚠️ **Data Table vs. Hardcoding:**\n- Scheduled workflow: Hardcoded API keys in HTTP nodes\n- Subworkflow: Uses Data Table for API keys (recommended approach)\n\n⚠️ **Why Use the Subworkflow?**\n- Can be called from ANY workflow\n- Easier to manage API keys (one place to update)\n- More flexible for complex automation systems",
