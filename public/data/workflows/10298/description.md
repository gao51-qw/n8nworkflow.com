## **Description**
This workflow automates video distribution to 9 social platforms simultaneously using Blotato's API. It includes both a **scheduled publisher** (checks Google Sheets for videos marked "Ready") and a **subworkflow** (can be called from other workflows). Perfect for creators and marketers who want to eliminate manual posting across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter, Bluesky, and Pinterest.

## **How It Works**

### **Scheduled Publisher Workflow**
1. **Schedule Trigger** – Runs daily at 10 PM (configurable).
2. **Fetch Video** – Pulls video URL and description from Google Sheets where "ReadyToPost" = "Ready".
3. **Upload to Blotato** – Sends video to Blotato's media service.
4. **Broadcast to 9 Platforms** – Publishes simultaneously to all connected social accounts.
5. **Update Sheet** – Changes "ReadyToPost" to "Finished" so it won't repost.

---

### **Subworkflow: Video Publisher (Reusable)**
1. **Receive Input** – Gets URL, title, and description from parent workflow.
2. **Fetch Credentials** – Pulls Blotato API key from n8n Data Table.
3. **Upload & Distribute** – Uploads to Blotato, then posts to all platforms.
4. **Completion Signal** – Returns to parent workflow when done.

&gt; 💡 **Tip:** The subworkflow can be called from ANY workflow - great for posting videos generated by AI workflows, webhook triggers, or manual forms.

### **Test Workflow (Optional)**
1. **Form Submission** – Upload a video file with title and description.
2. **Upload to Dropbox** – Generates shareable URL via "[SUB] Dropbox Upload Link" subworkflow.
3. **Trigger Publisher** – Calls the subworkflow above to distribute the video.

## **Setup Instructions**

**Estimated Setup Time:** 20-25 minutes

### **Step 1: Blotato Account Setup**
1. Create account at [Blotato Dashboard](https://my.blotato.com/)
2. Connect all your social media accounts (most time-consuming step)
3. Go to [Settings](https://my.blotato.com/settings) and copy your account IDs for each platform
4. Go to [API Settings](https://my.blotato.com/settings/api) and copy your API key

### **Step 2: Configure Workflow**
1. **Update Social IDs:**
   - Open "Assign Social Media IDs" node
   - Replace placeholder IDs with your actual Blotato account IDs:
     ```json
     {
       "instagram_id": "YOUR_ID",
       "youtube_id": "YOUR_ID",
       "tiktok_id": "YOUR_ID",
       ...
     }
     ```

2. **Create Data Table:**
   - Create n8n Data Table named **"Credentials"**
   - Add columns: `service` and `token`
   - Add row: service = `blotato`, token = `YOUR_API_KEY`

3. **Set Up Google Sheet:**
   - Create sheet with columns: `URL VIDEO`, `ReadyToPost`, `Description`, `Titre` (Title)
   - Add video data
   - Set `ReadyToPost` to "Ready" for videos you want to post

4. **Connect Your Sheet:**
   - Update "Get my video" node with your Google Sheet ID

&gt; ⚙️ **Pro Tip:** If you don't need the scheduled version, just use the subworkflow and call it from other workflows.

## **Use Cases**

- **AI Video Workflows:** Automatically post videos generated by Veo, Sora, or other AI models to all platforms.
- **Content Schedulers:** Queue videos in Google Sheets, let the scheduler post them automatically.
- **Batch Publishing:** Generate 10 videos, mark them all "Ready", and let the workflow distribute them.
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Coordinate multi-platform launches with a single click.
- **Agencies:** Manage multiple client accounts by swapping Blotato credentials in the Data Table.

---

## **Customization Options**

- **Remove Unused Platforms:** Disconnect any social media nodes you don't use (speeds up execution).
- **Change Schedule:** Modify the Schedule Trigger to run multiple times per day or on specific days.
- **Different File Hosts:** Replace Dropbox with Google Drive, S3, or Cloudinary in the test workflow.
- **Platform-Specific Captions:** Add IF nodes before each platform to customize descriptions or add hashtags.
- **Add Approval Step:** Insert a WhatsApp or Telegram notification before posting for manual review.
- **Watermarks:** Add a Code node to overlay branding before uploading to Blotato.

## **Important Notes**

⚠️ **Two Workflows in One File:**
- Lines 1-600: Scheduled publisher (checks Google Sheets)
- Lines 600+: Subworkflow (called by other workflows)

⚠️ **Data Table vs. Hardcoding:**
- Scheduled workflow: Hardcoded API keys in HTTP nodes
- Subworkflow: Uses Data Table for API keys (recommended approach)

⚠️ **Why Use the Subworkflow?**
- Can be called from ANY workflow
- Easier to manage API keys (one place to update)
- More flexible for complex automation systems
