  "description": "This will send your Github notifications to a discord webhook.\n\nSince **Github doesn't send push notifications to mobile devices** other then **@mention** this is a great workaround to receive notifications on Discord with this.\n\nUsing a github trigger was not a good option as there is no trigger for notifications only events (which don't work on org repos). Using http request on notifications api is way better.\n\n++TAGGING USER IN MESSATGE:++\nChange **<@userIdForTagging>** with your discord Id to get tagged when sending notifications. To find your own id type in any channel backslash followed by your username with the 4 digit hash code\n\nYou can copy this by clicking on your username next to your profile picture \n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\n\\@username#9999\n```\n\n*Enjoy!*",
