# n8n Workflow: Invoice PDF Generator

This n8n workflow captures invoice data and generates a PDF invoice, ready to be sent or saved. It uses a webhook to trigger the process, preprocesses the invoice data, and converts it to a PDF using HTML and custom styling.

[@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit](@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit)

## Features:

- **Webhook Trigger**: Receives incoming data, including invoice details.
- **Preprocessing**: Transforms the invoice data into HTML format.
- **HTML to PDF Conversion**: Converts the preprocessed HTML into a styled PDF document.
- **Response**: Sends the generated PDF back to the webhook response.

# Notice

Community nodes can only be installed on self-hosted instances of n8n.

## Requirements

- **Self-hosted** n8n instance
- A **CustomJS API key** for website screenshots.
- **Invoice data** for PDF generation

## Workflow Steps:

1. **Webhook Trigger**:

   - Accepts incoming data (e.g., invoice number, recipient details, itemized list).
   - This data is passed to the next node for processing.

2. **Set Data Node**:

   - Configures initial values for the invoice, including the recipient, sender, invoice number, and the items on the invoice.
   - The invoice details include information like description, unit price, and quantity.

3. **Preprocess Node**:

   - Processes the raw data to format it correctly for HTML. This includes splitting addresses and converting the items into an HTML table format.

4. **HTML to PDF Conversion**:

   - Converts the generated HTML into a PDF document. The HTML includes a header, a detailed invoice table, and a footer with contact information.

5. **Respond to Webhook**:
   - Returns the generated PDF as a response to the initial webhook request.

### 2. Design Workflow

1. **Create a Webhook**:

   - Set up a webhook to trigger the workflow when invoice data is received.

2. **Prepare Data**:

   - Ensure the incoming request contains fields like "Invoice No", "Bill To", "From", and "Details" (list of items with price and quantity).

3. **Customize the HTML**:

   - The HTML template for the invoice includes custom styling to give the invoice a professional look.

4. **Convert to PDF**:
   - The **HTML to PDF** node is configured with the data generated from the preprocessing step to convert the invoice HTML to a PDF format.
