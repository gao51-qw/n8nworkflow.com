  "description": "## Who's it for  \nContent creators, SEO specialists, and marketing teams who want to automatically generate SEO-optimized content based on trending topics—complete with AI-generated images, optional videos, and ready-to-publish HTML.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Webhook** receives a request with use case and video preferences.  \n2. **Get Trends XLSX** downloads a spreadsheet (created by the Social Media Trends workflow) from SharePoint.  \n3. **Select Topic from Trends** randomly picks one trending topic from the spreadsheet.  \n4. **AI Agent** (GPT-4o) generates bilingual newsletter content about the selected trend.  \n5. **Get Newsletter Template** fetches your HTML template; **Build Newsletter** injects the AI content.  \n6. Optional creative assets:  \n   • **Pollinations AI** → generates a 1080 × 1350 image.  \n   • **FAL AI** → creates video from the image + Lyria2 audio → merged via FFmpeg.  \n7. **Gmail Approval** sends the draft for review; continues only on approval.  \n8. **Upload** all files (HTML + JPG + video URL) to your chosen storage provider.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import the template into n8n (cloud or self-hosted).  \n2. Create credentials: OpenAI, Microsoft 365 (SharePoint), Gmail, and FAL AI.  \n3. Upload your HTML newsletter template to SharePoint (see yellow sticky note for required placeholders).  \n4. Ensure you have a trends spreadsheet (from the Social Media Trends workflow) in your SharePoint folder.  \n5. Update **Configuration Settings** with your `ENV_*` variables.  \n6. Activate the workflow and POST to the webhook: `{ \"text\": \"usecase: blog post, include_video: true\" }`.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- OpenAI account \n- Microsoft 365 tenant (SharePoint)  \n- Gmail account  \n- FAL AI API Key (for video generation)  \n- A trends spreadsheet (from the Social Media Trends workflow)\n\n## How to customize  \n- Change storage provider: replace SharePoint upload nodes with Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3.  \n- Modify topic selection: edit **Select Topic from Trends** for different selection logic.  \n- Adjust content tone: tweak the prompt in **Prepare Newsletter Data**.  \n- Skip video generation: set `include_video: false` in the webhook request.",
