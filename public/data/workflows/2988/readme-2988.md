# Get daily exercise plan with Flex Message via LINE

> The YogiAI workflow automates sending daily yoga pose reminders and related information via Line Push Messages . This automation leverages data from a Google Sheets database containing yoga pose details such as names, image URLs, and links to ensure users receive personalized and engaging content every day.

**Purpose**
- Provide users with daily yoga pose suggestions tailored to their practice.
- Deliver visually appealing and informative content through Line's Flex Messages, including images and clickable links.
- Log user interactions and preferences back into Google Sheets to refine future recommendations.

**Key Features**
1. Automated Daily Reminders : Sends a curated list of yoga poses at a scheduled time (21:30 Bangkok time).
2. Dynamic Content Generation : Uses AI to rewrite and format messages in a user-friendly manner, complete with emojis and clear instructions.
3. Integration with Google Sheets : Pulls data from a predefined Google Sheet and logs interactions for continuous improvement.
4. Customizable Messaging : Ensures JSON outputs are properly formatted for Line’s Flex Message API, allowing for interactive and visually rich content.


**Data Source**
Google Sheets Structure
The workflow relies on a Google Sheet structured as follows:

PoseName : The name of the yoga pose.
uri : The image URL representing the pose.
url : A clickable link directing users to more information about the pose.
