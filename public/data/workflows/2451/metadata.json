  "description": "\nThis workflow downloads all files from a specific folder in a S3 Bucket and compresses them so you can download it via n8n or do further processings.\n\nFill in your **Credentials and Settings** in the Nodes marked with _\"*\"_.\n\nMight serve well as Blueprint or as manual Download for S3 Folders. \n\nSince I found it rather tricky to compress all binary files into one zip file I figured might it be an interesting Template. \n\n**Hint:**\nThis is the expression to get every binary key to compress them dynamically. \n```{{ Object.keys($binary).join(',') }}```\n(used in the \"Compress\"-Node)\n\n![Image](https://cloud.let-the-work-flow.com/logo-64.png)\nEnjoy the Workflow! ❤️ \nhttps://let-the-work-flow.com\nWorkflow Automation & Development",
