The flow is triggered when a user uploads an image through a form. The image is sent to the API  [**Background Remover AI**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/background-remover-ai3), where it undergoes automatic background removal. Upon successful processing, the new image is uploaded to a temporary file storage service using the [**Temp File Upload**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/temp-file-upload). Afterward, the relevant data, including the image link and status, is logged in a **Google Sheets** document for easy access and tracking.\n\nIn case the process fails, the system automatically logs a failure status in the same Google Sheet, along with the reason (if applicable). This allows users to have a transparent, organized, and real-time view of both successful and failed background removal attempts.\n\n### **Used APIs:**\n1. [**Background Remover AI**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/background-remover-ai3): An AI-powered service that removes backgrounds from images.

The table will have the following columns:\n\n| **Image Name**  | **Link** | **Status** | **Expire At**       |\n|-----------------|----------|------------|---------------------|\n| `image1.jpg`    | [Link](#) | Success    | 2025-07-25T12:00:00Z |\n| `image2.jpg`    | [Link](#) | Success    | 2025-07-25T12:00:00Z |\n| `image3.jpg`    | Not found | Failed     | 2025-07-24T12:00:00Z |\n| `image4.jpg`    | [Link](#) | Success    | 2025-07-25T12:00:00Z |\n\n### **Columns Explained:**\n- **Image Name**: The name of the image file uploaded by the user.\n- **Link**: A direct link to the processed image stored in temporary file storage.\n- **Status**: Indicates whether the background removal was **Successful** or **Failed**.\n- **Expire At**: The expiration date and time when the temporary file link will no longer be accessible.\n\nThis table provides real-time tracking of each image processing event, offering full visibility of the workflow results.
