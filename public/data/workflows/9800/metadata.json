  "description": "## Generate Invoices and Send Reminders for Customers with Jotform and Xero\nThis workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **Xero**, generating an invoice, emailing it — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**), and sending invoice reminders.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Receive Submission**\n- Triggered when a user submits a form.\n- Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.\n\n2. **Create/Update The Customer**\n- Creates/Updates the customer.\n\n3. **Create The Invoice**\n- Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.\n\n4. **Send The Invoice**\n- Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.\n\n5. **Store The Invoice In DB**\n- Stores the needed invoice details in the DB.\n\n6. **Send Reminders**\n- Every day at 8 AM, the automation checks each invoice to decide whether to:\n    * send a reminder email,\n    * skip and send it later, or\n    * delete the invoice from the DB (if it's paid or all reminders have been sent).\n\n## Who Can Benefit from This Workflow?\n* **Freelancers**\n* **Service Providers**\n* **Consultants & Coaches**\n* **Small Businesses**\n* **E-commerce or Custom Product Sellers**\n\n## Requirements\n- Jotform webhook setup, more info [here](https://www.jotform.com/help/245-how-to-setup-a-webhook-with-jotform/)\n- Xero credentials, more info [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/xero)\n- Make sure that products/services values in Jotform are exactly the same as your item `Code` in your Xero account\n- Email setup, update email nodes (`Send email` & `Send reminder email` & `Send reminders sent summary`)\n- Create data table with the following columns:\n    * invoiceId (string)\n    * remainingAmount (number)\n    * currency (string)\n    * remindersSent (number)\n    * lastSentAt (date time)\n- Update `Add reminders config` node so update the data table id and intervals in days (default is after 2 days, then after 3 days and finally after 5 days )\n- LLM model credentials",
