## Generate Invoices and Send Reminders for Customers with Jotform and Xero
This workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **Xero**, generating an invoice, emailing it — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**), and sending invoice reminders.

## How It Works
1. **Receive Submission**
- Triggered when a user submits a form.
- Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.

2. **Create/Update The Customer**
- Creates/Updates the customer.

3. **Create The Invoice**
- Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.

4. **Send The Invoice**
- Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.

5. **Store The Invoice In DB**
- Stores the needed invoice details in the DB.

6. **Send Reminders**
- Every day at 8 AM, the automation checks each invoice to decide whether to:
    * send a reminder email,
    * skip and send it later, or
    * delete the invoice from the DB (if it's paid or all reminders have been sent).

## Who Can Benefit from This Workflow?
* **Freelancers**
* **Service Providers**
* **Consultants & Coaches**
* **Small Businesses**
* **E-commerce or Custom Product Sellers**
