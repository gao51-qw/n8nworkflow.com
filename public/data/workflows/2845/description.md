The provided workflow in n8n is designed to create a Business WhatsApp AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot.

---

### How it works:
1. **Webhook Setup**: The workflow begins by setting up webhooks for verification and response. The *Verify* webhook receives GET requests and sends back a verification code, while the *Respond* webhook handles incoming POST requests from Meta regarding WhatsApp messages.
2. **Message Handling**: Once a message is received, the workflow checks if the incoming JSON contains a user message. If it does, the message is processed further; otherwise, a generic response is sent.
3. **AI Agent Interaction**: The user's message is passed to the AI Agent node, which uses a conversational agent with a predefined system message tailored for an electronics store. This ensures that the AI provides accurate and professional responses based on the knowledge base.
4. **Knowledge Base Utilization**: The AI Agent references a knowledge base stored in Qdrant, a vector database. Documents from Google Drive are downloaded, vectorized using OpenAI embeddings, and stored in Qdrant for retrieval during conversations.
5. **Response Generation**: The AI Agent generates a response using the OpenAI chat model (gpt-4o-mini) and sends it back to the user via WhatsApp.

### Set up steps:
1. **Create Qdrant Collection**:
   - Update the `QDRANTURL` and `COLLECTION` variables in the workflow.
   - Use the *Create collection* HTTP request node to initialize the collection in Qdrant.

2. **Vectorize Documents**:
   - Configure the *Get folder* and *Download Files* nodes to fetch documents from a specified Google Drive folder.
   - Use the *Embeddings OpenAI* node to generate embeddings for the downloaded files.
   - Store the vectorized documents in Qdrant using the *Qdrant Vector Store* node.

3. **Configure Webhooks**:
   - Ensure both *Verify* and *Respond* webhooks have the same URL.
   - Set the *Verify* webhook to use the GET HTTP method and the *Respond* webhook to use the POST HTTP method.

4. **Set Up AI Agent**:
   - Define the system prompt for the AI Agent, specifying guidelines for product information, technical support, customer service, and knowledge base usage.
   - Link the AI Agent to the OpenAI chat model and configure any additional tools as needed.

5. **Test Workflow**:
   - Trigger the workflow manually using the *When clicking ‘Test workflow’* node to ensure all components are functioning correctly.
   - Monitor the flow of data through the nodes and verify that responses are being generated and sent accurately.

By following these steps, the workflow will be fully operational, enabling a robust AI-powered chatbot capable of handling customer inquiries via WhatsApp.
