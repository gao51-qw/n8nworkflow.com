The workflow also cleans the HTML content to extract readable text.\nDocument Creation: Creates a new Google Docs document in a specified folder with a timestamp and idea name in the title format.\nContent Aggregation: Systematically visits each insight page (main idea page, value ladder, why now, proof signals, market gap, execution plan, value equation, value matrix, ACP, community signals, and keywords) and collects their content.\nDocument Population: Processes the collected content through markdown formatting and appends it to the Google Docs document, creating a comprehensive report of the daily business idea with all its associated insights.\nAutomated Scheduling: Runs automatically every day at 8 AM, ensuring you have fresh business idea analysis delivered to your Google Drive without manual intervention.\nThis automation is perfect for entrepreneurs, business analysts, or anyone who wants to stay updated with curated business ideas and their detailed market analysis in an organized, searchable format.",
