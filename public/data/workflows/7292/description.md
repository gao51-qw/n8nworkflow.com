# Automated Helpdesk Ticket Alerts to Microsoft Teams from Easy Redmine

## Intro/Overview
This workflow automatically posts a Microsoft Teams message whenever a new helpdesk ticket is created in Easy Redmine. It’s perfect for IT teams who want real-time visibility into new issues without constantly checking ticket queues or inboxes. By integrating Easy Redmine with Teams, this setup ensures tickets are discussed and resolved faster, improving both response and resolution times.

## How it works

1. **Catch Easy Webhook – New Issue Created**  
   - Triggers whenever Easy Redmine sends a webhook for a newly created ticket.  
   - Uses the webhook URL generated from Easy Redmine’s webhook settings.

2. **Get a new ticket by ID**  
   - Fetches full ticket details (subject, priority, description) via the Easy Redmine API using the ticket ID from the webhook payload.

3. **Pick Description & Create URL to Issue**  
   - Extracts the ticket description.  
   - Builds a direct link to the ticket in Easy Redmine for quick access.

4. **AI Agent – Description Processing**  
   - Uses an AI model to summarize the ticket and suggest possible solutions based on the issue description.

5. **MS Teams Message to Support Channel**  
   - Formats and sends the ticket details, priority, summary, and issue link into a designated Microsoft Teams channel.  
   - Uses the Teams message layout for clarity and quick scanning.

   - In the “Get a new ticket by ID” node, insert your API endpoint and authentication.

## Customization

- Change the AI prompt to adjust how summaries and solutions are generated.

- Add filters so only high-priority or specific project tickets trigger notifications.
- Send alerts to multiple Teams channels based on ticket type or project.

**Workflow Improvement Suggestions:**  
- Rename nodes for clarity (e.g., “Fetch Ticket Details” instead of “get-one-issue”).  
- Ensure no private ticket data is exposed beyond intended recipients.  
- Add error handling for failed API calls to avoid missing ticket alerts.
