  "description": "# 💰 Package Recommender with Sales Pipeline Tracking\n\n## What It Does\nAutomatically recommends the right service package based on budget, sends beautifully formatted proposal emails with case studies, logs everything to a sales pipeline tracker, and schedules your follow-up reminders. Converts inquiries into booked calls without manual proposal writing.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Form Trigger** → Lead submits budget and challenge details\n2. **Log to Pipeline** → All inquiry data saved to tracking sheet\n3. **Budget Router** → Directs to Basic ($0-3K), Standard ($3-6K), or Premium ($6K+)\n4. **Set Package Variables** → Loads appropriate features, pricing, case study\n5. **Send Proposal Email** → Gorgeous HTML email with personalized package details\n6. **Update Pipeline** → Marks \"Package Sent\" and sets follow-up date (+3 days)\n7. **Calendar Reminder** → Creates event in 3 days reminding you to follow up\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Step 1: Create Sales Pipeline Sheet\n- Create Google Sheet with tab \"Package Inquiries\"\n- Add columns: `Timestamp | Name | Email | Phone | Budget | Timeline | Challenge | Package Recommended | Package Price | Status | Date Sent | Follow-Up Date`\n- Update `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in nodes 2, 7, and calendar description\n\n### Step 2: Customize Package Details\n- Edit nodes 4, 5, 6 (Set Package Details nodes)\n- Update pricing, features, and case studies for your services\n- Replace booking links with your actual Calendly/scheduling URLs\n- Adjust package names if needed\n\n### Step 3: Configure Email Template\n- Edit node 7 email design/branding\n- Update \"Your Name\" and signature\n- Customize colors (currently: purple gradient, green CTA)\n- Test email rendering across devices\n\n### Step 4: Setup Calendar Integration\n- Add Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials\n- Verify follow-up timing (currently +3 days)\n- Customize reminder description with your workflow\n- Update Google Sheet link in calendar event",
