  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis workflow automates weather forecast delivery by collecting city names, fetching 5-day forecasts from OpenWeatherMap, and generating professionally formatted HTML emails using GPT-4. The AI creates condition-based color-coded reports with safety precautions and sends them via Gmail.\n\n## How It Works\n\nA form trigger collects up to three city names, which are geocoded via OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve coordinates and 5-day forecasts. \n\nJavaScript nodes process the raw weather data into daily summaries, calculating temperature ranges, precipitation levels, wind speeds, and dominant weather conditions. \n\nGPT-4 then generates professionally formatted HTML emails with condition-based color coding: The AI intelligently adds contextual safety warnings for heavy rain, extreme heat, high winds, and thunderstorms. \n\nA validation node ensures proper JSON formatting before Gmail sends the final briefing.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n• Field ops & construction crew briefings\n• Travel planning and itinerary preparation\n• Outdoor event planning & coordination\n• Logistics and transportation route planning\n• Real estate property viewing scheduling\n• Sports and recreational activity planning\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n1) OpenWeatherMap API credentials\n2) OpenAI API key\n3) Gmail OAuth2 authentication\n\n## Need Help?\n\nJoin the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XPKeKXeB7d) or ask in the [Forum](https://community.n8n.io/)!\nREADME file available at https://tinyurl.com/MulticityWeatherForecast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
