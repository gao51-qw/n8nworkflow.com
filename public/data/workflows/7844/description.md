## Short Description

This LinkedIn automation workflow monitors post comments for specific trigger words and automatically sends direct messages with lead magnets to engaged users. The system checks connection status, handles non-connected users with connection requests, and prevents duplicate outreach by tracking all interactions in a database.

## Key Features

- **Comment Monitoring**: Scans LinkedIn post comments for customizable trigger words
- **Connection Status Check**: Determines if users are 1st-degree connections
- **Automated DMs**: Sends personalized messages with lead magnet links to connected users
- **Connection Requests**: Asks non-connected users to connect via comment replies
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks interactions in NocoDB to avoid repeat messages
- **Message Rotation**: Uses different comment reply variations for authenticity
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple comments with built-in delays

## Who This Workflow Is For
