  "description": "## Who's it for\n\nThis template is perfect for community managers, business owners, and WhatsApp group administrators who want to create a welcoming experience for new members. Whether you're running a support group, managing a business community, or moderating a hobby group, this automation ensures every new member feels valued from the moment they join.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe workflow automatically detects when someone joins your WhatsApp group and sends them a personalized welcome message directly to their private chat. It uses Evolution API to interface with WhatsApp Business and includes a natural delay to make the interaction feel more human. The entire process is hands-off once configured, ensuring consistent engagement with new members 24/7.\n\n## What it does\n\n1. **Monitors group activity** - Receives real-time notifications when members join or leave\n2. **Filters for your specific group** - Ensures messages are only sent for your designated group\n3. **Validates new joins** - Confirms the event is a member joining (not leaving)\n4. **Adds natural timing** - Waits a customizable period before sending the message\n5. **Sends private welcome** - Delivers your welcome message directly to the new member's chat\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Evolution API instance** (self-hosted or cloud service)\n- **WhatsApp Business account** connected to Evolution API\n- **Group admin permissions** for the WhatsApp group\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Import the workflow** into your n8n instance\n2. **Configure the Set Variables node** with:\n   - Your WhatsApp group ID (format: xxxxxxxxxxxxx@g.us)\n   - Evolution API key\n   - Instance name from Evolution API\n   - Evolution API URL\n   - Custom welcome message\n   - Delay time in minutes\n\n3. **Copy the webhook URL** from the Webhook node\n4. **Configure Evolution API** to send group notifications to your webhook URL\n5. **Test the workflow** by having someone join your group\n6. **Activate the workflow** for continuous operation\n\nFor a detailed video tutorial on setting up this workflow, check out: https://youtu.be/WO2MJoQqLvo\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Welcome message**: Edit the message in the Set Variables node to match your group's tone\n- **Timing**: Adjust the wait time to send messages immediately or after several minutes\n- **Multiple groups**: Duplicate the workflow and change the group ID for each group\n- **Rich media**: Extend the HTTP Request node to send images or documents with the welcome\n- **Conditional messages**: Add IF nodes to send different messages based on time of day or member count\n- **Follow-up sequence**: Chain additional HTTP Request nodes to create a welcome series",
