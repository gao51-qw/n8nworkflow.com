This workflow automates competitor keyword research using OpenAI LLM and Decodo for intelligent web scraping.

## Who this is for

* SEO specialists, content strategists, and growth marketers who want to automate keyword research and competitive intelligence.

* Marketing analysts managing multiple clients or websites who need consistent SEO tracking without manual data pulls.

* Agencies or automation engineers using Google Sheets as an SEO data dashboard for keyword monitoring and reporting.


## What problem this workflow solves

Tracking competitor keywords manually is slow and inconsistent.

Most SEO tools provide limited API access or lack contextual keyword analysis.

This workflow solves that by:

* Automatically scraping any competitor’s webpage with Decodo.
* Using OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to interpret keyword intent, density, and semantic focus.
* Storing structured keyword insights directly in Google Sheets for ongoing tracking and trend analysis.

## What this workflow does

1. **Trigger** — Manually start the workflow or schedule it to run periodically.
2. **Input Setup** — Define the website URL and target country (e.g., `https://dev.to`, `france`).
3. **Data Scraping (Decodo)** — Fetch competitor web content and metadata.
4. **Keyword Analysis (OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini)** 

   * Extract primary and secondary keywords.
   * Identify focus topics and semantic entities.
   * Generate a keyword density summary and SEO strength score.
   * Recommend optimization and internal linking opportunities.
5. **Data Structuring** — Clean and convert GPT output into JSON format.
6. **Data Storage (Google Sheets)** — Append structured keyword data to a Google Sheet for long-term tracking.
