  "description": "## Company Website Chatbot Agent\n\n#### Overview\nThis workflow implements a modular **Website AI Chatbot Assistant** capable of handling multiple types of customer interactions autonomously. Instead of relying on a single large agent to handle all logic and tools, this system routes user queries to specialized sub-agents—each dedicated to a specific function.\n\nBy using a manager-style orchestration layer, this approach prevents overloading a single AI model with excessive context, leading to cleaner routing, faster execution, and easier scaling as your automation needs grow.\n\n---\n\n#### How It Works\n\n**1. Chat Trigger**  \n- The flow is initiated when a chat message is received via the website widget.\n\n**2. Manager Agent (Ultimate Website AI Assistant)**  \n- The central LLM-based agent is responsible for parsing the message and deciding which specialized sub-agent to route it to.\n- It uses an OpenAI GPT model for natural language understanding and a lightweight memory system to preserve recent context.\n\n**3. Sub-Agent Routing**  \n- `calendarAgent`: Handles availability checks and books meetings on connected calendars.  \n- `RAGAgent`: Searches company documentation or FAQs to provide accurate responses from your internal knowledge base.  \n- `ticketAgent`: Forwards requests to human support by generating and sending support tickets to a designated email.\n\n---\n\n#### Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Embed the Chatbot**  \n   - Use a custom HTML widget or script to embed the chatbot interface on your website.  \n   - Connect the frontend to the webhook that triggers the `When chat message received` node.\n\n2. **Configure Your OpenAI Key**  \n   - Insert your API key in the `OpenAI Chat Model` node.  \n   - Adjust the model parameters for temperature, max tokens, etc., based on how formal or creative you want the bot to be.\n\n3. **Customize Sub-Agents**  \n   - `calendarAgent`: Connect to your Google or Outlook calendar.  \n   - `RAGAgent`: Link to a vector store or document database via API or native integration.  \n   - `ticketAgent`: Set the destination email and format for ticket generation (e.g. via SendGrid or SMTP).\n\n4. **Deploy in Production**  \n   - Host on n8n Cloud or your self-hosted instance.  \n   - Monitor usage through the Executions tab and refine prompts based on user behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### Benefits\n\n- Modular system with dedicated logic per function  \n- Reduces token bloat by offloading complexity to sub-agents  \n- Easy to scale by adding more tools (e.g. CRM, analytics)  \n- Fast and responsive user experience for customers on your site  \n- Cleaner code structure and easier debugging\n",
