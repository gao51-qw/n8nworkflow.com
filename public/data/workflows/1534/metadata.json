It uses the public api to export all of the workflow data using the n8n node.\n\nIt then loops over the data checks in Github to see if a file exists that uses the workflow name. Once checked it will then update the file on Github if it exists, Create a new file if it doesn't exist and if it's the same it will ignore the file.\n\n### Config Options\n**repo_owner** - Github owner\n\n**repo_name** - Github repository name\n\n**repo_path** - Path within the Github repository\n\n&gt;This workflow has been updated to use the n8n node and the code node so requires at least version 0.198.0 of n8n",
