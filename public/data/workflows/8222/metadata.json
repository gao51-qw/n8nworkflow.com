  "description": "\n\n###  How It Works\n\n1. **Story Generation** – Your idea is transformed into a narrative split into scenes using **DeepSeek LLM**.  \n2. **Visuals** – Each scene is illustrated with AI images via **Replicate**, then animated into cinematic video clips with **RunwayML**.  \n3. **Voice & Music** – Narration is created using **ElevenLabs** (text-to-speech), while **Replicate audio models** generate background music.  \n4. **Final Assembly** – All assets are merged into a professional video using **Creatomate**.  \n5. **Delivery** – Everything is orchestrated by **n8n**, triggered from Slack with `/render`, and the final video link is delivered back instantly.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow in Action\n\n#### 1. Trigger from Slack\nType your idea with `/render` in Slack - the workflow starts automatically.  \n![Slack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/n8n-automated-storytelling/refs/heads/main/SLACK.png)\n\n#### 2. Final Video Output\nReceive a polished cinematic video link in Slack.  \n![Final Render](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/n8n-automated-storytelling/refs/heads/main/creatomate-vd.png)\n\n#### 3. Creatomate Template\n⚠️ **Important:** You must create your own template in **Creatomate**.  \n\nThis is a **one-time setup** - the template defines where the voiceover, music, and video clips will be placed.  \nThe more detailed and refined your template is, the better the final cinematic result.  \n![Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/n8n-automated-storytelling/refs/heads/main/template.png)\n\n---\n\n### Required APIs\n\nTo run this workflow, you need accounts and API keys from the following services:\n\n- [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com) – Story generation (LLM)  \n- [Replicate](https://replicate.com) – Images & AI music generation  \n- [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com) – Image-to-video animations  \n- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) – Text-to-speech voiceovers  \n- [Creatomate](https://creatomate.com) – Video rendering and templates  \n- [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) – File storage and asset syncing  \n- [Slack](https://slack.com) – Workflow trigger and video delivery  \n\n---\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1. Import the JSON workflow into your **n8n** instance.  \n2. Add your API credentials for each service above.  \n3. Create a **Creatomate template** (only once) – define layers for visuals, voice, and music.  \n4. Trigger the workflow from Slack with `/render Your Story Idea`.  \n5. Receive your final cinematic video link directly in Slack.  \n\n---\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Automated **YouTube Shorts / TikToks** for faceless content creators.  \n- Scalable **ad creatives** and marketing videos for agencies.  \n- **Educational explainers** and onboarding videos generated from text.  \n- **Rapid prototyping** of cinematic ideas for developers & storytellers.  \n\n---\n\nWith this workflow, you’re not just using AI tools – you’re running a **full AI-powered studio in n8n**.
