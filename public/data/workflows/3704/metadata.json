  "description": "### 🔐 PIX QR Code Generator for Any Bank and Key – Powered by n8n\n\nEasily generate PIX QR Codes with this ready-to-use n8n workflow, supporting **any valid PIX key** (CPF, CNPJ, phone, email, or random key) and following the official **BACEN** standard — the Central Bank of Brazil's regulation.\n\nWhether you want to automate payments in chatbots, CRM systems, e-commerce checkouts, or custom apps, this solution provides fast, secure, and fully compliant QR Code generation.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 What is PIX?\n\nPIX is a **real-time payment system** developed by the **Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN)**.  \nIt allows instant transfers between banks, available 24/7, without fees for individuals.  \nBusinesses widely use PIX for quick, easy, and reliable payments — making QR Codes an essential tool for sales, subscriptions, and customer service.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ What this Workflow Does\n\n- Creates a **fully compliant PIX payment code** with automatic checksum (CRC)  \n- Generates a **dynamic QR Code** that customers can scan with any banking app  \n- Returns:\n  - The full **PIX EMV payment code** (ready for integration)  \n  - A **public URL** linking to the QR Code image  \n  - Clean payment metadata for frontend or messaging bots\n\nAll generated dynamically from the user's input: key, amount, receiver name, city, and payment description.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 How it Works\n\n1. The user provides basic payment information: key, amount, name, city, and description.  \n2. The workflow assembles a PIX payload following BACEN's EMV QR standards.  \n3. It automatically generates and attaches the CRC (checksum) for validation.  \n4. A QR Code is created based on the complete PIX code.  \n5. The output returns both the **PIX code** and a **QR Code image URL**, ready to use anywhere.\n\nEach component works seamlessly to deliver a ready-to-scan QR Code for instant payments.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ How to Set Up\n\n1. **Deploy the workflow** on your n8n Cloud or self-hosted instance.  \n2. **Configure the input variables** manually or through an API/Webhook:\n   - `pixKey`: Your PIX key (CPF, CNPJ, email, phone, or random)  \n   - `receiverName`: Name of the individual or company receiving the payment  \n   - `city`: City name associated with the receiver  \n   - `amount`: Payment value (in BRL, ex: 79.90)  \n   - `description`: Short description for the transaction (optional)  \n3. **Trigger the workflow**:\n   - Manually (for testing)  \n   - Via webhook/API (ideal for integrations with chatbots, e-commerce, CRM)  \n4. **Customize the flow** (optional):\n   - Set default values if user inputs are missing  \n   - Adjust QR Code size or styling (inside the QR Code generator node)  \n   - Connect to database/storage if you want to save issued PIX transactions\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Who is This For?\n\n- E-commerce stores needing instant payment links  \n- Chatbots or WhatsApp bots offering product sales or bookings  \n- CRM systems wanting to automate billing processes  \n- Subscription platforms requiring fast payment confirmation  \n- Any business wanting to **accept payments faster and smarter**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Requirements\n\n- Active **n8n Cloud** or **self-hosted** instance  \n- A valid PIX key (CPF, CNPJ, email, phone, or random key)  \n- Basic payment information: amount, city, receiver name, description  \n- No external paid APIs needed — fully open and server-side\n\n---\n\n### 🛒 Ready to Automate Your Payments?\n\n❤️ Buy ready-to-use workflows at: [https://iloveflows.com](https://iloveflows.com)  \n☁️ Try n8n Cloud with my partner link: [https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda)",
