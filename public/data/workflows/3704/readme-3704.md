### 💡 What is PIX?

PIX is a **real-time payment system** developed by the **Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN)**.  
It allows instant transfers between banks, available 24/7, without fees for individuals.  
Businesses widely use PIX for quick, easy, and reliable payments — making QR Codes an essential tool for sales, subscriptions, and customer service.

### ⚙️ What this Workflow Does

- Creates a **fully compliant PIX payment code** with automatic checksum (CRC)  
- Generates a **dynamic QR Code** that customers can scan with any banking app  
- Returns:
  - The full **PIX EMV payment code** (ready for integration)  
  - A **public URL** linking to the QR Code image  
  - Clean payment metadata for frontend or messaging bots

All generated dynamically from the user's input: key, amount, receiver name, city, and payment description.

### 🧠 How it Works

1. The user provides basic payment information: key, amount, name, city, and description.  
2. The workflow assembles a PIX payload following BACEN's EMV QR standards.  
3. It automatically generates and attaches the CRC (checksum) for validation.  
4. A QR Code is created based on the complete PIX code.  
5. The output returns both the **PIX code** and a **QR Code image URL**, ready to use anywhere.

Each component works seamlessly to deliver a ready-to-scan QR Code for instant payments.
