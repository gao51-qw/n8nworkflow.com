# Manage LinkedIn Invitations with Browserflow
**Automate personalized LinkedIn outreach while maintaining human-like behavior**

## Overview
This workflow helps you send targeted LinkedIn invitations with customized messages, automatically checking existing connections to avoid duplicate requests. Perfect for recruiters, sales professionals, and anyone building their professional network systematically.

## How It Works
1. **Contact Management**: Store your prospects in a Google Sheet with their LinkedIn profile URLs
2. **Connection Verification**: Automatically check if you're already connected to avoid duplicate invitations

4. **Progress Tracking**: Update the Google Sheet with invitation status

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Google account** with Sheets access

### Step-by-Step Setup

   - Extract the Sheet ID from your URL (the string between `/d/` and `/edit`)

2. **Configure Workflow Settings**
   - Open the `settings` node and enter your Google Sheet ID
   - Customize your invitation message in the `message` node
   - Set up your Google Sheets credentials
   - Configure your Browserflow credentials

3. **Populate Your Data**

## Important Considerations

- **Responsible Usage**: This tool mimics human behavior and respects LinkedIn's natural usage patterns. It's designed for quality networking, not mass spamming.

- **Rate Limits**: Stay within LinkedIn's acceptable limits.

- **Account Safety**: Excessive automation can result in LinkedIn restrictions. Always prioritize authentic, valuable connections.
