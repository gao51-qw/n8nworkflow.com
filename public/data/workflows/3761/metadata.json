  "title": "Email assistant: convert natural language to SQL queries with Phi4-mini and PostgreSQL",
  "description": "# Who is this for?\n\n🧑🏻🫱🏻‍🫲🏻🤖 **Humans** and **Robots** alike.\n\nThis workflow can be used as a *Chat Trigger*, as well as a *Workflow Trigger*.\n\nIt will take a natural language request, and then generate a `SQL` query. The resulting `query` parameter will contain the query, and a `sqloutput` parameter will contain the results of executing such query.\n\n## What's the use case?\n\nThis template is most useful paired with other workflows that extract e-mail information and store it in a structured Postgres table, and use LLMs to understand inquiries about information contained in an e-mail inbox and formulate questions that needs answering.\n\nPlus, the prompt can be easily adapted to formulate SQL queries over any kind of structured database.\n\n## Privacy and Economics\n\nAs LLM provider I'm using **Ollama** locally, as I consider my e-mail extremely sensitive information. As model, [`phi4-mini`](https://ollama.com/library/phi4-mini) does an excellent job balancing quality and efficiency.\n\n## Setup\n\nUpon running for the first time, this workflow will *automatically* trigger a sub-section to read all tables and extract their schema into a local file.\n\nThen, either by *chatting* with the workflow in n8n's interface or by using it as a *sub-workflow*, you will get a `query` and a `sqloutput` response.\n\n## Customizations\n\nIf you want to work with just one particular table yet keep edits at bay, append a condition to the `List all tables in a database` step, like so:\n\n```sql\nWHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='my_emails_table_name'\n```\n\nTo repurpose this workflow to work with any other data corpus in a structured database, inspect the `AI Agent` *user* and *system* prompts and edit them accordingly.\n",
