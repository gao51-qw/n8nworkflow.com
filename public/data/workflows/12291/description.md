This workflow automates AI-powered search insights by combining SE Ranking AI Search data with OpenAI summarization. It starts with a manual trigger and fetches the time-series AI visibility data via the SE Ranking API. The response is summarized using OpenAI to produce both detailed and concise insights. 

The workflow enriches the original metrics with these AI-generated summaries and exports the final structured JSON to disk, making it ready for reporting, analytics, or further automation.
