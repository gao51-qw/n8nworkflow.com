### ⚙️ How it Works

**Trigger**: iMessage webhook via Blooio receives user message or image  
**Check**: Bot ignores self-sent messages to prevent loops  
**Detect**: If a photo is attached, it’s passed to AI for card recognition  
**Interpret**: The AI agent gives a heartfelt, symbolic interpretation  
**Respond**: A final, warm tarot reading is sent back through iMessage
