This workflow provides an OAuth 2.0 auth token refresh process for better control. Developers can utilize it as an alternative to n8n's built-in OAuth flow to achieve improved control and visibility. In this template, I've used [Pipedrive API](https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Oauth#get-tokens), but users can apply it with any app that requires the authorization_code for token access.

This resolves the issue of manually refreshing the OAuth 2.0 token when it expires, or when n8n's native OAuth stops working.

## What you need to replicate this

1. Your database with a pre-existing table for storing authentication tokens and associated information. I'm using Supabase in this example, but you can also employ a self-hosted MySQL.

Here's a [quick video](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZiXhEV8N0y) on setting up the Supabase table.


2. Create a client app for your chosen application that you want to access via the API.

3. After duplicating the template:

a. Add credentials to your database and connect the DB nodes in all 3 workflows.

4. Enable/Publish the first workflow, "1. Generate and Save Pipedrive tokens to Database."

5. Open your client app and follow the Pipedrive instructions to authenticate.

Click on [Install and test](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/image/49321214?key=886672146f2ba1b1482d43a625b72f10).


This will save your initial refresh token and access token to the database.

## How it operates

**Workflow 1**. Create a workflow to capture the authorization_code, generate the access_token, and refresh the token, and then save the token to the database.

**Workflow 2**. Develop your primary workflow to fetch or post data to/from your application. Observe the logic to include an if condition when an error occurs with an invalid token. This triggers the third workflow to refresh the token.

**Workflow 3**. This workflow will handle the token refresh. Remember to send the unique ID to the webhook to fetch the necessary tokens from your table.
