# GPT-4o Resume Screener with Error Handling - Google Sheets & Drive Pipeline

## How it works

Enterprise-grade resume screening automation built for production environments. This workflow combines intelligent AI analysis with comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable processing of candidate applications. Every potential failure point is monitored with automatic recovery and notification systems.

**Core workflow steps:**
1. **Intelligent Email Processing** - Monitors Gmail with attachment validation and file type detection
2. **Robust File Handling** - Multi-format support with upload verification and extraction validation
3. **Quality-Controlled AI Analysis** - GPT-4o evaluation with output validation and fallback mechanisms
4. **Verified Data Extraction** - Contact and qualification extraction with data integrity checks
5. **Dual Logging System** - Success tracking in main dashboard, error logging in separate audit trail

**Error Recovery Features:**
- Upload failure detection with retry mechanisms
- Text extraction validation with quality thresholds
- AI processing timeout protection and fallback responses
- Data validation before final logging
- Comprehensive error notification and tracking system

## Set up steps

**Total setup time: 25-35 minutes**

### Core Credentials Setup (8 minutes)
- Gmail OAuth2 with attachment permissions
- Google Drive API with folder creation rights
- Google Sheets API with read/write access
- OpenAI API key with GPT-4o model access

### Primary Configuration (12 minutes)
1. **Configure monitoring systems** - Set up Gmail trigger with error detection
2. **Establish file processing pipeline** - Create Drive folders for resumes and configure upload validation
3. **Deploy dual spreadsheet system** - Set up main tracking sheet and error logging sheet
4. **Initialize AI processing** - Configure GPT-4o with structured output parsing and timeout settings
5. **Customize job requirements** - Update role specifications and scoring criteria

### Error Handling Setup (10 minutes)
1. **Configure error notifications** - Set administrator email for failure alerts
2. **Set up error logging spreadsheet** - Create audit trail for failed processing attempts
3. **Customize timeout settings** - Adjust processing limits based on expected file sizes
4. **Test error pathways** - Validate notification system with sample failures

### Advanced Customization (5 minutes)
- Modify validation thresholds for resume quality
