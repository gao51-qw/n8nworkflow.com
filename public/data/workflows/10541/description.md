## How it works
This workflow automatically detects new image files uploaded to a Google Drive folder, extracts Japanese text using OCR, summarizes it with AI, and records the result in Google Sheets.  
Finally, it sends a completion email notification with the file name and summary.

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Google Drive New File Trigger** – Watches a specific Google Drive folder for new image uploads.  
2. **Download Image File** – Downloads the newly uploaded image for processing.  
3. **Extract Text with OCR.space** – Sends the image to the OCR.space API to extract text (Japanese supported).  
4. **Format OCR Result & Check for Empty** – Cleans and validates the extracted text.  
5. **Generate Summary with OpenRouter AI** – Uses an AI model to generate a short summary of the text.  
6. **OpenRouter Chat Model** – Connects the AI Agent to the OpenRouter language model.  
7. **Append row in sheet** – Adds the file name, AI summary, and processing date to Google Sheets.  
8. **Send Completion Notification via Gmail** – Sends an email with the summarized content and Google Sheets link.  
9. **Process Completed** – Marks the workflow’s successful end.
