  "description": "In Grist, when I mark a row as confirmed (via a toggle):\n![image.png](fileId:787)\n\na webhook is set up to notify n8n, and this workflow will create derived records in the destination table.\n\n### Design decisions\n#### Confirmation-based\nIn the source table **there is a boolean column \"Confirmed\" that will trigger the transfer**.\nThis way there is a manual check involved & it's a conscious step to trigger the workflow.\n#### Runs once\nIf the destination table already contains an entry, **we will not re-create/update** it (as it might've already been changed manually)\n\n\n### Setup\n1. Create a boolean column `Confirmed` in source table\n2. **Add a webhook** in [Grist Settings](https://support.getgrist.com/newsletters/2023-05/#webhooks)\n3. Add grist **API credentials** in n8n\n4. Set **document ID** & source **table ID/Name** in the '**get existing**' node\n3. Set **docID**, the destination **table ID/Name** - and the **columns & values** you want in the **Create Row** node",
