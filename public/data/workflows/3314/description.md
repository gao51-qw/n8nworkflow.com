# WebSecScan: AI-Powered Website Security Auditor

This n8n workflow provides comprehensive website security analysis by leveraging OpenAI's models to detect vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and security misconfigurations. The workflow generates a professional HTML security report delivered directly via Gmail.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Layer Security Analysis:** Performs parallel security audits using specialized OpenAI agents:
  - Header Configuration Audit: Analyzes HTTP headers, CORS policies, CSP implementation, and cookie security
  - Vulnerability Assessment: Identifies XSS vectors, information disclosure, and client-side weaknesses
  
- **Detailed Security Grading:** Automatically calculates a security grade (A+ to F) based on findings severity and quantity

- **Professional Report Generation:** Creates a comprehensive HTML report with:
  - Security grade visualization
  - Color-coded vulnerability categories
  - Detailed recommendations with example configuration fixes
  - Header presence/absence indicators
  - Implementation guidance for remediation

- **Non-Invasive Testing:** Performs analysis without active scanning or exploitation attempts

## Technical Implementation

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Utilizes two specialized OpenAI agents with custom prompts tailored for security analysis
- **Advanced Header Analysis:** Detects presence and proper implementation of critical security headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy

- **Intelligent Issue Detection:** Uses JavaScript processing to analyze OpenAI outputs and count critical/warning issues
- **Responsive HTML Report:** Dynamically generates a mobile-friendly report with detailed findings and recommendations
