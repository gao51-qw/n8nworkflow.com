The workflow generates a professional HTML security report delivered directly via Gmail.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Dual-Layer Security Analysis:** Performs parallel security audits using specialized OpenAI agents:\n  - Header Configuration Audit: Analyzes HTTP headers, CORS policies, CSP implementation, and cookie security\n  - Vulnerability Assessment: Identifies XSS vectors, information disclosure, and client-side weaknesses\n  \n- **Detailed Security Grading:** Automatically calculates a security grade (A+ to F) based on findings severity and quantity\n\n- **Professional Report Generation:** Creates a comprehensive HTML report with:\n  - Security grade visualization\n  - Color-coded vulnerability categories\n  - Detailed recommendations with example configuration fixes\n  - Header presence/absence indicators\n  - Implementation guidance for remediation\n\n- **Non-Invasive Testing:** Performs analysis without active scanning or exploitation attempts\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Utilizes two specialized OpenAI agents with custom prompts tailored for security analysis\n- **Advanced Header Analysis:** Detects presence and proper implementation of critical security headers:\n  - Content-Security-Policy\n  - Strict-Transport-Security\n  - X-Content-Type-Options\n  - X-Frame-Options\n  - Referrer-Policy\n  - Permissions-Policy\n\n- **Intelligent Issue Detection:** Uses JavaScript processing to analyze OpenAI outputs and count critical/warning issues\n- **Responsive HTML Report:** Dynamically generates a mobile-friendly report with detailed findings and recommendations\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n### 1. OpenAI API Configuration\n1. Create an OpenAI API key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)\n2. In n8n, go to **Settings → Credentials → New → OpenAI API**\n3. Enter your API key and save\n\n### 2. Gmail Integration\n1. Navigate to **Settings → Credentials → New → Gmail OAuth2 API**\n2. Complete the OAuth authentication flow\n3. Configure recipient email in the \"Send Security Report\" node\n\n### 3. Workflow Customization (Optional)\n- Modify the form title/description in the Landing Page node\n- Upgrade from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4o for more comprehensive analysis\n- Add additional recipients to the email report\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\n1. Activate the workflow and access the form via the generated URL\n2. Enter any website URL to analyze (including the http:// or https:// prefix)\n3. Receive a detailed security report via email within minutes\n4. Share findings with your development team to implement fixes\n\n---\n\nThis workflow represents a non-invasive security assessment tool. For production environments, complement with professional penetration testing services.",
