# Transform articles into children's audiobooks and comics via Telegram & BrowserAct

This workflow acts as an AI Storyteller. Send an article link to your Telegram bot, and it will rewrite the content into an engaging children's story, generate a multi-panel comic book visualization, produce a narrated audiobook using ElevenLabs, and deliver the entire multimedia package back to your chat.

## Target Audience
Parents, educators, and content creators looking to repurpose existing articles into kid-friendly, engaging formats.

## How it works
1. **Analyze Intent**: The workflow receives a message via **Telegram**. An **AI Agent** classifies it: is it a casual chat or a story request (a link)?
2. **Fetch Content**: If a link is detected, **BrowserAct** scrapes the text from the target webpage.
3. **Creative Production**: A "Scriptwriter" AI Agent (using OpenRouter/Gemini) rewrites the article into a whimsical children's story, generates scene descriptions for a comic book, and drafts a social media caption.
4. **Generate Audio**: **ElevenLabs** converts the story text into a narrated MP3 file.
5. **Generate Visuals**: The workflow loops through the AI-generated scene descriptions, using **Google Gemini** to create comic book-style images for each part of the story.
6. **Deliver**: The bot sends the audiobook, the comic panels, and the story text to your **Telegram** chat.

## How to set up
1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **Telegram**, **BrowserAct**, **ElevenLabs**, **Google Gemini**, and **OpenRouter** accounts in n8n.
2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Children’s Book Storytelling & Illustration** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.
3. **Configure Telegram**: Ensure your bot is created via BotFather and the API token is added to the Telegram credentials.
4. **Select Voice**: Open the **Convert text to speech** node and choose a suitable narrator voice from ElevenLabs.
5. **Activate**: Turn on the workflow.
6. **Test**: Send an article link to your bot to start the storytelling process.

## Requirements
* **BrowserAct** account with the **Children’s Book Storytelling & Illustration** template.
* **ElevenLabs** account.
* **Telegram** account (Bot Token).
* **Google Gemini** & **OpenRouter** accounts.

## How to customize the workflow
1. **Change Art Style**: Modify the system prompt in the **Scriptwriter** agent to request a different visual style (e.g., "Watercolor," "Pixel Art," or "Disney Style").
2. **Adjust Story Tone**: Update the **Scriptwriter** prompt to change the target age group or genre (e.g., "Spooky Ghost Story" or "Sci-Fi Adventure").
3. **Add PDF Export**: Add a **PDF** node to compile the text and images into a downloadable eBook file.
