Ever wanted to just tell your 3d printer what to do remotely? 

This game changer let's you converse with OpenAI agents to manage OctoPrint connected 3d printers. Great for remote management and monitoring with easy to read responses.

Query what jobs are available, Load a print job (**upload workflow in development, will be released soon for community use**), start the print job and request detailed reports on your printers performance as it runs.
