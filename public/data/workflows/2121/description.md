## Use case
If you have a form where potential leads reach out, then you probably want to analyze those leads and send a notification if certain requirements are met, e.g. employee number is high enough. MadKudu is built exactly to solve this problem. We use it along with Hunter and Telegram to get a message for high quality leads.
