  "title": "Multi-tool research agent for animal advocacy with OpenRouter, Serper & Open Paws DB",
  "description": "This general-purpose sub-agent combines multiple research and automation tools to support high-impact decision-making for animal advocacy workflows. It’s designed to act as a reusable, modular unit within larger multi-agent systems—handling search, scraping, scoring, and domain-specific semantic lookup.\n\nIt powers many of the advanced workflows released by Open Paws and serves as a versatile backend utility agent.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ What It Does\n\n- Performs real-time **Google Search** using Serper  \n- Scrapes and extracts page content using **Jina AI** and **Scraping Dog**  \n- Conducts **semantic search** over the Open Paws knowledge base  \n- Generates **OpenAI embeddings** for similarity search and analysis  \n- Routes search and content analysis through **OpenRouter LLMs**  \n- Connects with downstream tools like the **Text Scoring Sub-Workflow** to evaluate message performance\n\n&gt; 🧩 This agent is typically used as a **sub-workflow** in larger automations where agents need access to external tools or advocacy-specific knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Domain Focus: Animal Advocacy\n\nThe agent is pre-configured to interface with the Open Paws database—an open-source, animal advocacy-specific knowledge graph—and is optimized for content and research tasks relevant to farmed animal issues, corporate campaigns, and activist communication.\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Integrated Tools and APIs\n\n| Tool          | Purpose                                 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Serper API**        | Real-time Google Search queries             |\n| **Jina AI**           | Web scraping and content extraction         |\n| **Scraping Dog**      | Social media scraping where Jina is blocked |\n| **OpenAI API**        | Embedding generation for semantic search    |\n| **OpenRouter**        | Proxy to multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)|\n| **Open Paws DB**      | Advocacy-specific semantic knowledge base   |\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Use Cases\n\n- Create and evaluate online content (e.g. social media, emails, petitions) for predicted performance and advocacy alignment  \n- Act as a research and reasoning agent within multi-agent workflows  \n- Automate web and social media research for real-time campaign support  \n- Surface relevant facts or arguments from an advocacy-specific knowledge base  \n- Assist communications teams with message testing and content ideation  \n- Monitor search results and scrape pages to inform rapid response messaging  \n\n",
