🚀 Built an AI-Powered Reddit Engagement (Reddit auto comment to relevant posts based on your whish. A workflow That Actually Helps People and helps you to promote your product and service.

  Just spent hours fine-tuning an n8n automation that genuinely adds value to Reddit conversations and to your service, app, business or message that you want to promote. Here's what it does:

  The Challenge: Finding relevant discussions where my service, app, business or message could actually help someone - without being spammy or salesy.

  The Solution: An intelligent workflow that:
  - 🔍 Monitors multiple subreddits for photo editing discussions
  - 🧠 Uses GPT-4.1 to analyze comments (not just posts!) for genuine need
  - 🎯 Filters out bots, moderators, and irrelevant content
  - ✍️ Crafts helpful, conversational responses that provide value first
  - 📊 Tracks everything in Google Sheets for transparency

  Key Features:
  - Runs every 3 hours automatically
  - Analyzes comment context, not just keywords
  - Only engages when the service, app, business or message is genuinely relevant
  - Focuses on helping, mentions the app naturally if appropriate
  - Respects Reddit culture and community guidelines

  Why This Matters: Instead of blind self-promotion, this creates genuine interactions. When someone asks "Anyone know a good service, app, business to do XYZ?", they get a helpful response from someone
  who's actually built a solution.

  Tech Stack: n8n, OpenAI GPT-4, Reddit API, Google Sheets

  The best part? It forces me to only engage where I can add real value. No spam, just helpful participation in communities I care about.
