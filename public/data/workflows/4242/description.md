**⚠️ DISCLAIMER:** This workflow uses the AnySite LinkedIn community node, which is only available on self-hosted n8n instances. It will not work on n8n.cloud.

## Overview
This n8n workflow automates the enrichment of CRM contact data with professional insights from LinkedIn profiles. The workflow integrates with both Pipedrive and HubSpot CRMs, finding LinkedIn profiles that match your contacts and updating your CRM with valuable information about their professional background and recent activities.

## Key Features
- **Multi-CRM Support**: Works with both Pipedrive and HubSpot
- **AI-Powered Data Enrichment**: Uses an advanced AI agent to analyze and summarize professional information
- **Automated Triggers**: Activates when new contacts are added or when enrichment is requested
- **Comprehensive Profile Analysis**: Captures LinkedIn profile summaries and post activity

## How It Works

### Triggers
The workflow activates in three scenarios:
1. When a new contact is created in CRM
2. When a contact is updated in CRM with an enrichment flag

### LinkedIn Data Collection Process
1. **Email Lookup**: First tries to find the LinkedIn profile using the contact's email
2. **Advanced Search**: If email lookup fails, uses name and company details to find potential matches
3. **Profile Analysis**: Collects comprehensive profile information
4. **Post Analysis**: Gathers and analyzes the contact's recent LinkedIn activity

### CRM Updates
The workflow updates your CRM with:
- LinkedIn profile URL
- Professional summary (skills, experience, background)
- Analysis of recent LinkedIn posts and activity

## Customization Options

### AI Agent Prompts
You can modify the system prompts in the "Data Enrichment AI Agent" nodes to:
- Change the focus of profile analysis
- Adjust the tone and detail level of summaries
- Customize what information is extracted from posts

### CRM Field Mapping
The workflow is pre-configured to update specific custom fields in Pipedrive and HubSpot. Update the field/property mappings in:
- "Update data in Pipedrive" nodes
- "Update data in HubSpot" node

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **LinkedIn Profile Not Found**: Check if the contact's email is their work email; consider adjusting the search parameters
- **Webhook Not Triggering**: Verify webhook configuration in your CRM
- **Missing Custom Fields**: Ensure all required custom fields are created in your CRM with correct names

### Rate Limits
- Be aware of LinkedIn API rate limits (managed by AnySite LinkedIn node)
- Consider implementing delays if processing large batches of contacts

## Best Practices
- Use enrichment flags to selectively update contacts rather than enriching all contacts
- Review and clean contact data in your CRM before enrichment
- Periodically review the AI-generated summaries to ensure quality and relevance
