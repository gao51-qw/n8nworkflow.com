## What it does

This n8n workflow:
1. **Receives documents** from two sources:
   - LINE webhook (via Messaging API)
   - Google Drive (new file trigger)
2. **Checks file type** (PDF or image)
3. **Runs OCR** with Mistral AI (Document or Image model)
4. **Uses OpenAI** to extract key metadata such as:
   - book_id
   - subject
   - recipient (to)
   - signatory
   - date, contact info, etc.
5. **Stores structured data** in Google Sheets
6. **Replies to LINE user** with extracted info or moves files into archive folders (Drive)

## How to Set It Up

1. Create a Google Sheet with a tab named `data` and the following columns [Example Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asLDGXnPA4K55RfLDGRkgQzOpnKezDoVibWgnGaGUJ0/edit?usp=sharing):
   - `book_id`, `date`, `subject`, `to`, `attach`, `detail`, `signed_by`, `signed_by_position`, `contact_phone`, `contact_email`, `download_url`
2. Set up required credentials:
   - `googleDriveOAuth2Api`
   - `googleSheetsOAuth2Api`
   - `httpHeaderAuth` for LINE Messaging API
   - `openAiApi`
   - `mistralCloudApi`
3. Define environment variables:
   - `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `GDRIVE_INVOICE_FOLDER_ID`
   - `GSHEET_ID`
   - `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
4. Deploy webhook to receive files from LINE Messaging API (Path: `/line-invoice`)
5. Monitor Drive uploads using `Google Drive Trigger`
