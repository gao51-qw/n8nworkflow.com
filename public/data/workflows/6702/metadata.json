It uses Mistral AI for OCR and OpenAI for information extraction, saving results to a Google Sheet.\n\n---\n\n## Who’s it for?\n\n- Thai government agencies or teams receiving official documents via LINE or Google Drive\n- Automation developers working with document intake and OCR\n- Anyone needing to extract fields from Thai scanned letters and store structured info\n\n---\n\n## What it does\n\nThis n8n workflow:\n1. **Receives documents** from two sources:\n   - LINE webhook (via Messaging API)\n   - Google Drive (new file trigger)\n2. **Checks file type** (PDF or image)\n3. **Runs OCR** with Mistral AI (Document or Image model)\n4. **Uses OpenAI** to extract key metadata such as:\n   - book_id\n   - subject\n   - recipient (to)\n   - signatory\n   - date, contact info, etc.\n5. **Stores structured data** in Google Sheets\n6. **Replies to LINE user** with extracted info or moves files into archive folders (Drive)\n\n---\n\n## How to Set It Up\n\n1. Create a Google Sheet with a tab named `data` and the following columns [Example Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asLDGXnPA4K55RfLDGRkgQzOpnKezDoVibWgnGaGUJ0/edit?usp=sharing):\n   - `book_id`, `date`, `subject`, `to`, `attach`, `detail`, `signed_by`, `signed_by_position`, `contact_phone`, `contact_email`, `download_url`\n2. Set up required credentials:\n   - `googleDriveOAuth2Api`\n   - `googleSheetsOAuth2Api`\n   - `httpHeaderAuth` for LINE Messaging API\n   - `openAiApi`\n   - `mistralCloudApi`\n3. Define environment variables:\n   - `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN`\n   - `GDRIVE_INVOICE_FOLDER_ID`\n   - `GSHEET_ID`\n   - `MISTRAL_API_KEY`\n4. Deploy webhook to receive files from LINE Messaging API (Path: `/line-invoice`)\n5. Monitor Drive uploads using `Google Drive Trigger`\n\n---\n\n## How to Customize the Workflow\n\n- Adjust the **information extraction schema** in the OpenAI `Information Extractor` node to match your document layout\n- Add logic for different document types if you have more than one format\n- Modify the `LINE Reply` message format or use Flex Message\n- Update the `Move File` node if you want to archive to a different folder\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n self-hosted or cloud instance\n- Google account with access to Drive and Sheets\n- LINE Developer Account\n- OpenAI API key\n- Mistral Cloud API key\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- Community nodes used: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.mistralAi`\n- This workflow **supports both document images and PDF files**\n- File handling is done dynamically via MIME type",
