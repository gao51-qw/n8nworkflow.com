### Context

Hi! I’m [Samir Saci](https://samirsaci.com),  a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

I help companies **optimise inventory and logistics operations** by combining **data analytics** and **workflow automation**.

This workflow is part of our **inventory optimisation toolkit**, allowing businesses to perform **ABC classification and Pareto analysis** directly from their transactional sales data.

&gt; Automate inventory segmentation with n8n!

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is designed for **supply chain analysts**, **demand planners**, or **inventory managers** who want to:

- Identify their top-performing items (Pareto 80/20 principle)  
- Classify products into **ABC categories** based on sales contribution  
- Evaluate demand variability (XYZ classification support)  

Imagine you have a **Google Sheet** where daily sales transactions are stored:

[![Example Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/image.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbAA-cq9X_E)

The workflow aggregates sales by item, calculates cumulative contribution, and assigns **A, B, or C** classes. It also computes **mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (CV)** to highlight demand volatility.

### How does it work?

This workflow automates the process of **ABC & Pareto analysis from raw sales data**:

- 📊 Google Sheets input provides daily transactional sales  
- 🧮 Aggregation & code nodes compute sales, turnover, and cumulative shares  
- 🧠 ABC class mapping assigns items into A/B/C buckets  
- 📈 Demand variability metrics (XYZ) are calculated  
- 📑 Results are appended into dedicated Google Sheets tabs for reporting

### Steps:

1. 📝 Load daily sales records from Google Sheets  
2. 🔎 Filter out items with zero sales  
3. 📊 Aggregate sales by **store**, **item**, and **day**  
4. 📈 Perform Pareto analysis to calculate cumulative turnover share  
5. 🧮 Compute demand variability (mean, stdev, CV)  
6. 🧠 Assign ABC classes based on cumulative share thresholds  
7. 📥 Append results into **ABC XYZ** and **Pareto** output sheets

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:

- A **Google Sheet** with sales transactions (date, item, quantity, turnover) that is available here: [Test Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsS_pj3o8yMEIQ59QBU80sx20HtkkTgCKJB32sOge1o/edit?usp=sharing)  
- A **Google Sheets account** connected in n8n  
- Basic knowledge of inventory analysis (ABC/XYZ)  

### Next Steps

🗒️ Use the sticky notes in the n8n canvas to:

- Add your Google Sheets credentials  
- Replace the Sheet ID with your own sales dataset  
- Run the workflow and check the output tabs: **ABC XYZ**, **Pareto**, and **Store Sales**
