  "title": "YouTube Videos to Viral X Threads by Keywords (using Gemini & Claude)",
  "description": "# Who is this for?\nContent creators, marketers, and social media managers who want to turn high-performing YouTube videos into viral X (Twitter) threads using keywords (without manual research). Perfect for anyone looking to systematically create engaging social content from proven video sources.\n\n---\n\n# What problem does it solve?\nFinding viral content ideas and writing engaging threads is time-consuming and hit-or-miss. This workflow automates the entire process: discovers high-performing YouTube videos based on your keywords, extracts key insights using AI, and generates multiple viral thread variations using proven patterns from 12.5M+ view threads.\n\n---\n\n# How it works\n\n| # | Node | Purpose |\n|---|------|---------|\n| 1 | **Form Trigger** | Captures your keyword, target audience, and content type preferences. |\n| 2 | **YouTube Video Search** | Finds recent videos (April 2025+) matching your keyword, sorted by view count. |\n| 3 | **Get Video Statistics** | Fetches detailed metrics (views, engagement) for discovered videos. |\n| 4 | **Filter High-Performers** | Keeps only videos with 100K+ views and excludes YouTube Shorts. |\n| 5 | **Top 5 Selection** | Limits to the best 2 videos to focus on proven winners. |\n| 6 | **Save Video Candidates** | Logs discovered videos to Google Sheets for manual approval. |\n| 7 | **Wait & Check Approval** | Pauses 30 seconds, then checks which videos you marked \"Yes\" for thread generation. |\n| 8 | **Video Analysis (Gemini)** | Uses Google's Gemini AI to extract key insights, tools, and strategies from approved videos. |\n| 9 | **Thread Generation (Claude)** | Applies viral thread database patterns to create 3 distinct thread variations using Claude Sonnet 4. |\n| 10 | **Structure & Save Threads** | Formats the generated threads and saves them back to Google Sheets for review and posting. |\n\n---\n\n# Setup steps\n\n1. **Import & configure credentials**\n  * Import the JSON workflow into n8n\n  * Add your **YouTube Data API** key (get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/))\n  * Add your **Google Gemini API** key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))\n  * Connect **Anthropic API** for Claude access\n  * Set up **Google Sheets OAuth2** credential\n\n2. **Create your tracking spreadsheet**\n  * The workflow auto-creates a sheet with columns: `Keyword`, `Youtube video title`, `Description`, `Video URL`, `Turn into thread?`, `Thread 1`, `Thread 2`, `Thread 3`\n  * You'll manually review and mark videos \"Yes\" in the `Turn into thread?` column\n\n3. **Configure the viral thread database**\n  * The workflow includes proven patterns from threads with 12.5M+ views\n  * Adjust the target audience and content style in the AI prompts if needed\n\n4. **Test the workflow**\n  * Submit the form with a keyword like \"AI automation\"\n  * Check that videos appear in your Google Sheet\n  * Mark one \"Yes\" and verify threads are generated\n\n---\n\n# Resources\n\n* [YouTube Data API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)\n* [Google Gemini AI Platform](https://ai.google.dev/)\n* [Anthropic Claude API](https://docs.anthropic.com/)\n* [n8n Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/)\n* [Viral Thread Generator Demo](https://gamma.app/docs/Viral-XThreadGenerator--wce7q6wtkdilz35?mode=doc)\n\n---\n\n# Extending the workflow\n\n* **Auto-posting** – Connect X API to automatically post generated threads\n* **Competitor tracking** – Monitor specific channels for new content opportunities  \n* **Multi-platform** – Adapt threads for LinkedIn, Instagram, or TikTok formats\n* **Performance tracking** – Log thread performance back to sheets for optimization\n* **Webhook triggers** – Set up Zapier integration for form submissions from other tools\n\nTransform proven YouTube content into viral social media threads—systematically and at scale.",
