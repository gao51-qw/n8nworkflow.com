#  AI-Powered Website Chatbot with Google Drive Knowledge Base


##  Overview
This workflow combines **website chatbot intelligence** with **automated document ingestion and vectorization** — enabling live Q&A from both **chat input** and **processed Google Drive files**.  
It uses **Mistral AI** for OCR + embeddings, and **Qdrant** for vector search.

##  Chatbot Flow
- **Trigger:** `When chat message received` or `webhook` based upon deployed chatbot
- **Model:** `OpenAI gpt-4.1-mini`
- **Memory:** `Simple Memory (Buffer Window)`
- **Vector Search Tool:** `Qdrant Vector Store `
- **Embeddings:** `Mistral Cloud`
- **Agent:** `website chat agent`
  - Responds based on `chatdbtai` Supabase content
  - Enforces brand tone and informative documents.

##  Document → Knowledge Base Pipeline
Triggered manually to keep vector store up-to-date.

### Steps
1. **Google Drive (brand folder)**  
   → Fetch files from folder `Website kb (ID: 1o3DK9Ceka5Lqb8irvFSfEeB8SVGG_OL7)`
2. **Loop Over Items**  
   → For each file:
   - `Set metadata`
   - `Download file`
   - `Upload to Mistral` for OCR
   - `Get Signed URL`
   - `Run OCR extraction` (`mistral-ocr-latest`)
3. **If OCR success**  
   → Pass to chunking pipeline  
   Else → skip and continue
4. **Chunking Logic (`Code` node)**  
   - Splits document into 1,000-character JSON chunks  
   - Adds metadata (source, char positions, file ID)
5. **Default Data Loader + Text Splitter**  
   → Prepares chunks for embedding
6. **Embeddings (Mistral Cloud)**  
   → Generates embeddings for text chunks
7. **Qdrant Vector Store (Insert mode)**  
   → Saves embeddings into `docragtestkb` collection
8. **Wait**  
   → Optional delay between batches
