# Automate Audio Transcription, AI Summarization, and Google Drive Storage

## Who is this for?  
**Content Teams**, **Researchers**, and **Administrators** who need to automatically process voice memos, meeting recordings, or interview audio into structured, searchable documents.

## What problem does this solve?  
Eliminates manual transcription work by automatically converting audio files into organized text documents with AI analysis, while maintaining human oversight through approval workflows.

## What this workflow does  
1. **Smart Audio Processing**:  
   - Triggers when new .m4a files appear in Google Drive  
   - Uses OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcription  
   - Implements dual-format reporting (JSON + Markdown)  

2. **Human Oversight (optional)**:  
   - Requires email approval before processing  
   - 45-minute response window with escalation options  

3. **AI-Powered Analysis**:  
   - Generates structured JSON reports with:  
     - Key points & action items  
     - Sentiment analysis  
     - Technical terminology glossary  
   - Creates Markdown versions for easy reading  

4. **Document Management**:  
   - Stores raw transcripts + reports in Google Drive  
   - Automatic file naming with timestamps  
   - Sends completion alerts via Email/Telegram
