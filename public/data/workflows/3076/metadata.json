  "description": "# Automate Audio Transcription, AI Summarization, and Google Drive Storage\n\n## Who is this for?  \n**Content Teams**, **Researchers**, and **Administrators** who need to automatically process voice memos, meeting recordings, or interview audio into structured, searchable documents.\n\n## What problem does this solve?  \nEliminates manual transcription work by automatically converting audio files into organized text documents with AI analysis, while maintaining human oversight through approval workflows.\n\n## What this workflow does  \n1. **Smart Audio Processing**:  \n   - Triggers when new .m4a files appear in Google Drive  \n   - Uses OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcription  \n   - Implements dual-format reporting (JSON + Markdown)  \n\n2. **Human Oversight (optional)**:  \n   - Requires email approval before processing  \n   - 45-minute response window with escalation options  \n\n3. **AI-Powered Analysis**:  \n   - Generates structured JSON reports with:  \n     - Key points & action items  \n     - Sentiment analysis  \n     - Technical terminology glossary  \n   - Creates Markdown versions for easy reading  \n\n4. **Document Management**:  \n   - Stores raw transcripts + reports in Google Drive  \n   - Automatic file naming with timestamps  \n   - Sends completion alerts via Email/Telegram  \n\nWorkflow visualization showing audio file processing path\n\n## Setup  \n1. **Credentials Needed**:  \n   - Google Drive API access  \n   - OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini)  \n   - Gmail & Telegram integrations  \n\n2. **Configuration**:  \n   - Set your Google Drive folder ID in 3 nodes  \n   - Update email addresses in Gmail nodes  \n   - Customize approval timeout in \"Gmail User for Approval\"  \n\n3. **Customization Points**:  \n   - File extension filters (.m4a)  \n   - AI report templates and prompts  \n   - Notification channels (Email/Telegram)  \n\n## How to customize  \n- **Approval Process**: Add SMS/Teams notifications via additional nodes  \n- **File Types**: Modify filter node for .mp3/.wav support  \n- **Analysis Depth**: Adjust GPT-4 prompts in \"Summarize to JSON\" nodes  \n- **Storage**: Connect to Notion/Airtable instead of Google Drive  \n",
