### 5. **Configure Social Media Publishing**

## 📊 Google Sheet Column Specifications

Your sheet must follow this exact column structure for seamless automation:

| Column | Header | Required | Format & Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|
| A | `Post Date` | Yes | `MM/DD/YYYY` – Suggested publish date (for your reference) |
| B | `Content` | Yes | Plain text or rich text (emojis allowed). Max 2,200 characters. |
| C | `Hashtags` | No | Comma-separated or space-separated hashtags (e.g., `#MindfulMarketing, #SolopreneurLife`). Auto-appended to post. |
| D | `Media URL` | No | Direct public link to image or video (must be hosted online: Google Drive *shared link*, Imgur, etc.). GIFs and MP4s supported. |
| E | `Platform` | Yes | `Facebook`, `Instagram`, or `Both` – determines where the post goes. |
| F | `Status` | Auto | Leave blank initially. Will be auto-updated to `Published - [Timestamp]` after posting. |
| G | `Notes` | No | Optional internal notes (e.g., campaign name, draft source). |

&gt; ✅ **Tip**: Freeze Row 1 (header row) and use Data Validation in Column E (`Facebook`, `Instagram`, `Both`) to prevent input errors.

## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

The SoftTech Sunday Scheduler runs a fully automated weekly cycle:

1. **Every Sunday at 7:00 PM**, the Make scenario triggers.
2. It scans your Google Sheet starting from **Row 2**, looking for the **first row with an empty `Status` cell**.
3. It pulls:
   - `Content`
   - `Hashtags` (appends to content)
   - `Media URL` (if present)
   - `Platform` (determines destination)
4. Using the **Meta API**, it publishes the post to your connected Facebook Page and/or Instagram Business Account.
5. Upon successful posting, it updates the `Status` column with `Published - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]`.
6. The next week, it moves to the next unpublished row—creating a **first-in, first-out content queue**.

🔁 **Evergreen Tip**: Duplicate your favorite content rows and insert them at the bottom to recycle high-performing posts.
