  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis beginner-friendly workflow demonstrates the core building blocks of n8n. It guides you through:\n\n - **Triggers** – Start workflows manually, on a schedule, via webhooks, or through chat.\n- **Data processing** – Use Set and Code nodes to create, transform, and enrich data.\n - **Logic and branching** – Apply conditions with IF nodes and merge different branches back together.\n- **API integrations** – Fetch external data (e.g., users from an API), split arrays into individual items, and extract useful fields.\n- **AI-powered steps** – Connect to OpenAI for generating fun facts or build interactive assistants with chat triggers, memory, and tools.\n- **Responses** – Return structured results via webhooks or summary nodes.\n\nBy the end, it demonstrates a full flow: creating data → transforming it → making decisions → calling APIs → using AI → responding with outputs.\n\n\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Time required: 5–10 minutes.**\n\n- What you need:\n  - An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).\n  - Optional: API credentials (e.g., OpenAI) if you want to test AI features.\n\n- Setup flow:\n  - Import this workflow.\n  - Add your API keys where needed (OpenAI, etc.).\n  - Trigger the workflow manually or test with webhooks.\n\n&gt;👉 Detailed node explanations and examples are already included as sticky notes inside the workflow itself, so you can learn step by step as you explore.",
