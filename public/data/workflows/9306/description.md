## How it works

This beginner-friendly workflow demonstrates the core building blocks of n8n. It guides you through:

 - **Triggers** – Start workflows manually, on a schedule, via webhooks, or through chat.
- **Data processing** – Use Set and Code nodes to create, transform, and enrich data.
 - **Logic and branching** – Apply conditions with IF nodes and merge different branches back together.
- **API integrations** – Fetch external data (e.g., users from an API), split arrays into individual items, and extract useful fields.
- **AI-powered steps** – Connect to OpenAI for generating fun facts or build interactive assistants with chat triggers, memory, and tools.
- **Responses** – Return structured results via webhooks or summary nodes.

By the end, it demonstrates a full flow: creating data → transforming it → making decisions → calling APIs → using AI → responding with outputs.



## Set up steps

**Time required: 5–10 minutes.**

- What you need:
  - An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).
  - Optional: API credentials (e.g., OpenAI) if you want to test AI features.

- Setup flow:
  - Import this workflow.
  - Add your API keys where needed (OpenAI, etc.).
  - Trigger the workflow manually or test with webhooks.
