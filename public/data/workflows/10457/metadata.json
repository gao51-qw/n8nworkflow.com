  "description": "## How It Works\nThe system collects real-time wearable health data, normalizes it, and uses AI to analyze trends and risk scores. It detects anomalies by comparing with historical patterns and automatically triggers alerts and follow-up actions when thresholds are exceeded.\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. **Configure Webhook Endpoint** - Set up webhook to receive data from wearable devices\n2. **Connect Database** - Initialize storage for health metrics and historical data\n3. **Set Normalization Rules** - Define data standardization parameters for different devices\n4. **Configure AI Model** - Set up health score calculation and risk prediction algorithms\n5. **Define Thresholds** - Establish alert triggers for critical health metrics\n6. **Connect Notification Channels** - Configure email and Slack integrations\n7. **Set Up Reporting** - Create automated report templates and schedules\n8. **Test Workflow** - Run end-to-end tests with sample health data\n\n## Workflow Template\nWebhook → Store Database → Normalize Data → Calculate Health Score → Analyze Metrics → Compare Previous → Check Threshold → Generate Reports/Alerts → Email/Slack → Schedule Follow-up\n\n\n## Workflow Steps\nIngest real-time wearable data via webhook, store and standardize it, and use GPT-4 for trend analysis and risk scoring. Monitor metrics against thresholds, trigger SMS, email, or Slack alerts, generate reports, and schedule follow-ups.\n\n## Setup Instructions\nConfigure webhook, database, GPT-4 API, notifications, calendar integration, and customize alert thresholds.\n\n## Prerequisites\nWearable API, patient database, GPT-4 key, email SMTP, optional Slack/Twilio, calendar integration.\n\n## Use Cases\nMonitor glucose for diabetics, track elderly vitals/fall risk, assess corporate wellness, and post-surgery recovery alerts.\n\n## Customization\nAdjust risk algorithms, add metrics, integrate telemedicine.\n\n## Benefits\nEarly intervention reduces readmissions and automates 80% of monitoring tasks.\n",
