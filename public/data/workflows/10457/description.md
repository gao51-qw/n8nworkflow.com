## How It Works
The system collects real-time wearable health data, normalizes it, and uses AI to analyze trends and risk scores. It detects anomalies by comparing with historical patterns and automatically triggers alerts and follow-up actions when thresholds are exceeded.

## Setup Steps
1. **Configure Webhook Endpoint** - Set up webhook to receive data from wearable devices
2. **Connect Database** - Initialize storage for health metrics and historical data
3. **Set Normalization Rules** - Define data standardization parameters for different devices
4. **Configure AI Model** - Set up health score calculation and risk prediction algorithms
5. **Define Thresholds** - Establish alert triggers for critical health metrics
6. **Connect Notification Channels** - Configure email and Slack integrations
7. **Set Up Reporting** - Create automated report templates and schedules
8. **Test Workflow** - Run end-to-end tests with sample health data

## Workflow Template
Webhook → Store Database → Normalize Data → Calculate Health Score → Analyze Metrics → Compare Previous → Check Threshold → Generate Reports/Alerts → Email/Slack → Schedule Follow-up


## Workflow Steps
Ingest real-time wearable data via webhook, store and standardize it, and use GPT-4 for trend analysis and risk scoring. Monitor metrics against thresholds, trigger SMS, email, or Slack alerts, generate reports, and schedule follow-ups.

## Setup Instructions
Configure webhook, database, GPT-4 API, notifications, calendar integration, and customize alert thresholds.

## Prerequisites
Wearable API, patient database, GPT-4 key, email SMTP, optional Slack/Twilio, calendar integration.

## Use Cases
Monitor glucose for diabetics, track elderly vitals/fall risk, assess corporate wellness, and post-surgery recovery alerts.

## Customization
Adjust risk algorithms, add metrics, integrate telemedicine.

## Benefits
Early intervention reduces readmissions and automates 80% of monitoring tasks.
