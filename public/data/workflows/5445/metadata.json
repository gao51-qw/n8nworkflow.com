  "description": "## What it does\nThis workflow automatically creates and publishes engaging blog posts for products in your WooCommerce store using OpenAI.  \nEvery 6 hours (schedule adjustable), it randomly selects a product from your store, generates a fun, curiosity-driven post, formats it for WordPress, and publishes it — all without manual intervention.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Schedule Trigger** – Runs on a set interval (default: every 6 hours).  \n2. **Pull WooCommerce Products** – Uses the WooCommerce REST API to retrieve up to 100 products.  \n3. **Sort Randomly & Select One** – Ensures variety by picking a different product each run.  \n4. **OpenAI Blog Post Generation** – Sends the product link and a creative prompt to GPT-4.1-mini for a casual, shareable blog post.  \n5. **Format Post** – Extracts title, content, slug, and excerpt from AI output.  \n6. **Publish to WordPress** – Posts directly via the WP REST API with your chosen category.\n\n## Key features\n- **Hands-off content creation** — Runs automatically on your schedule.  \n- **Unique, non-corporate tone** — Prompt crafted for casual, social-media-friendly style.  \n- **Product variety** — Randomized selection keeps posts fresh.  \n- **End-to-end automation** — From product data to live blog post in minutes.  \n- **Easy to customize** — Adjust prompt, schedule, categories, or post format.\n\n## Setup instructions\n1. **WooCommerce**\n   - Enable REST API and create a key with *Read* permissions.  \n   - Store your API key/secret in n8n as Basic Auth credentials.  \n   - Update the “Pull WooCommerce Product” URL to your store domain.\n\n2. **OpenAI**\n   - Add your API key in n8n’s OpenAI credentials.  \n   - Optionally adjust model or prompt for your tone/style.\n\n3. **WordPress**\n   - Enable REST API and create an Application Password or Basic Auth user with *Author* or higher permissions.  \n   - Add credentials to the “Publish to WordPress” node.  \n   - Update post category ID in the “Publish” node if needed.\n\n## Costs\n- **OpenAI:** per-token usage (GPT-4.1-mini is cost-efficient for blog-length content).  \n- **Hosting:** Your n8n instance, WooCommerce, and WordPress hosting costs.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- **No products retrieved:** Check WooCommerce API credentials and endpoint URL.  \n- **Post fails to publish:** Verify WordPress API credentials and category ID.  \n- **Formatting issues:** Adjust the “Format Post For Publishing” code node to tweak parsing.\n",
