# This free n8n automation helps anyone—from busy parents to entrepreneurs—get a daily SMS summary of their calendar events. It’s a personal assistant that gives you a heads up of what your day will look like.

Great for: starting your day cognizant of the day's events, or for the neurodivergent.

### Example use case:
Parent receives a text summarizing the Family Calendar events at 5AM. Its a reminder of a child's doctor appointment at 1PM and soccer practice at 430PM. The AI then ends the message on an uplifting note.

### Good to Know
- Requires user to buy a Twilio phone number to send SMS from. Each message, at the time of writing, is $0.083 CAD. 
- Requires basic knowledge of Google Cloud Console for the activation of Google Calendar API

## How it Works
1.  Every morning at 7AM, your workflow checks Google Calendar for the day’s events.
2. It formats your schedule into a friendly, easy-to-read summary using your favorite AI model (any LLM works—Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc).
3. That summary is texted directly to your phone via Twilio as a personal daily reminder.

## How to Use
- Copy this n8n workflow into your own instance.
- Hook up your Google Calendar and Twilio accounts. You can choose the specific calendar in the Calendar node.
- Choose or swap in any AI model you prefer to personalize your summaries. I find Claude sounds the most natural.

#### Enjoy your daily, cheerful calendar digest by SMS at 7AM!

## Requirements
- A Google Cloud account (to activate the Calendar API and get credentials—see Google documentation).
- Twilio account (for sending SMS—get started with Twilio’s easy setup).
- Any LLM API account (optional, but recommended for polite/friendly summaries).

## Customize this flow
- Change SMS times to fit your morning routine.
- Adjust message formatting for your style or brand.
- Swap LLM services, tweak prompts, or combine multiple calendars—whatever works for you.
