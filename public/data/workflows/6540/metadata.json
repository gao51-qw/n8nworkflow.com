  "description": "## 🤖 Automated SEO Audit with a Team of AI Specialists\n\nThis workflow performs a comprehensive, automated monthly SEO and performance audit for any website. It uses a \"team\" of specialized AI agents to analyze data from multiple sources, aggregates their findings, and generates a final strategic report.\n\nEvery month, it automatically fetches data from **Google Analytics**, **Google Search Console**, and **Google PageSpeed Insights**, and also performs a live crawl of the target website's homepage.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Fully Automated**: Runs on a schedule to deliver monthly reports without manual intervention.\n- **Multi-Source Analysis**: Gathers data from four key marketing sources for a 360° view.\n- **AI Agent Team**: Uses a sophisticated multi-agent system where each AI specializes in one area (Analytics, Performance, Technical SEO).\n- **Master Analyst**: A final AI agent synthesizes all specialist reports into a single, actionable strategic plan.\n- **Automated Storage**: All individual and final reports are automatically saved to a designated Google Sheet.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\nTo use this template, you must configure your credentials and set your target website.\n\n**1. Set Your Target Domain (Crucial!)**:\n*   Find the **`Set Target Website`** node at the beginning of the workflow.\n*   In the \"Value\" field, replace `https://www.your-website.com` with the URL of the website you want to audit. This will update the URL across the entire workflow automatically.\n\n**2. Configure the `Schedule Trigger`**:\n*   Click on the `Schedule Trigger` node to set when you want the monthly report to run.\n\n**3. Connect Your Google Credentials**:\n*   **Google Analytics**: Select your credential in the `Get a report` node.\n*   **Google Search Console**: Select your credential in the `Search Console` (HTTP Request) node.\n*   **Google Sheets**: Select your credential in *all* `Google Sheets` nodes.\n*   **Google PageSpeed API Key**:\n    *   Go to the \"Credentials\" tab in n8n and create a new **\"Generic Credential\"** with the type **\"API Key - Query Param\"**.\n    *   Name it `Google API Key`.\n    *   The \"Parameter Name\" must be `key`.\n    *   Paste your PageSpeed API key into the \"API Key\" field.\n    *   Go back to the **`PageSpeed Insight`** node, select \"API Key - Query Param\" for Authentication, and choose your new credential.\n\n**4. Connect OpenAI Credentials**:\n*   This template uses multiple `OpenAI Chat Model` nodes. Configure each one with your OpenAI API key.\n\n**5. Set Your Google Sheet**:\n*   In each of the `Google Sheets` nodes, replace the hardcoded \"Document ID\" with the ID of your own Google Sheet where you want to store the reports.\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 Workflow Explained\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Data Collection**: The `Schedule Trigger` starts the workflow. Four parallel branches collect data from Google Analytics, PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, and a direct website crawl.\n2.  **Phase 2: Data Processing & Specialist Analysis**:\n    *   Each data source is processed by a dedicated `Code` node to format the data.\n    *   The formatted data is then sent to a specialized AI agent (`ANALYTICS SPECIALIST`, `PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST`, etc.) for in-depth analysis.\n3.  **Phase 3: Report Aggregation**: A `Merge` node waits for all four specialist reports to be completed. A `DATA AGGREGATOR` node then combines them into a single, comprehensive package.\n4.  **Phase 4: Master Synthesis & Storage**: The final `MASTER ANALYST` agent receives the aggregated data and produces a high-level strategic summary with actionable recommendations. This final report is then saved to Google Sheets.\n",
