## 🤖 Automated SEO Audit with a Team of AI Specialists

This workflow performs a comprehensive, automated monthly SEO and performance audit for any website. It uses a "team" of specialized AI agents to analyze data from multiple sources, aggregates their findings, and generates a final strategic report.

Every month, it automatically fetches data from **Google Analytics**, **Google Search Console**, and **Google PageSpeed Insights**, and also performs a live crawl of the target website's homepage.

### Key Features
- **Fully Automated**: Runs on a schedule to deliver monthly reports without manual intervention.
- **Multi-Source Analysis**: Gathers data from four key marketing sources for a 360° view.
- **AI Agent Team**: Uses a sophisticated multi-agent system where each AI specializes in one area (Analytics, Performance, Technical SEO).
- **Master Analyst**: A final AI agent synthesizes all specialist reports into a single, actionable strategic plan.
- **Automated Storage**: All individual and final reports are automatically saved to a designated Google Sheet.

*   **Google Sheets**: Select your credential in *all* `Google Sheets` nodes.
*   **Google PageSpeed API Key**:
    *   Go to the "Credentials" tab in n8n and create a new **"Generic Credential"** with the type **"API Key - Query Param"**.
    *   Name it `Google API Key`.
    *   The "Parameter Name" must be `key`.
    *   Paste your PageSpeed API key into the "API Key" field.

## 🔬 Workflow Explained

1.  **Phase 1: Data Collection**: The `Schedule Trigger` starts the workflow. Four parallel branches collect data from Google Analytics, PageSpeed Insights, Search Console, and a direct website crawl.
2.  **Phase 2: Data Processing & Specialist Analysis**:
    *   Each data source is processed by a dedicated `Code` node to format the data.
    *   The formatted data is then sent to a specialized AI agent (`ANALYTICS SPECIALIST`, `PERFORMANCE SPECIALIST`, etc.) for in-depth analysis.
3.  **Phase 3: Report Aggregation**: A `Merge` node waits for all four specialist reports to be completed. A `DATA AGGREGATOR` node then combines them into a single, comprehensive package.
4.  **Phase 4: Master Synthesis & Storage**: The final `MASTER ANALYST` agent receives the aggregated data and produces a high-level strategic summary with actionable recommendations. This final report is then saved to Google Sheets.
