  "description": "WP Category Toolkit automates mapping content topics to your WordPress category IDs using your WordPress REST API and a GPT-5mini model.  \n\n![Screenshot 20250810 at 10.51.28.png](fileId:2012)\n\nIt replaces manual copy-paste and guesswork when assigning categories, speeds up publishing, and reduces tagging errors so your site stays organized and search friendly without you learning new dev magic (just a bit of prompt craft).\n\n\n## 💡 Why Use WP Category Toolkit?\n\n- **Saves time:** Cuts hours of manual category lookup and mapping—deploy batches of posts in minutes, not coffee breaks.  \n- **Stops messy tagging:** Eliminates inconsistent category assignments so your archive and SEO behave themselves.  \n- **Measurable improvement:** Expect faster publish cycles and fewer category fixes (reduce manual mapping errors by ~90%).  \n- **Competitive edge:** Uses an LLM to interpret topic intent, so your categories align with content meaning, not guesswork—like having a librarian who understands your jokes.\n\n## ⚡ Perfect For\n\n- **Content Managers:** Keep large WordPress catalogs neat without the spreadsheet gymnastics.  \n- **Agencies:** Onboard client sites faster by automating taxonomy mapping across projects.  \n- **Developers & Automators:** Add an LLM-powered mapping step to content pipelines without building custom classifiers.\n\n\n## 🔧 How It Works\n\n1. **⏱ Trigger:** Manual start (kick it off when you’re ready to map categories).  \n2. **📎 Process:** Pull all site categories from your WordPress REST endpoint, aggregate the list, and feed the source content + current topic into the mapping step.  \n3. **🤖 Smart Logic:** A Chain LLM node (**Category-Mapping**) uses a small prompt to decide which WordPress category IDs match the content topic (GPT5-mini handles the reasoning).  \n4. **💌 Output:** A clean category ID mapping you can paste into your Body Post WordPress node or use to patch posts automatically.  \n\n\n## 🔐 Quick Setup\n\n1. **Import** JSON file to your n8n instances → [n8n Import Link](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)  \n2. **Add credentials:** WordPress API credential & Azure OpenAI (GPT5-mini) credential or you can use usual open AI node \n3. **Update:** Replace the WP endpoint URLand any post-body endpoints you’ll write back to  \n5. **Test:** Run with a sample post and copy the output mapping into your Body Post WordPress node to confirm IDs match expected categories\n\n\n## 🧩 You'll Need\n\n- Active n8n instances → [n8n Partner Link](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)  \n- WordPress REST API access and credentials (`wp-json` access)  \n- Azure OpenAI account with access to GPT5-mini  \n- Integrations: WordPress API node, Chain LLM / Azure OpenAI node  \n- *(Optional)* Staging WordPress site to test mappings safely\n\n\n\n## 🛠️ Level Up Ideas\n\n- Auto-write category descriptions based on mapped content using the LLM. *(It’ll sound smarter than your coffee.)*  \n- Patch posts automatically after mapping so mapping becomes truly zero-touch.  \n- Add fallback heuristics: if the LLM is uncertain, route to a Slack/Microsoft Teams approval step.\n\nMade by: **[Khairul](https://khmuhtadin.com)**  \nTags: WordPress, Categories, AI, n8n  \nCategory: WordPress  \nNeed custom work? **[Contact me](https://khmuhtadin.com/contact)**\n \n",
