## Enhance Query Resolution with the Knowledge Base Tool!

Our **KB Tool - Confluence KB** is crafted to seamlessly integrate into the IT Ops AI SlackBot Workflow, enhancing the IT support process by enabling sophisticated search and response capabilities via Slack.

## Workflow Functionality:
- **Receive Queries**: Directly accepts user queries from the main workflow, initiating a dynamic search process.
- **AI-Powered Query Transformation**: Utilizes OpenAI's models or local ai to refine user queries into searchable keywords that are most likely to retrieve relevant information from the Knowledge Base.
- **Confluence Integration**: Executes searches within Confluence using the refined keywords to find the most applicable articles and information.
- **Deliver Accurate Responses**: Gathers essential details from the Confluence results, including article titles, links, and summaries, preparing them to be sent back to the parent workflow for final user response.
