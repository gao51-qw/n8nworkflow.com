### How It Works  
1. **Form Submission Handling**: The workflow starts with a WordPress form submission captured via a webhook. The form data (first name, last name, email, phone, and message) is extracted and structured using the "Set Fields" node.  
2. **Message Classification**: The submitted message is classified into predefined categories (e.g., "Product Info," "Order Info," or "Other") using the "Message Classifier" node, powered by Google Gemini.  
3. **Automated Email Drafting**: Based on the classification, the workflow generates a professional email draft using one of three "Email Writer" nodes (for Product, Order, or Other requests). Each node uses Google Gemini to craft a personalized response with a structured format (subject and body).  
4. **Email Draft Creation**: The drafted email is sent as a Gmail draft to the appropriate department, including the original form data for context.  
5. **Data Logging**: All submissions, along with their classifications and email drafts, are logged in a Google Sheets spreadsheet for record-keeping and further action.

### Set Up Steps  
1. **Install WordPress Plugin**: Install the "CF7 to Webhook" plugin on WordPress and configure it to send form submissions to the n8n webhook URL.  
2. **Configure Webhook in n8n**: Set up the "From Wordpress" webhook node in n8n to receive POST requests from the WordPress form.  
3. **Google Gemini Integration**: Ensure the Google Gemini nodes are properly authenticated with the correct API credentials.  
4. **Gmail and Google Sheets Setup**: Authenticate the Gmail and Google Sheets nodes with the appropriate OAuth2 credentials and specify the target spreadsheet and sheet name.  
5. **Customize Classification Categories**: Adjust the categories in the "Message Classifier" node to match your business needs.  
6. **Test the Workflow**: Trigger a test form submission to verify the workflow processes data correctly, classifies the message, generates an email draft, and logs the data.
