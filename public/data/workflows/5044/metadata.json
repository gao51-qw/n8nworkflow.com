  "description": "# Overview\nThe n8n Telegram Gmail Assistant is an intelligent workflow that lets you search and retrieve specific Gmail emails simply by messaging a Telegram bot. Powered by advanced language models, it turns plain-language requests into precise Gmail searches, delivering results directly to your Telegram chat. This no-code automation is perfect for users who want instant, conversational access to their inbox—no Gmail tab required.\n\n## Key Features\n**Conversational Email Search:** Just message the Telegram bot with requests like “Get me all emails from Amazon” or “Show unread emails after 6 June 2025.” The assistant understands sender names, keywords, and date filters—even if you only provide part of the information.\n\n**AI-Powered Query Parsing:** Uses a language model (LLM) to intelligently extract sender, keywords, and date range from your message, then builds an accurate Gmail search query.\n\n**Flexible Filtering:** Supports sender, keywords, ‘after’ and ‘before’ dates, or any combination. Handles both specific and broad queries.\n\n**Instant Telegram Delivery:** Each matching email is formatted with date, sender, subject, and a snippet, and sent as a separate Telegram message for easy reading.\n\n**Customizable & Extendable:** Swap the AI model (Google Gemini or OpenAI), adjust output formatting, and set email limits or read status as needed.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **User Sends a Telegram Message:** For example, “Get unread emails from Amazon about invoices after 1 June 2025.”\n2. **AI Interprets the Request:** The workflow’s LLM agent extracts sender, keywords, and date filters, converting them into a Gmail search query using Gmail’s syntax (e.g., from:amazon AND (invoice OR invoices) AND after:2025/06/01).\n3. **Gmail Search:** The workflow fetches all matching emails from your connected Gmail account.\n4. **Message Formatting:** Each email is summarized into a concise, emoji-rich Telegram message (date, sender, subject, snippet).\n5. **Telegram Delivery:** Results are sent to your Telegram chat, one message per email.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. **Create a Telegram Bot:** Use @BotFather on Telegram to create a bot and obtain the API token.\n2. **Connect Telegram to n8n:** Add your bot’s API token as a credential in n8n.\n3. **Connect Gmail Account:** Authorize your Gmail account in n8n, set email limits, and choose read/unread status preferences.\n4. **Configure AI Model:** Use your own Google Gemini or OpenAI API key, or select a preferred LLM node in the workflow.\n5. **Deploy the Workflow:** Activate the workflow and start messaging your Telegram bot to retrieve emails instantly.\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n- **Save Time:** No need to open Gmail or remember search operators—just ask in plain language.\n- **Stay Organized:** Instantly filter and retrieve important emails, even on the go.\n- **User-Friendly:** No coding required, with clear setup steps and customizable options.\n- **Cost-Effective:** Available simply with an n8n subscription—no extra costs or hidden fees of anything. Enjoy the workflow Free Forever within your n8n plan.",
