  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nGrowth marketers, community managers, and personal-brand builders who want to steadily grow their Twitter (X) network by following new, relevant accounts on autopilot—while respecting daily limits.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** fires every hour at a specified minute.  \n2. **Select Cookie** picks a rotating Twitter session-cookie based on time slices.  \n3. **AI Agent** creates a realistic AI/BPA hashtag.  \n4. **Phantombuster Hashtag Agent** scrapes recent tweets → extracts profile handles.  \n5. **Set Item** builds a small CSV with one profile; **Launch AF Agent** instructs the Phantombuster Auto-follow agent to follow it.  \n6. Rate-limit nodes cap follows to roughly 50-80 per day.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  \n   • `twitter_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n3. Adjust schedule or search parameters as needed.  \n4. Activate the workflow; it will run hourly and follow 1 new profile each launch.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- OpenAI account \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Change niche: edit hashtag prompt in **AI Agent**.  \n- Follow more accounts: raise `numberOfAddsPerLaunch` and schedule frequency.  \n- Use Google Drive/Dropbox instead of SharePoint: swap the cookie download node.",
