## Who’s it for  
Growth marketers, community managers, and personal-brand builders who want to steadily grow their Twitter (X) network by following new, relevant accounts on autopilot—while respecting daily limits.

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Schedule Trigger** fires every hour at a specified minute.  
2. **Select Cookie** picks a rotating Twitter session-cookie based on time slices.  
3. **AI Agent** creates a realistic AI/BPA hashtag.  
4. **Phantombuster Hashtag Agent** scrapes recent tweets → extracts profile handles.  
5. **Set Item** builds a small CSV with one profile; **Launch AF Agent** instructs the Phantombuster Auto-follow agent to follow it.  
6. Rate-limit nodes cap follows to roughly 50-80 per day.

## How to set up  
1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  
2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  
   • `twitter_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  
3. Adjust schedule or search parameters as needed.  
4. Activate the workflow; it will run hourly and follow 1 new profile each launch.

## Requirements  
- n8n 1.33 +  
- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  
- OpenAI account 
- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant

## How to customize  
- Change niche: edit hashtag prompt in **AI Agent**.  
- Follow more accounts: raise `numberOfAddsPerLaunch` and schedule frequency.  
- Use Google Drive/Dropbox instead of SharePoint: swap the cookie download node.
