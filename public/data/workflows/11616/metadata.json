No manual follow-ups. Just leverage + timing.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How the Workflow Works\n\n---\n\n## 📋 PART 1 — Lead Capture & Instant Value\n\n### **1 — Share High-Impact AI Image Edits**\nYou post before/after examples using the **NanoBanna / Gemini image-editing model** on social platforms.  \nEach post includes a link to a lightweight form.\n\nThe visual results do the selling for you.\n\n---\n\n### **2 — Lead Submits Image & Details**\nThe form collects:\n- Image upload  \n- Edit instructions  \n- Name  \n- Email  \n- Company name  \n\nThis filters for **high-intent prospects only**.\n\n---\n\n### **3 — AI Edits the Image Instantly**\nOnce submitted, the workflow:\n- Sends the image + instructions to the AI image editor  \n- Preserves lighting and camera angle unless specified  \n- Generates a polished result in seconds  \n\n---\n\n### **4 — Result Delivered via Email**\nThe edited image is emailed directly to the user with:\n- A friendly confirmation message  \n- Soft positioning for future work  \n\nThis establishes trust before any sales motion happens.\n\n---\n\n### **5 — Lead Is Logged Automatically**\nAll lead data is saved to Google Sheets:\n- Name  \n- Company  \n- Email  \n- Timestamp  \n\nThis becomes your **live CRM of warm inbound leads**.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 PART 2 — AI-Driven Personalized Outreach\n\n### **6 — AI Analyzes the Lead**\nAn AI sales agent:\n- Looks at the company name + context  \n- Reviews a library of proven automation ideas  \n- Either selects the best fit **or creates a simple custom one**\n\n---\n\n### **7 — AI Writes a Personalized Outreach Email**\nThe agent generates a short email that:\n- Mentions a **specific automation already built**\n- States you can help implement it quickly\n- Invites them to book a call via your calendar\n\nNo marketing fluff. No generic pitches.  \nEvery email feels hand-written.\n\n---\n\n### **8 — Outreach Email Is Sent Automatically**\nThe email is sent from your inbox (Outlook, Gmail, SMTP, etc.) and includes:\n- Their name  \n- Their company  \n- A clear calendar booking link  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 PART 3 — Smart Follow-Up System\n\n### **9 — Wait 48 Hours**\nThe workflow pauses to give the lead time to respond naturally.\n\n---\n\n### **10 — Check for a Reply**\nAfter 48 hours:\n- If the lead replied → they are tagged as **Interested**\n- If no reply → continue to follow-up\n\n(Current reply detection is placeholder logic and can be swapped for a live inbox listener.)\n\n---\n\n### **11 — AI Writes a Polite Follow-Up**\nIf there’s no response, an AI agent writes:\n- A short, non-pushy follow-up  \n- Referencing the original automation idea  \n- Under 60 words  \n\n---\n\n### **12 — Follow-Up Email Is Sent**\nThe follow-up goes out automatically and keeps the conversation alive without manual effort.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Why This Workflow Converts So Well\n\n### **Instant Value First**\nLeads experience AI results before being pitched anything.\n\n### **Context-Aware Outreach**\nEvery email is personalized based on the lead, not a template.\n\n### **Built-In Persistence**\nThe system follows up automatically — no leads fall through the cracks.\n\n### **Fully Automated**\nOnce live, this workflow handles:\n- Lead capture  \n- AI delivery  \n- Outreach  \n- Follow-ups  \n- CRM updates  \n\nYou just keep posting content.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup Requirements\n\nTo deploy this workflow, connect:\n\n- **Google Gemini API** (image editing + agents)  \n- **Email provider**\n  - Outlook  \n  - Gmail  \n  - SMTP  \n- **Google Sheets**\n  - Columns: Name, Company, Email, Time, Status  \n- **Calendar booking link**\n  - Example: `https://cal.com/your-link`\n\nAll credentials are modular and easily swappable.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Summary\n\nThis n8n automation turns attention into action by:\n1. Delivering immediate AI value  \n2. Following up with relevant, personalized ideas  \n3. Nudging leads toward a booked call — automatically  \n\nIt’s not just a lead funnel.  \nIt’s an **AI sales assistant that runs 24/7**.\n",
