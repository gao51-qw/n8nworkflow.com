# Trello Task-Sync Assistant

## Description

This n8n workflow automates task management by integrating Trello, Supabase, and Telegram to streamline card creation, user assignment, and due date notifications. It ensures seamless synchronization of Trello card data with a Supabase database and sends timely Telegram notifications to keep team members informed about task assignments and deadlines.

### Key Features
- **Trello Card Syncing**: Automatically registers new Trello cards in Supabase and keeps card details (e.g., due dates, URLs) updated.
- **User Management**: Tracks Trello user assignments in Supabase, creating new user entries and linking them to cards as needed.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Sends Telegram messages when users are added to or removed from Trello cards, using dynamic, engaging message templates.
- **Due Date Reminders**: Schedules daily checks to notify users via Telegram about tasks due on the current day.

### Workflow Structure

1. **Trello Trigger Flow**:
   - **Trigger**: Activates when a new Trello card is created.
   - **Actions**:
     - Registers the card in Supabase (`cards` table) with details like ID, name, and board.
     - Sets up a Trello webhook for real-time updates on the card.
     - Syncs due date changes to Supabase.
     - Detects member additions/removals, checks for existing users in Supabase, creates new user entries if needed, and links users to cards in the `card_user` table.

2. **Webhook Event Flow**:
   - **Trigger**: Processes Trello webhook events (e.g., member changes, due date updates).
   - **Actions**:
     - Validates event types (add/remove member).
     - Maps Trello usernames to Telegram handles.
     - Sends formatted Telegram notifications with card details and playful, randomized messages for engagement.

3. **Due-Date Notification Flow**:
   - **Trigger**: Runs twice daily (every 12 hours) via a scheduled trigger.
   - **Actions**:
     - Fetches cards due on the current day from Supabase.
     - Retrieves assigned users for each card.
     - Sends Telegram reminders with urgent, formatted messages including card name, board, URL, and due date.

### Technical Details

### Use Case
