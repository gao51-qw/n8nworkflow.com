## How it Works ##

This workflow fetches top news headlines every 10 minutes from NewsAPI, summarizes them using OpenAI's GPT-4o model, and sends a concise email digest to a list of recipients defined in a Google Spreadsheet. It's ideal for anyone who wants to stay updated with the latest news in a short, digestible format.

## 🎯 Use Case ##
