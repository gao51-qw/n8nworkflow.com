  "description": "***Tags**: AI Agent, MCP Server, n8n API, Monitoring, Debugging, Workflow Analytics, Automation*\n\n### Context\n\nHi! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).\n\nThis workflow is part of my latest project: an **AI assistant that automatically analyses n8n workflow executions, detects failures, and identifies root causes** through natural conversation with Claude Desktop.\n\n[![Concept](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-2.png)](https://youtu.be/oJzNnHIusZs)\n\n&gt; Turn your automation logs into intelligent conversations with an AI that understands your workflows.\n\nThe idea is to use *Claude Desktop* to help monitor and debug your workflows deployed in production.\n\nThe workflow shared here is part of the setup.\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis template is designed for **automation engineers**, **data professionals**, and **AI enthusiasts** who manage multiple workflows in **n8n** and want a smarter way to track errors or performance without manually browsing execution logs.\n\nIf you’ve ever discovered a failed workflow hours after it happened — this is for you.\n\n\n### What does this workflow do?\n\nThis workflow acts as the **bridge** between your n8n instance and the **Claude MCP Server**.\n\n[![Principle](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-1.png)](https://youtu.be/oJzNnHIusZs)\n\nIt exposes three main routes that can be triggered via a webhook:\n\n1. `get_active_workflows` → Fetches all currently active workflows  \n2. `get_workflow_executions` → Retrieves the latest executions and calculates health KPIs  \n3. `get_execution_details` → Extracts detailed information about failed executions for debugging  \n\nEach request is automatically routed and processed, providing Claude with structured execution data for real-time analysis.\n\n### How does it fit in the overall setup?\n\nHere’s the complete architecture:\n```\nClaude Desktop ←→ \n   MCP Server ←→ \n      n8n Monitor Webhook ←→\n         n8n API\n```\n\n- The **MCP Server** (Python-based) communicates with your n8n instance through this workflow.  \n- The **Claude Desktop app** can then query workflow health, execution logs, and error patterns using natural language.  \n- The **n8n workflow** aggregates, cleans, and returns the relevant metrics (failures, success rates, timing, alerts).\n\n📘 The full concept and architecture are explained in my article published on my blog:  \n👉 [Deploy your AI Assistant to Monitor and Debug n8n Workflows using Claude and MCP](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-your-ai-assistant-to-monitor-and-debug-n8n-workflows-using-claude-and-mcp)\n\n### 🎥 Tutorial\n\nThe full setup tutorial (with source code and demo) is available on YouTube:\n\n[![Tutorial + Demo](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/temp-8.png)](https://youtu.be/oJzNnHIusZs)\n\n### How does it work?\n\n- 🌐 Webhook Trigger receives the MCP server requests  \n- 🔀 Switch node routes actions based on `\"action\"` parameter  \n- ⚙️ HTTP Request nodes fetch execution and workflow data via the n8n API  \n- 🧮 A Code node calculates KPIs (success/failure rates, timing, alerts)  \n- 📤 The processed results are returned as JSON for Claude to interpret\n\n### Example use cases\n\nOnce connected, you can ask Claude questions like:\n- “Show me all workflows that failed in the last 25 executions.”  \n- “Why is my `Bangkok Meetup Scraper` workflow failing?”  \n- “Give me a health report of my n8n instance.”  \n\n[![Example](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-3.png)](https://youtu.be/oJzNnHIusZs)\n\nClaude will reply with structured insights, including failure patterns, node diagnostics, and health status indicators (🟢🟡🔴).\n\n### What do I need to get started?\n\nYou’ll need:\n- A **self-hosted n8n instance**\n- **Claude Desktop** app installed\n- The **MCP server source code** (shared in the tutorial description)\n- The **webhook URL** from this workflow is configured in your `.env` file  \n\nFollow the tutorial for more details, don't hesitate to leave your questions in the comment section.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n🗒️ Use the sticky notes inside the workflow to:\n- Replace &lt;YOUR_N8N_INSTANCE&gt; with your own URL  \n- Test the webhook routes individually using the “Execute Workflow” button  \n- Connect the MCP server and Claude Desktop to start monitoring  \n\n*This template was built using n8n v.116.2*  \n*Submitted: November 2025*\n\n\n",
