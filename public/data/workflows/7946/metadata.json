  "description": "## Evaluate Hybrid Search on Legal Dataset\n*This is the second part of **\"Hybrid Search with Qdrant & n8n, Legal AI.\"**\nThe first part, [**\"Indexing\"**](https://n8n.io/workflows/7945-hybrid-search-with-qdrant-and-n8n-legal-ai-indexing/), covers preparing and uploading the dataset to Qdrant.*\n\n### Overview\nThis pipeline demonstrates how to perform **Hybrid Search** on a [Qdrant collection](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/#collections) using questions and text chunks (containing answers) from the  \n[LegalQAEval dataset (isaacus)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/isaacus/LegalQAEval).\n\nOn a small subset of questions, it shows:  \n- How to set up hybrid retrieval in Qdrant with:  \n  - [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)-based keyword retrieval;\n  - [mxbai-embed-large-v1](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1) semantic retrieval;  \n  - **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**, a simple zero-shot fusion of the two searches;\n- How to run a basic evaluation:  \n  - Calculate **hits@1** — the percentage of evaluation questions where the top-1 retrieved text chunk contains the correct answer  \n\n\nAfter running this pipeline, you will have a quality estimate of a simple hybrid retrieval setup.  \nFrom there, you can reuse Qdrant’s **Query Points** node to build a **legal RAG chatbot**.  \n\n### Embedding Inference\n- By default, this pipeline uses [**Qdrant Cloud Inference**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/inference/) to convert questions to embeddings.  \n- You can also use an **external embedding provider** (e.g. OpenAI).  \n  - In that case, minimally update the pipeline, similar to the adjustments showed in **Part 1: Indexing**.  \n\n### Prerequisites\n- **Completed Part 1 pipeline**, *\"Hybrid Search with Qdrant & n8n, Legal AI: Indexing\"*, and the collection created in it;\n- All the requirements of **Part 1 pipeline**;\n\n### Hybrid Search\nThe example here is a **basic hybrid query**. You can extend/enhance it with:\n- Reranking strategies;  \n- Different fusion techniques;\n- Score boosting based on metadata;\n- ...  \n\nMore details: [Hybrid Queries in Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/).  \n\n#### P.S.\n- To ask retrieval in Qdrant-related questions, join the [Qdrant Discord](https://discord.gg/ArVgNHV6).  \n- Star [Qdrant n8n community node repo](https://github.com/qdrant/n8n-nodes-qdrant) &lt;3\n",
