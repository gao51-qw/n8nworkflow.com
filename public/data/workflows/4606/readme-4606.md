# Automate travel agent outreach with web scraping, OpenAI, and Google Sheets

> 🔧 Automated Workflow: Scrape Travel Agent Contacts and Send Personalized Survey Emails
This workflow is designed to automate the process of scraping travel agent contact data, standardizing the information, storing it, and then sending out personalized survey emails using AI. It’s especially useful for outreach campaigns, research, or lead generation.

⚙️ Workflow Breakdown
📍 Part 1: Scraping and Storing Travel Agent Data
1. HTTP Scrape Website
Type: HTTP Request (POST)

Function: Calls a third-party scraping API (https://api.firecrawl.dev...) to scrape data from a travel agent listing site.

Purpose: Extract raw HTML or structured data from a website containing contact info.

2. OpenAI Standardise Data
Type: OpenAI Message Model

Function: Uses AI to clean and standardize the raw scraped data into structured JSON (e.g., name, email, agency, location).

Purpose: Ensures uniformity in formatting, making data easier to process downstream.

3. Split Out
Type: Item Splitter

Function: Splits the standardized array of agent records into individual items.

Purpose: Allows appending each agent as a separate row in Google Sheets.

4. Google Sheet - Data Store
Type: Google Sheets (Append)

Function: Stores each individual record in a spreadsheet.

Purpose: Maintains a centralized and accessible log of scraped and processed contacts.

📍 Part 2: Read Records and Send Personalized Survey Emails
Triggered Manually – when “Test Workflow” button is clicked.

1. Trigger – When clicking 'Test workflow'
Type: Manual Trigger

Function: Starts the second part of the workflow manually.

Use Case: Testing or running the outreach email process on demand.

2. Google Sheet Data Store (Read)
Type: Google Sheets (Read)

Function: Reads the stored travel agent records from the spreadsheet.

Purpose: Retrieves contact details and context for personalized messaging.

3. OpenAI Mail Composer
Type: OpenAI Message Model

Function: Generates a custom email for each agent using their details.

Purpose: Creates human-like, engaging emails that include a survey link (optional input).

4. Google Sheet Update Records
Type: Google Sheets (Update)

Function: Optionally marks the record as "emailed" or logs the date of outreach.

Purpose: Prevents duplicate outreach and helps track campaign status.

5. Send Email
Type: Email Node (SMTP or integrated service)

Function: Sends the personalized email generated by OpenAI.

Purpose: Delivers the survey to each travel agent with contextually relevant messaging.

🧠 Use Case:
