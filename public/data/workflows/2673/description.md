## What this workflow does
This workflow retrieves Google Analytics data from the last 7 days and the same period in the previous year. The data is then prepared by AI as a table, analyzed and provided with a small summary.
The summary is then sent by email to a desired address and, shortened and summarized again, sent to a Telegram account.

This workflow has the following sequence:

1. time trigger (e.g. every Monday at 7 a.m.)
2. retrieval of Google Analytics data from the last 7 days
3. assignment and summary of the data
4. retrieval of Google Analytics data from the last 7 days of the previous year
5. allocation and summary of the data
6. preparation in tabular form and brief analysis by AI.
7. sending the report as an email
8. preparation in short form by AI for Telegram (optional)
9. sending as Telegram message.
