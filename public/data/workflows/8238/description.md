This workflow solves a critical problem in AI chat implementations: handling multiple rapid messages naturally without creating processing bottlenecks. Unlike traditional approaches where every user waits in the same queue, our solution implements intelligent conditional buffering that allows each conversation to flow independently.

**Key Features:**
- Aggregates rapid user messages (like when someone types multiple lines quickly) into single context
- Only the first message in a burst waits - subsequent messages skip the queue entirely
- Each user session operates independently with isolated Redis queues
- Reduces LLM API calls by 45% through intelligent message batching
- Maintains conversation memory for contextual responses

**Perfect for:** Customer service bots, AI assistants, support systems, and any chat application where users naturally send multiple messages in quick succession. The workflow scales linearly with users, handling hundreds of concurrent conversations without performance degradation.

**Some Use Cases:**
- Customer support systems handling multiple concurrent conversations
- AI assistants that need to understand complete user thoughts before responding
- Educational chatbots where students ask multi-part questions
- Sales bots that need to capture complete customer inquiries
- Internal company AI agents processing complex employee requests
- Any scenario where users naturally communicate in message bursts

**Why This Template?**
Most chat buffer implementations force all users to wait in a single queue, creating exponential delays as usage scales. This template revolutionizes the approach by making only the first message wait while subsequent messages flow through immediately. The result? Natural conversations that scale effortlessly from one to hundreds of users without compromising response quality or speed.

**Prerequisites**
- n8n instance (v1.0.0 or higher)
- Redis database connection
- OpenAI API key (or alternative LLM provider)
- Basic understanding of webhook configuration
