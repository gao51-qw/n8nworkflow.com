This n8n template lets you instantly serve batches of inspirational quotes via a webhook using the free ZenQuotes API. It’s perfect for developers, content creators, community managers, or educators who want to add dynamic, uplifting content to websites, chatbots, or internal tools—without writing custom backend code.

# 🔧 How it works
- A Webhook node listens for incoming HTTP requests on your chosen path.
- Get Random Quote from ZenQuotes sends an HTTP Request to https://zenquotes.io/api/random?count=5 and retrieves five random quotes.
- Format data uses a Set node to combine each quote (q) and author (a) into a single string:
"“quote” – author".
- Send response returns a JSON array of objects { quote, author } back to the caller.

- Developers building motivational Slack or Discord bots.

},

]
```
