## How It Works
This workflow automates multilingual audio content creation for content creators, educators, and marketing teams distributing materials globally. It solves the challenge of producing high-quality, translated audio content at scale without manual intervention. Starting with source text, the system translates content into English, Spanish, French, and German using AI translation services, validates translation quality through automated scoring, generates natural-sounding audio using ElevenLabs text-to-speech technology, calculates audio metrics for quality assurance, combines all language versions into a single package, uploads to Google Drive for centralized storage, and sends Slack notifications for team collaboration. The workflow eliminates weeks of manual translation and voice recording work while maintaining consistent quality across all language variants.

1. Configure AI translation service credentials for multilingual processing 
2. Add ElevenLabs API key and select voice models for each target language
