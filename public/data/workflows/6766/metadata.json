  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nCommunity managers, growth hackers, and brands that want to grow their\nInstagram audience by automatically following new, relevant profiles—\nwhile respecting daily limits.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs hourly at a specified minute.  \n2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating Instagram session-cookie (time-slice logic).  \n3. **Get List of Accounts** downloads a CSV of seed profiles from SharePoint.  \n4. **Follower Collector Agent** (Phantombuster) fetches each seed\n   profile’s followers (limit set by `ENV_AMOUNT_FOLLOWERS_PER_PROFILE`).  \n5. **Autofollow Agent** follows up to `ENV_PROFILES_TO_PROCESS` of those\n   followers per launch.  \n6. **Wait** nodes pause between Phantombuster calls and poll until each\n   run is complete.  \n7. Rate-limit configuration keeps follows between 1 and 40 per hour.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, (optional) OpenAI API key if you later add AI.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder add:  \n   • `instagram_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n   • `accounts_to_follow.csv` – header `profileUrl`, one seed profile per line.  \n3. Update **Set ENV Variables** to control profiles/launch and followers/profile.  \n4. Adjust schedule frequency or Wait durations to meet your plan limits.  \n5. Activate the workflow; it will follow new profiles every hour.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Scrape hashtags instead of followers: replace the Follower Collector\n  agent with a Hashtag‐to‐Profiles agent.  \n- Increase speed: raise `ENV_PROFILES_TO_PROCESS` and cron frequency\n  (ensure you stay within Instagram limits).  \n- Swap SharePoint for Drive/Dropbox by replacing storage nodes.",
