# Automatic event creation in Google Calendar from Google Sheets data

> This workflow streamlines the process of creating events in Google Calendar using event data stored in a Google Sheet.

The process begins by retrieving the latest event entry from Google Sheets, ensuring only the most recent event details are processed. Once fetched, a Function node formats the event date to align with Google Calendar's required format—ensuring consistency and preventing date-related errors.

After formatting, the structured event details are sent to Google Calendar, where an event is created with essential information such as the event title (summary), description, date, and location. Additionally, the workflow allows customization by setting the event's status as either "Busy" or "Available," helping attendees manage their schedules. A background color can also be assigned for better visibility and categorization.

By automating this process, you eliminate the need for manual event creation, ensuring seamless synchronization between Google Sheets and Google Calendar. This improves efficiency, accuracy, and productivity, making event management effortless.
