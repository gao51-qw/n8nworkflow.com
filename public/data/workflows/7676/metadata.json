  "description": "# Automatically Import Research Papers using DOI URL from Telegram to Zotero\n\nThis workflow allows you to automatically import research papers into your Zotero library by simply sending a DOI link through Telegram. It fetches metadata from reliable sources such as Crossref, DataCite, and Unpaywall, enriches the bibliographic details, attaches the best available full-text PDF when possible, and generates a concise summary of the abstract using an LLM before sending it back to Telegram.  \n\n## ✨ Key Features  \n- **Telegram Integration** – Send a DOI link via Telegram bot to trigger the workflow.  \n- **DOI Parsing** – Automatically detects and extracts DOI or arXiv identifiers from user messages.  \n- **Metadata Fetching** – Retrieves bibliographic information from **Crossref**, **DataCite**, and **Unpaywall**.  \n- **Smart PDF Finder** – Locates the best available PDF (publisher link, open access, or arXiv).  \n- **Zotero Integration** – Creates a Zotero parent item with complete metadata and attaches the PDF link when available.  \n- **Abstract Summarization** – Uses a basic LLM chain to generate a short and clear summary of the abstract.  \n- **Telegram Feedback** – Sends the title, URL, and abstract summary back to the user in Telegram.  \n\n\n## 🔑 Required Credentials  \n- **Telegram API** – To connect the workflow with your Telegram bot.  \n- **Zotero API Key** – To create and update items in your Zotero library.  \n- **OpenRouter API Key** – To enable the LLM for generating abstract summaries.  \n- *(Optional)* Email for **Unpaywall API** requests (recommended for stable access).  \n\n## 💡 Benefits  \n- Save time by automating manual research paper imports.  \n- Ensure high-quality metadata by combining multiple sources (Crossref, DataCite, Unpaywall).  \n- Get instant summaries of abstracts directly in Telegram for quick understanding.  \n- Keep your Zotero library organized with accurate titles, abstracts, authors, and tags.  \n- Quickly attach available full-text PDFs without manual searching.  \n- Improve your academic workflow by managing references and summaries directly from Telegram.  \n",
