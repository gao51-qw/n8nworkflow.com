## AI-Assisted Lead Follow-Up With Human Approval

This workflow automates your lead response process from end to end. When someone submits your n8n Form, the workflow generates an AI-written follow-up email, sends that draft to your sales team for approval, and then sends the approved email to the lead or marks it as needing revision. All lead details, drafts, approval decisions, and timestamps are stored in Airtable.
