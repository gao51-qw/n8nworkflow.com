This workflow turns Slack into your content control hub and automates the full blog creation pipeline — from sourcing trending headlines, validating topics, drafting posts, and preparing content for your CMS.

With one command in Slack, you can source news from RSS feeds, refine them with Gemini AI, generate high-quality blog posts, and get publish-ready output — all inside a single n8n workflow.

## ⚙️ How It Works
	**1.Trigger in Slack**

	Type start in a Slack channel to fetch trending headlines.
	Headlines are pulled from your configured RSS feeds.

	**2.Topic Generation (Gemini AI)**

	Gemini rewrites RSS headlines into unique, non-duplicate topics.
	Slack displays these topics in a numbered list (e.g., reply with 2 to pick topic 2).

	**3.Content Validation**
		When you reply with a number, Gemini validates and slightly rewrites the topic to ensure originality.
		Slack confirms the selected topic back to you.

	**4.Content Creation**
	
		Gemini generates a LinkedIn/blog-style draft:
		Strong hook introduction
		3–5 bullet insights
		A closing takeaway and CTA
		Optionally suggests asset ideas (e.g., image, infographic).

	**5.CMS-Ready Output**

	Final draft is structured for publishing (markdown or plain text).
	You can expand this workflow to automatically send the output to your CMS (WordPress, Ghost, Notion, etc.).
