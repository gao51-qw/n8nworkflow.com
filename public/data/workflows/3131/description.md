This workflow template is designed for dental assistants and anyone looking to automate appointment scheduling. It integrates Google Calendar for booking appointments and Google Sheets as a database to store patient information.

# How It Works

The user interacts with the chatbot to schedule an appointment.

The chatbot collects necessary details and checks availability via Google Calendar.
If the requested time is available, the AI books the appointment.

If unavailable, the AI suggests alternative time slots.

Once booked, the AI logs the appointment details into Google Sheets for record-keeping.
