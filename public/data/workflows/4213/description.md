This workflow listens for incoming WhatsApp messages that contain media (e.g., images) and automatically downloads the media file using WhatsApp's private media URL.

- The trigger node activates when a WhatsApp message with media is received.
- The media ID is extracted from the message payload.
- A private media URL is retrieved using the media ID.
- The media file is downloaded using an authenticated HTTP request.


Ideal for:
- Archiving WhatsApp media to external systems.
- Triggering further automations based on received media.
- Integrating with cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, or Amazon S3.


Set up steps
- Connect your WhatsApp Business API account.
- Add HTTP credentials for downloading media via private URL.
- Set up the webhook in your WhatsApp Business account.
- Extend the workflow as needed for your use case (e.g., file storage, alerts).
