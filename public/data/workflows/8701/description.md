## How it works

This workflow automatically captures website visitors using Albacross, enriches their data with Datagma, and syncs it into HubSpot. Once leads are created or updated, a personalized email is generated and sent through Gmail. All email activities are logged in HubSpot for proper sales tracking and follow-up.
