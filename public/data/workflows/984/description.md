**Lemlist Trigger:** The Lemlist Trigger node will trigger the workflow when a lead sends a reply to a campaign.

**Mattermost node:** This node will send a message to the `Leads` channel in Mattermost with the information about the reply. Based on your use-case, you may want to send the message to a different channel. You may even want to use a different service. Replace the node with the service where you want to send a message.
