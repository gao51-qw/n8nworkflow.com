  "description": "# **What It Does**\n\nThis workflow lets users create Google Calendar events through natural chat messages — no forms, no clicking around, just type like you're talking to a friend.\n\nFor example, you can say:\n\n“Lunch with John tomorrow at 12:30”\nand it’ll auto-create a calendar event with the correct title, time, and duration.\n\n# **How It Works**\n\nTrigger: Chat Message Received\nThe flow starts with a chat interface node (When chat message received) that listens for incoming user messages like:\n\n“Book dentist next Wed 10am”\n\n“Schedule Zoom call with Jane Friday 3–4pm”\n\nAI Agent with Scheduling Instructions\nThe message is handed off to a Langchain-powered AI Agent that:\n\nParses the message\n\nResolves relative time (like \"next Tuesday\") into actual ISO timestamps\n\nGenerates a title (summary) if not provided by the user\n\nEnsures all required fields are correctly filled\n\nHandles vague messages by asking a single clarifying question\n\nLLM (OpenAI)\nThe agent is powered by gpt-4o-mini (or your preferred OpenAI model). You can customize this or swap it out.\n\nGoogle Calendar Integration\nOnce the AI agent has structured the event details, it uses the Google Calendar Tool Node to create the event via your connected Google account.\n\n(Optional) A response node (Respond to Chat) is included (but currently disabled) — you can enable it to send a confirmation message back to the user like:\n\n“📅 Booked: Lunch with John on Aug 30 at 12:30 PM Asia/Manila.”\n\n\n# **Requirements**\n\nTo make this workflow functional, you need to connect:\n\n🔐 Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials\nAdd your Google account under Credentials &gt; Google Calendar OAuth2 API.\n\n🧠 OpenAI credentials\nProvide your OpenAI API key (used for message interpretation and slot filling).\n\n# **Customization Ideas**\n\nAdd email collection to invite attendees\n\nExpand to support recurring events\n\nAdd error handling or fallback if date parsing fails\n\nConnect to Slack or Telegram for real-time event booking\n\n# **Important Note on Credentials**\n\nThis template does not include any personal API keys or credential tokens. You’ll need to connect your own Google and OpenAI credentials after import.",
