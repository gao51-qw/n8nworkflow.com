What it is-
I wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use, MCP server for your Discord bot(s).

How to set up-
Literally all you do is select your bot auth (or crease a new Discord Bot auth if you havn't entered your key in n8n before) and that's IT!

How to use it-
You can now ask your bot to do things via any MCP client, including from within N8N workflows!

Note:
If you need an example, you can check out my simple quickstart Discord MCP Server that uses 4o to send messages to channels on your server and users who are members of the server the bot is in.

Need help? Want access to more workflows and even live Q&A sessions with a top verified n8n creator.. All 100% free?
