## Introduction
Automates flight deal discovery and intelligent analysis for travel bloggers and deal hunters. Scrapes live pricing, enriches with weather data, applies AI evaluation, and auto-publishes to WordPress—eliminating manual research and accelerating content delivery.

## How It Works
User submits route via form, scrapes real-time flight prices and weather data, AI analyzes deal quality considering weather conditions, formats results, publishes to WordPress, sends Slack notification—fully automated from input to publication.

## Workflow Template
Form Input → Extract Data → Scrape Flight Prices → Extract Pricing → Fetch Weather → Parse Weather → Prepare AI Input → AI Analysis → Parse Output → Format Results → Publish WordPress → Slack Alert → User Response

1. **Form Setup:** Configure user input fields for flight routes and preferences
2. **APIs:** Connect Google Flights scraping endpoint, weather API credentials, OpenAI/Chat Model API key
3. **Publishing:** Set WordPress credentials, target blog category, Slack webhook URL
4. **AI Configuration:** Define analysis prompts, output structure, parser rules

## Workflow Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Form captures route, scrapes Google Flights pricing, fetches destination weather via API
2. **AI Processing:** Enriches flight data with weather context, analyzes deal quality using OpenAI/Chat Model with structured output parsing
3. **Publishing:** Formats analysis results, creates WordPress post, sends Slack notification, delivers response to user
