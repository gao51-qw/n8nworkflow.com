## How It Works

1. **Telegram Bot Trigger**  
   - User sends a keyword (e.g., "Ethereum") of questions to the Telegram AI Agent.

2. **Keyword Extraction (AI-Powered)**  
   - An AI agent identifies the main topic for better targeting.

3. **News Aggregation**  
   - Pulls articles from 9 major crypto news RSS feeds:  
   
     - Cointelegraph  
     - Bitcoin Magazine  
     - CoinDesk  
     - Bitcoinist  
     - NewsBTC  
     - CryptoPotato  
     - 99Bitcoins  
     - CryptoBriefing  
     - Crypto.news  

4. **Filtering**  
   - Finds and merges articles relevant to the user's keyword.

5. **AI Summarization**  
   - **GPT-4o** generates a 3-part summary:
     1. News Summary  
     2. Market Sentiment Analysis  
     3. List of Article Links

6. **Telegram Response**  
   - Sends a structured, easy-to-read digest back to the user.
