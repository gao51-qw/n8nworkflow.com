  "description": "## ⚙️ How it works\n1. Workflow starts from a manual trigger or form submission with project details.\n2. It extracts key input data like client name, email, project type, deadline, and brand folder (optional).\n3. A Google Drive folder is automatically created inside a designated parent folder.\n4. The shareable link of the newly created folder is generated.\n5. A personalized email is composed and sent to the client using Gmail, including project details and folder link.\n\n## 🛠️ Set up steps\n1. **Google Drive Setup**:  \n   - Connect your Google Drive credentials in n8n.  \n   - Set the parent folder ID where all project folders should be created.\n\n2. **Gmail Setup**:  \n   - Connect a Gmail account with proper access.  \n   - Customize the subject and message template in the Gmail node.\n\n3. **Input Data Preparation**:  \n   - Ensure the following input fields are provided:  \n     - `client_name`  \n     - `contact_email`  \n     - `project_type`  \n     - `deadline`  \n     - `brand_drive_folder` (optional)\n\n4. **Test & Deploy**:  \n   - Use mock data or a test trigger to validate the workflow.  \n   - Once confirmed, deploy it with the actual trigger (e.g. webhook, form submission).\n",
