  "title": "Generate marketing ad banners with LINE, Gemini, and Nano Banana Pro",
  "description": "## About This Template\nThis workflow creates high-quality, text-rich advertising banners from simple LINE messages. \n\nIt combines **Google Gemini** (for marketing-focused prompt engineering) and **Nano Banana Pro** (accessed via Kie.ai API) to generate images with superior text rendering capabilities. It also handles the asynchronous API polling required for high-quality image generation.\n\n## How It Works\n1.  **Input:** Users send a banner concept via LINE (e.g., \"Coffee brand, morning vibe\").\n2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Gemini optimizes the request into a detailed prompt, specifying lighting, composition, and Japanese catch-copy placement.\n3.  **Async Generation:** The workflow submits a job to Nano Banana Pro (Kie API) and intelligently waits/polls until the image is ready.\n4.  **Hosting:** The final image is downloaded and uploaded to a public AWS S3 bucket.\n5.  **Delivery:** The image is pushed back to the user on LINE.\n\n## Who It’s For\n* Marketing teams creating A/B test assets.\n* Japanese market advertisers needing accurate text rendering.\n* Developers looking for an example of **Async API Polling** patterns in n8n.\n\n## Requirements\n* **n8n** (Cloud or Self-hosted).\n* **Kie.ai API Key** (for Nano Banana Pro model).\n* **Google Gemini API Key**.\n* **AWS S3 Bucket** (Public access enabled).\n* **LINE Official Account** (Messaging API).\n\n## Setup Steps\n1.  **Credentials:** Configure the \"Header Auth\" credential for the Kie.ai nodes (Header: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`).\n2.  **AWS:** Ensure your S3 bucket allows public read access so LINE can display the image.\n3.  **Webhook:** Add the production webhook URL to your LINE Developers console.",
