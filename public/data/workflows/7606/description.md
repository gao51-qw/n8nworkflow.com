This workflow acts as a **System Prompt Optimizer Agent**.  
You send it a draft prompt or goal, and it returns:  
1. A rewritten **optimized system prompt** that is clear, specific, and actionable.  
2. A recommendation for the **best OpenAI model** to use based on reasoning needs, complexity, and latency/cost tradeoffs.  

The workflow uses **memory** for context, so you can iteratively refine prompts.
