# Auto-publish web articles as social posts for X, LinkedIn, Reddit & Threads with Gemini AI

> *This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* 

## Description
This automation template is designed for content curators, marketers, and anyone looking to supercharge their content sharing strategy. It transforms any web article, blog post, or news link into a series of platform-specific social media posts, generated by AI. It also captures a live screenshot of the webpage to use as the post image, automating the entire process of publishing them across X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Threads, and Reddit.

***Note: The default example is configured to share n8n templates, but this workflow can promote any web page, article, or news story. Just change the URL! The upload-post node only works for self-hosted n8n instances, but you can use the standard http node for uploading the content***

## Who Is This For?
- **Content Curators & Marketers:** Effortlessly share valuable industry news and articles with tailored messages and visuals for each audience.
- **Social Media Managers:** Keep your social feeds consistently active with relevant, high-quality content without the manual overhead.
- **Community Builders & Brand Evangelists:** Quickly disseminate product updates, tutorials, and blog posts to your community on all relevant platforms.
- **Professionals & Thought Leaders:** Build your personal brand by easily sharing insightful articles with automated visuals, adding your unique perspective.

## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?
Sharing a single piece of content across multiple social platforms is tedious. You need to manually write unique posts, create visuals, and then publish everything. This workflow addresses these challenges by:
- **Automating Content Creation:** Uses a powerful AI agent (Google Gemini) to read any URL and write compelling, unique posts for each social network.
- **Generating Visuals Automatically:** Captures a high-quality screenshot of the source webpage to use as a visually appealing image in your posts, increasing engagement.
- **Ensuring Platform-Specific Tone:** The AI is instructed to generate professional posts for LinkedIn, concise threads for X, conversational updates for Threads, and community-focused posts for Reddit.
- **One-Click Distribution:** Takes a single URL as input and handles the entire content creation and sharing process across multiple platforms automatically.

## How It Works
1. **Input a URL:** In the "Set Input Data" node, simply paste the URL of the article or page you want to share.
2. **AI Analysis & Generation:** The workflow sends the URL to the AI agent, which scrapes the content and generates four distinct, ready-to-publish posts.
3. **Screenshot Generation:** At the same time, it uses the ScreenshotOne service to capture a high-quality image of the provided URL.
4. **Cross-Platform Publishing:** The generated content and the screenshot are automatically sent to the corresponding nodes to be posted on X, LinkedIn, and Threads, while the text-only version is sent to Reddit.

## Setup
1. **AI Model Credentials:** Add your Google Gemini API key to the **Google Gemini Chat Model** node to power the AI agent.
2. **Screenshot Service (ScreenshotOne):** The workflow uses ScreenshotOne to generate images for your posts.
    - Create a free account at [screenshotone.com](https://screenshotone.com) to get your own API key. **The free plan includes 100 screenshots per month.**
    - In the **Upload Post X**, **Upload Post LinkedIn**, and **Upload Post Threads** nodes, go to the `Photos` parameter (under *Additional Fields*) and replace the existing `access_key` in the URL with your own.
3. **Upload-Post Account:** This workflow uses `upload-post.com` for multi-platform posting.
    - Create a free account at [upload-post.com](https://upload-post.com) to get your API Token and User ID.
    - Add the credentials in the **Upload Post X**, **Upload Post LinkedIn**, and **Upload Post Threads** nodes.
4. **Reddit Credentials:** Connect your Reddit account using OAuth2 in the **Reddit** node to enable posting.
5. **Customize the AI:** (Optional) Edit the prompt in the **Social Media Agent** node to match your content. The default prompt is optimized for sharing n8n templates, but you can easily adapt it for any topic to fit your brand's voice and style.

## Requirements
- **Accounts:** n8n, Google (for Gemini API), ScreenshotOne, upload-post.com, Reddit.
- **API Keys & Credentials:** Google Gemini API Key, ScreenshotOne API Key, Upload-post.com API Token & User ID, Reddit OAuth2 credentials.

Use this template to become a content-sharing powerhouse, saving hours of work while increasing your reach and engagement across the web.
