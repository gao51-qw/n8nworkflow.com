It’s ideal for teams looking to generate consistent, high-quality video ads for social media without spending hours on manual design, editing, or publishing.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case\nCreating video ads usually requires multiple tools and a lot of time: writing scripts, designing product visuals, editing videos, and publishing them across platforms.  \nThis workflow **automates the entire pipeline** — from idea to ready-to-publish ad video — ensuring brands can quickly test campaigns and boost engagement without production delays.\n\n### What this workflow does\n1. **Generates ad ideas** from Telegram input (text + product image).  \n2. **Creates product visuals** using multiple AI image engines:  \n   - 🌊 **Seedream 4.0** (realistic visuals)  \n   - 🍌 **NanoBanana** (image editing & enhancement)  \n   - 🤖 **ChatGPT Image / GPT-4o** (creative variations)  \n3. **Produces cinematic video ads** with **Veo 3** based on AI-generated scripts.  \n4. **Merges multiple short clips** into a polished final ad.  \n5. **Publishes automatically** to multiple platforms (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Threads, Facebook, Pinterest, Bluesky, YouTube) via **Blotato**.  \n6. **Stores metadata and results** in Google Sheets & Google Drive for easy tracking.  \n7. **Notifies you via Telegram** with the video link and copy.\n\n### Setup\n1. **Connect your accounts** in n8n:\n   - Telegram API (for input and notifications)  \n   - Google Drive + Google Sheets (storage & tracking)  \n   - Kie AI API (Seedream + Veo 3)  \n   - Fal.ai API (NanoBanana + video merging)  \n   - OpenAI (for script and prompt generation)  \n   - Blotato API (for social publishing)  \n2. **Prepare a Google Sheet** with brand info and settings (product name, category, features, offer, website URL).  \n3. **Deploy the workflow** and connect your Telegram bot to start sending ad ideas (photo + caption).  \n4. **Run the workflow** — it will automatically generate images, create videos, and publish to your chosen channels.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Brand customization**: Adjust the Google Sheet values to reflect your brand’s offers and product features.  \n- **Platforms**: Enable/disable specific Blotato nodes depending on which platforms you want to publish to.  \n- **Video style**: Edit the AI agent’s system prompt to control tone, format, and transitions (cinematic, playful, modern, etc.).  \n- **Notifications**: Adapt Telegram nodes to send updates to different team members or channels.  \n- **Storage**: Change the Google Drive folder IDs to store generated videos and images in your preferred location.  \n\nThis workflow lets you **go from idea → images → cinematic ad video → auto-published content** in minutes, fully automated.\n\n---\n📄 **🎥 Watch This Tutorial**: [Step by Step](https://youtu.be/E-_8KZ_FSeY)\n\n---\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/Automate-video-ads-with-NanoBanana-Seedream-4-ChatGPT-Image-and-Veo-3-27e3d6550fd9800dbe46e6192bae60a9?source=copy_link)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
