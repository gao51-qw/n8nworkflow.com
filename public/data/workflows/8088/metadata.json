  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n**How it works**\n\n- This workflow automates the registration of event participants in SinergiaCRM from a Google Sheets spreadsheet.\n- A Google Sheets Trigger watches for new rows with pending registrations.\n- The flow checks if the participant already exists in SinergiaCRM by NIF (national ID).\n- If the contact exists, it creates a relationship and registers them for an event.\n- If the contact doesn’t exist, it first creates the contact, then adds the relationship and event registration.\n- Finally, it marks the row as \"Processed\" in the original spreadsheet to avoid duplicate entries.\n\n**Set up steps**\n\n- Connect your Google Sheets and SinergiaCRM accounts using OAuth credentials.\n- Replace the sample Google Sheet ID and worksheet name with your own.\n- Ensure the spreadsheet contains the following columns: First name, Last name, NIF, Email, Event ID, Relation type, Registration date, and Relation date.\n- Add the appropriate values in the \"To CRM\" and \"Processed\" columns to control processing logic.\n- Review sticky notes inside the workflow for additional guidance and customization tips.",
