# **How the Automated Workflow Works**  
## **Scheduled Fetching from Hugging Face** ⏰  
The workflow triggers every weekday at 8 AM, automatically fetching the latest papers from **Hugging Face** for easy access.  

## **Duplication Check to Avoid Redundant Entries** 🔍  
It ensures the paper's summary is not already stored in your **Notion** workspace, preventing duplicate records and keeping your database organized.  

## **Content Analysis with OpenAI** 🧠  
Using **OpenAI**'s powerful capabilities, the workflow analyzes the fetched paper summary, extracts key insights, and categorizes the content for easier understanding.  

## **Data Storage and Notification Integration** 📥🔔  
Once the summary is processed, it's automatically stored in your **Notion** workspace, and a notification containing the paper details is sent to your designated **Slack** channel for quick reference.
