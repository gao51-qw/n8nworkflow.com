If you regularly post promotional or viral-style content on platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, and more, this template will save you hours of manual work.  \n\n---\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case  \nCreating **viral short-form videos** is often time-consuming:  \n- You need to generate visuals, write scripts, edit videos, and then manually upload them to multiple platforms.  \n- Staying consistent across **TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and others** requires constant effort.  \n\nThis workflow solves the problem by **automating the entire pipeline** from idea → video creation → multi-platform publishing.  \n\n---\n\n## What this workflow does  \n1. **Collects an idea and image** from Telegram.  \n2. **Enhances visuals with NanoBanana** for user-generated content style.  \n3. **Generates a complete video script with AI** (OpenAI + structured prompts).  \n4. **Creates the final video with VEO3** using your custom prompt and visuals.  \n5. **Rewrites captions with GPT** to be short, catchy, and optimized for social platforms.  \n6. **Saves metadata in Google Sheets** for tracking and management.  \n7. **Auto-uploads the video to all major platforms via Blotato** (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, X/Twitter, Bluesky, Facebook).  \n8. **Notifies you on Telegram** with a preview link once publishing is complete.  \n\n---\n\n## Setup  \n1. **Connect your accounts**:  \n   - Google Sheets (for video tracking)  \n   - Telegram (to receive and send media)  \n   - Blotato (for multi-platform publishing)  \n   - OpenAI API (for captions, prompts, and image analysis)  \n   - VEO3 API (for video rendering)  \n   - Fal.ai (for NanoBanana image editing)  \n   - Google Drive (to store processed images)  \n\n2. **Set your credentials** in the respective nodes.  \n3. **Adjust the Google Sheet IDs** to match your own sheet structure.  \n4. **Insert your Telegram bot token** in the `Set: Bot Token (Placeholder)` node.  \n\n---\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs  \n- **Platforms**: Disable or enable only the Blotato social accounts you want to post to.  \n- **Video style**: Adjust the master prompt schema in the `Set Master Prompt` node to fine-tune tone, camera style, or video format.  \n- **Captions**: Modify the GPT prompt in the `Rewrite Caption with GPT-4o` node to control length and tone.  \n- **Notifications**: Customize the Telegram nodes to notify team members, not just yourself.  \n- **Scheduling**: Add a Cron trigger if you want automatic posting at specific times.  \n\n---\n\n✨ With this workflow, you go from **idea → AI-enhanced video → instant multi-platform publishing** in just minutes, with almost no manual work.  \n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/NonoBanan-2643d6550fd98041aef5dcbe8ab0f7a1?source=copy_link)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
