### Who is this template for?

This workflow is perfect for **bloggers, marketers, or content teams** using **Ghost CMS** who want to:

- Extract and review **all images** from articles  
- Detect missing or short **alt texts**  
- Check image **file size** and **filename SEO compliance**  
- Push the audit results into a **Google Sheet**

### How does it work?

This n8n workflow extracts all blog posts from Ghost CMS, scans the HTML to collect all embedded images, then evaluates each image for:

- ✅ Presence and length of `alt text`  
- 📏 File size in kilobytes  
- 🔤 Filename SEO quality (e.g. lowercase, hyphenated, no special chars)  

All findings are written to Google Sheets for **further analysis** or **manual cleanup**.

### 🧭 Workflow Steps:

1. 🚀 Trigger the workflow manually or on schedule  
2. 📰 Extract blog post content from Ghost CMS  
3. 🖼️ Parse all `<img>` tags with `src` and `alt` attributes  
4. 📤 Store image metadata in a Google Sheet (step 1)  
5. 🌐 Download each image using HTTP request  
6. 🧮 Extract file size, extension, and filename SEO flag  
7. 📄 Update the audit sheet with size and format insights
