✅ **Multiple Triggers:** Manual, scheduled, and on startup of the N8N instance so you can upgrade your N8N version without worrying about external libraries.

## How to install and update external libraries automatically
### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment Variables
Before using external libraries in N8N Code nodes, configure these environment variables in your Docker comppose file.
#### Option A to allow specific external npm packages in N8N Code nodes
```
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=axios,cheerio,node-fetch
```
#### Option B to allow all external npm packages in Code nodes
```
NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=*
```


### Step 2: Import the external packages workflow

Import the workflow into your N8N instance by copy pasting all nodes.

### Step 3: Input the list of external libraries you need

Edit the libraries_set node
Change the comma-separated list (e.g., axios,cheerio,node-fetch).

**If you chose Option A above**, update your NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL variable with the same packages

### Step 4: Start the workflow!
Run the workflow manually or let it trigger automatically

## Why use this to install NPM packages in N8N?
