## Auto-generate product comparison pages that help users buy faster

This workflow creates detailed "X vs Y" product comparison pages designed to help readers make faster, more confident purchase decisions — all with zero manual writing.

### How it works

- Triggered manually or via Google Sheets row
- Takes two product names as input (e.g. “Notion vs Evernote”)
- Uses AI to generate:
  - ✅ A compelling title and meta description
  - 📝 Clear feature-by-feature comparison
  - 🤝 Use-case-based recommendations
  - 💬 FAQ section tailored to user pain points
- Saves each section into a Google Sheet for review or publishing
- Final output can be exported to your CMS or website builder (like Dorik, Webflow, etc.)

---

### Set up steps

- You’ll need OpenAI and Google Sheets credentials
- Takes **10–15 minutes** to plug in your keys and connect the sheet
- Adjust prompts to match your brand tone or SEO goals

📝 You can easily expand this to generate pricing tables, testimonials, or even localized versions using the same structure.

Ideal for SaaS companies, affiliate marketers, or content teams who want to scale up comparison content — without spending hours writing.
