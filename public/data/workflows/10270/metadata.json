  "description": "# Who Is This For?\nThis n8n automation workflow is designed for sales teams, client managers, consultants, or anyone who regularly schedules and follows up on meetings — and wants to save time doing it.\nIf you often find yourself juggling between Google Sheets, Google Calendar, email, and WhatsApp just to manage your meetings, confirmations, and follow-ups — this workflow is for you.\n\n\n## What This Workflow Does\nThis workflow is structured into two main, independently scheduled branches:\n### 1. Create Event (Schedule Meetings)\n* **Trigger:** Starts automatically on a schedule (e.g., every minute).\n* **Data Source:** Fetches new meeting data from a **Google Sheet**.\n* **Event Creation:** Creates a new event in **Google Calendar** using the data.\n* **Confirmation:** Sends a confirmation message via **WhatsApp (Rapiwa)** and **Email (Gmail)**.\n* **Status Update:** Updates the source **Google Sheet** to mark the meeting as 'sent'.\n\n### 2. Reminder Event (Schedule Follow-ups)\n* **Trigger:** Starts automatically on a schedule (e.g., every minute).\n* **Past Events:** Retrieves recent past events from **Google Calendar**.\n* **Deduplication:** Uses a \"Mark as Seen\" node to prevent processing the same event multiple times.\n* **Filtering:** Filters for specific events that require a follow-up (\"Only Follow Ups\" node).\n* **AI Follow-up:** An **AI Meeting Agent (using Gemini/LLM)** uses the details of the past meeting and the Calendar's **Availability** tool to find and suggest open slots for a future meeting.\n* **Communication:** Sends a message with the suggested slots via **WhatsApp (Rapiwa)** and **Email (Gmail)**.\n\n\n## Key Features\n* **Scheduled Automation:** Both event creation and follow-up scheduling run on a recurring schedule.\n* **Data Synchronization:** Reads meeting details from and updates a **Google Sheet**.\n* **Google Calendar Integration:** Creates events and checks calendar availability.\n* **Multi-Channel Communication:** Sends confirmations/follow-ups via **WhatsApp (Rapiwa)** and **Email (Gmail)**.\n* **AI-Powered Follow-up:** Uses an **AI Agent (Gemini)** to intelligently find and format available slots for the next meeting, considering the details of the past meeting (day, time, duration).\n* **Idempotency:** The \"Mark as Seen\" node prevents duplicate follow-up attempts for the same event.\n\n\n## Requirements\n* n8n instance with nodes: Schedule Trigger, Google Sheets, Split In Batches, Date & Time, Code, Google Calendar, Rapiwa, Gmail, Filter, Agent (LangChain), LLM Chat (Google Gemini), Structured Output Parser (LangChain), Set, Remove Duplicates, Wait.\n* **Google Calendar** with an available calendar for event creation and availability checks.\n* **Google Sheets** for storing meeting details.\n* **Rapiwa** (WhatsApp API) account credentials.\n* **Gmail** account credentials.\n* **Google Gemini (PaLM) API** credentials for the AI agent.\n\n\n## How to Use — Step-by-Step Setup\n1.  **Credentials Setup**\n    * **Google Sheets OAuth2:** Configure to allow the workflow to read from and write to your Sheet.\n    * **Google Calendar OAuth2:** Configure to allow event creation and availability checks.\n    * **Rapiwa API:** Set up credentials for sending WhatsApp messages.\n    * **Gmail OAuth2:** Set up credentials for sending email confirmations/follow-ups.\n    * **Google Gemini(PaLM) API:** Set up credentials for the AI agent functionality.\n\n2.  **Configure \"Create Event\" Branch**\n    * **Get in sheet:** Update the **Document ID** and **Sheet Name** to point to your meeting data spreadsheet. The node is set to filter by a `status` column.\n    * **Create an event:** Verify the correct **Calendar ID** is selected. The `end` time is dynamically generated by the previous **Code** node.\n    * **Rapiwa / Send a message1:** Update the recipient number/email address and customize the message templates.\n    * **Update status in sheet:** Ensure the correct **Document ID**, **Sheet Name**, and matching column (`row\\_number`) are configured to update the status to \"sent\".\n\n3.  **Configure \"Reminder Event\" Branch**\n    * **Get Past Events:** Verify the correct **Calendar ID** is selected.\n    * **Only Follow Ups:** Customize the filter condition if only a subset of past meetings needs follow-up (e.g., if you have a \"Follow-up Status\" column to check).\n    * **Meeting Agent:** Review the **System Message** to ensure the AI's logic for finding slots matches your business rules (e.g., preferred working hours, look-ahead period).\n    * **Generate Message:** Customize the **message** template, which formats the AI-suggested slots.\n    * **Rapiwa1 / Send a message:** Update the recipient number/email address for the follow-up messages.\n\n\n\n## Google Sheet Required Columns\nThe workflow expects a Google Sheet with meeting data to have at least the following columns:\n**A Google Sheet formatted like this** ➤ [Sample Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSRrIDvw-Q9NugRK3eT7GMa0kwe0QnGhdySnqq1_kJU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n| title                                   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | location          | color_number | start time         | end time           | reminder status | status  |\n| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :-------------- | :------ |\n| 2025 Personal Planner & Events Calendar | Stay organized and never miss an important date!
