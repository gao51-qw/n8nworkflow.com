  "description": "# Create curated industry trend reports from Medium to Google Docs\n\nThis workflow automates the process of market research by generating high-quality, curated digests of Medium articles for specific topics. It scrapes recent content, uses AI to filter out spam and duplicates, categorizes the stories into readable buckets, and compiles everything into a formatted Google Doc report.\n\n## Target Audience\nContent marketers, market researchers, product managers, and investors looking to track industry trends without reading through noise.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Schedule**: The workflow runs on a defined schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) via the **Schedule Trigger**.\n2. **Define Source**: A **Set** node defines the specific Medium tag URL to track (e.g., `/tag/artificial-intelligence`).\n3. **Scrape Content**: **BrowserAct** visits the target Medium page and scrapes the latest article titles, authors, and summaries.\n4. **Analyze & Filter**: An **AI Agent** (powered by Claude via OpenRouter) analyzes the raw feed. It removes duplicates, filters out spam/clickbait, and categorizes high-quality stories into buckets (e.g., \"Must Reads,\" \"Engineering,\" \"Wealth\").\n5. **Create Report**: A **Google Docs** node creates a new document using the digest title generated by the AI.\n6. **Build Document**: The workflow loops through the analyzed items, appending headers and body text to the Google Doc section by section.\n7. **Notify Team**: A **Slack** node sends a message to your chosen channel confirming the report is ready.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **BrowserAct**, **Google Docs**, **Slack**, and **OpenRouter** accounts in n8n.\n2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Automated Industry Trend Scraper & Outline Creator** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.\n3. **Set Target Topic**: Open the **Target Page** node and replace the `Target_Medium_Link` with the Medium tag archive you wish to track (e.g., `https://medium.com/tag/bitcoin/archive`).\n4. **Configure Notification**: Open the **Send a message** node (Slack) and select the channel where you want to receive alerts.\n5. **Activate**: Turn the workflow on.\n\n## Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** account with the **Automated Industry Trend Scraper & Outline Creator** template.\n* **Google Docs** account.\n* **Slack** account.\n* **OpenRouter** account (or any compatible LLM credentials).\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n1. **Adjust the AI Persona**: Modify the system prompt in the **Analyzer & Script writer** node to change the categorization buckets (e.g., change \"Engineering\" to \"Marketing Strategies\").\n2. **Change the Output Destination**: Replace the Google Docs nodes with **Notion** or **Airtable** nodes if you prefer a database format over a document.\n3. **Add Email Delivery**: Add a **Gmail** or **Outlook** node at the end to email the finished Google Doc link directly to stakeholders.\n\n## Need Help?\n* [How to Find Your BrowserAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDjoZWEsZlE)\n* [How to Connect n8n to BrowserAct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n\n---\n### Workflow Guidance and Showcase Video\n\n* #### [Stop Writing Outlines!
