  "description": "## Who it’s for? \nAnyone who wants a dead-simple, free-tier friendly way to run custom API logic on **Google Cloud Run** and call it securely from n8n—no public exposure, no local hosting.\n\n## What it does \nMinimal flow: **Set** → **JWT (sign)** → **HTTP (token exchange)** → **HTTP (call Cloud Run with `Authorization: Bearer &lt;id_token&gt;` )**. No caching, no extras—just enough to authenticate and hit your endpoint.\n\n## How to set up \nGeneral instructions below—see my detailed guide for more info: \n\n**[Build a Secure Google Cloud Run API, Then Call It from n8n (Free Tier)](https://medium.com/@marcocodes/build-a-secure-google-cloud-run-api-then-call-it-from-n8n-88c03291a95f)**\n\nSetup:\n1. Create a Cloud Run service and enable **Require authentication (Cloud IAM)**.  \n2. Create a Google **Service Account** with **Cloud Run Invoker** on that service.  \n3. In n8n, set `service_url`, `client_email`, `token_uri` (`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`) in **Set**.  \n4. Create a **JWT (PEM)** credential from your service account key (paste the full BEGIN/END block).  \n5. Run the workflow; the second HTTP node calls your Cloud Run URL with the ID token.\n\n## Requirements\n- Cloud Run service URL (auth required)  \n- Google Service Account with **Cloud Run Invoker**  \n- Private key JSON fields downloaded from Service Account | needed to generate JWT credentials\n\n## More details\nFull write-up (minimal + modular versions):  \n\n**[Build a Secure Google Cloud Run API, Then Call It from n8n (Free Tier)](https://medium.com/@marcocodes/build-a-secure-google-cloud-run-api-then-call-it-from-n8n-88c03291a95f)** \n",
