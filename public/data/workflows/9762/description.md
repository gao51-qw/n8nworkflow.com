Overview This template creates a smart FAQ bot on Telegram, powered by Google Gemini for intelligent answers and Supabase to store user data. The workflow can distinguish between new and existing users.

How It Works

Trigger: The workflow starts when a user sends any message to the Telegram Bot.

Check User: It looks up the user's chat_id in a Supabase telegram_users table.

Route (New vs. Existing):

New User (True Path): If the user is not found, the workflow saves their chat_id to Supabase and sends a one-time welcome message.

Existing User (False Path): If the user exists, the workflow proceeds to the AI step.

Generate Answer: It loads a predefined FAQ context and combines it with the user's question. This is sent to Google Gemini via the AI Agent node.

Send Response: The AI-generated answer is sent back to the user on Telegram.
