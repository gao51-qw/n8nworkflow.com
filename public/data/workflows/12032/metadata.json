  "description": "Turn discovery call forms into polished, personalized proposals in seconds. This workflow captures prospect information via Typeform, uses GPT-4 to write compelling proposal content, and automatically creates professional PandaDoc documents with pricing tables.\n\n**Who is this for?**\n\nFreelancers, consultants, agencies, and service businesses who want to:\n- Stop spending hours writing proposals manually\n- Respond to prospects faster with professional documents\n- Maintain consistent proposal quality at scale\n\n**What problem does it solve?**\n\nWriting proposals is time-consuming and inconsistent. This workflow automates the entire process—from form submission to ready-to-send document—while keeping your proposals personalized and professional.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. Prospect fills out your Typeform discovery questionnaire\n2. Workflow validates required fields (email, company name)\n3. AI automatically selects the right template based on budget and project complexity\n4. GPT-4 writes personalized proposal content tailored to the prospect's challenges\n5. GPT-4 generates realistic project milestones\n6. PandaDoc creates a professional document with pricing table\n7. You receive a Slack notification with a direct link to review\n\n**Template selection logic**\n\nThe workflow intelligently routes to the appropriate template:\n\n- **Quick Quote** → Budget under $2,500 AND simple project\n- **Standard Proposal** → Budget $2,500+ OR complex project\n\n**What you get**\n\n- Personalized proposal content written by GPT-4\n- Challenge summary that shows you understand their pain points\n- Specific benefits with metrics (time savings, cost savings)\n- 4-phase project timeline with realistic milestones\n- Professional PandaDoc document with pricing table\n- Slack notifications for successes and errors\n\n**Setup time:** 15-20 minutes\n\n**Setup steps**\n\n1. Add your OpenAI API credential (select in the 3 GPT nodes)\n2. Add your Typeform API credential\n3. Add your PandaDoc API credential (HTTP Header Auth with your API key)\n4. Create a Typeform with discovery questions (see below)\n5. Create 2 PandaDoc templates (Quick Quote + Standard Proposal)\n6. Update the Config node with your company info and template IDs\n7. Add your Slack webhook URL to the Config node\n\n**Typeform questions needed**\n\nYour discovery form should include these fields:\n- What's your company name?\n- What industry are you in?\n- What's your biggest operational challenge?\n- What would the ideal solution look like?\n- What tools/platforms do you currently use?\n- How complex is this project? (Simple / Moderate / Complex)\n- What's your estimated budget? (Under $1,500 / $1,500-$2,500 / $2,500-$5,000 / $5,000-$10,000 / $10,000+)\n- First name\n- Last name\n- Email address\n\n**PandaDoc template tokens**\n\nYour PandaDoc templates should include these placeholder tokens:\n- Client.Company, Client.FirstName, Client.LastName\n- Client.ChallengeSummary\n- Project.Total, Project.Deposit\n- Project.TimeSavings, Project.CostSavings\n- Timeline.Phase1-4, Timeline.Phase1Date-4Date\n- Impact.Bullet1-3\n- Proposal.ExpiryDate, Document.Date\n\n**Requirements**\n\n- OpenAI API account (~$0.05-0.15 per proposal)\n- Typeform account (free tier works)\n- PandaDoc account (API access required)\n- Slack workspace (for notifications)\n\n**Good to know**\n\n- Processing time: 15-30 seconds per proposal\n- All errors are caught and sent to Slack so you can follow up manually\n- The Config node centralizes all settings—easy to customize\n- GPT prompts are editable to match your writing style\n- Budget threshold is adjustable (default: $2,500)\n- Quick Quote proposals expire in 7 days, Standard in 14 days",
