The n8n Nostr Community Node is a tool that integrates Nostr functionality into n8n workflows, allowing users to interact with the Nostr protocol seamlessly. It provides both read and write capabilities and can be used for various automation tasks.

**Disclaimer**
This node is ideal for self-hosted n8n setups, as ++community nodes are not supported on n8n cloud++. It opens up exciting possibilities for integrating workflows with the decentralized Nostr protocol.
