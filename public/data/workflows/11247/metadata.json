  "description": "## This n8n template implements a Calendly Booking & Cancellation Automation Hub that automatically processes Calendly webhook events, logs data to Google Sheets, and sends intelligent Slack notifications\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis template is designed for **professionals, teams, and businesses** who use Calendly for scheduling and want to automate their booking management workflow. It's perfect for:\n\n- **Sales teams** who need instant notifications about new bookings and cancellations\n- **Service providers** (consultants, coaches, therapists) who want to track appointments automatically\n- **Businesses** that need centralized logging of all booking events for analytics\n- **Teams** that want smart categorization of urgent bookings and last-minute cancellations\n- **Organizations** requiring automated follow-up workflows based on booking status\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow creates a **comprehensive Calendly automation system** that automatically processes booking confirmations and cancellations. The system:\n\n1. **Listens for Calendly events** via webhook trigger for:\n   - `invitee.created` - New booking confirmations\n   - `invitee.canceled` - Booking cancellations\n\n2. **Routes events intelligently** using a Switch node to separate booking and cancellation processing\n\n3. **For Bookings:**\n   - Extracts and transforms all booking data (invitee info, event details, timing, location, guests)\n   - Calculates computed fields (formatted dates/times, duration, days until event, urgency flags)\n   - **Detects urgent bookings** (same-day or next-day appointments) for priority handling\n   - Logs complete booking information to Google Sheets\n   - Sends formatted Slack notifications with meeting links, reschedule/cancel options\n\n4. **For Cancellations:**\n   - Extracts cancellation details (reason, who canceled, timing)\n   - **Categorizes cancellations** into three types:\n     - **Last Minute** (within 24 hours of event) - High priority follow-up\n     - **Standard** (upcoming events) - Normal priority\n     - **Past Event** (already occurred) - Low priority\n   - Calculates hours before event for timing analysis\n   - Logs cancellation data to Google Sheets\n   - Sends categorized Slack alerts with follow-up priority indicators\n\n5. **Data Management:**\n   - Stores all bookings in a dedicated Google Sheets tab\n   - Stores all cancellations in a separate Google Sheets tab\n   - Maintains complete event history for analytics and reporting\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1. Configure Calendly Webhook Trigger\n- Go to [developer.calendly.com](https://developer.calendly.com)\n- Create an OAuth2 application or use Personal Access Token\n- In n8n, add Calendly OAuth2 credentials\n- The workflow automatically registers webhooks for `invitee.created` and `invitee.canceled` events\n- Ensure your Calendly account has the necessary permissions\n\n### 2. Set up Google Sheets\n- Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with two tabs:\n  - **Bookings** - For logging new booking confirmations\n  - **Cancellations** - For logging cancelled appointments\n- Configure Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n- Update the document ID in both Google Sheets nodes:\n  - \"Log to Bookings Sheet1\" node\n  - \"Log to Cancellations Sheet\" node\n- The workflow uses auto-mapping, so ensure your sheet headers match the data fields\n\n### 3. Configure Slack Notifications\n- Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com)\n- Add Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `channels:read`\n- Install the app to your workspace\n- Add Slack OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n- Update the channel name in both Slack nodes (default: \"general\")\n- Customize notification messages if needed\n\n### 4. Test the Workflow\n- Activate the workflow in n8n\n- Create a test booking in Calendly\n- Verify that:\n  - Data appears in Google Sheets\n  - Slack notification is received\n  - All fields are correctly populated\n- Test cancellation flow by canceling a booking\n\n### 5. Customize (Optional)\n- Adjust urgency detection logic (currently same-day or next-day)\n- Modify Slack notification formatting\n- Add email notifications using Email nodes\n- Integrate with CRM systems (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)\n- Add follow-up email automation\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Calendly account** with active scheduling links\n- **Google Sheets account** with a spreadsheet set up\n- **Slack workspace** with app installation permissions\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n- **OAuth2 credentials** for Calendly, Google Sheets, and Slack\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify Urgency Detection\n- Edit the \"Check Urgency\" IF node to change what constitutes an urgent booking\n- Currently flags same-day or next-day bookings\n- Adjust the `days_until_event` threshold as needed\n\n### Enhance Slack Notifications\n- Customize message formatting in Slack nodes\n- Add emoji or formatting to match your team's style\n- Include additional fields from the booking data\n- Add @mentions for urgent bookings\n\n### Add Email Notifications\n- Insert Email nodes after Slack notifications\n- Send confirmation emails to invitees\n- Notify team members via email\n- Create email templates for different event types\n\n### Integrate with CRM\n- Add HTTP Request nodes to sync bookings to your CRM\n- Update contact records when bookings are created\n- Create opportunities or deals from booking data\n- Sync cancellation reasons for analysis\n\n### Add Analytics\n- Create additional Google Sheets tabs for analytics\n- Use formulas to calculate booking rates, cancellation rates\n- Track popular time slots and event types\n- Monitor team member availability\n\n### Customize Data Fields\n- Modify the \"Transform Booking Data\" and \"Transform Cancellation Data\" Set nodes\n- Add custom fields based on your Calendly form questions\n- Extract additional metadata from the webhook payload\n- Calculate business-specific metrics\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Automatic event processing** - No manual intervention required\n- **Smart urgency detection** - Identifies same-day and next-day bookings automatically\n- **Intelligent cancellation categorization** - Classifies cancellations by timing and priority\n- **Comprehensive data extraction** - Captures all booking details including guests, questions, and metadata\n- **Dual logging system** - Separate sheets for bookings and cancellations\n- **Rich Slack notifications** - Formatted messages with meeting links and action buttons\n- **Computed fields** - Automatically calculates duration, days until event, formatted dates/times\n- **Error handling** - Nodes configured with `continueRegularOutput` to prevent workflow failures\n- **Scalable architecture** - Handles high-volume booking scenarios\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Sales team automation** - Instant notifications when prospects book demos\n- **Consultant scheduling** - Track all client appointments in one place\n- **Service business management** - Monitor bookings and cancellations for service providers\n- **Team calendar coordination** - Keep team members informed about schedule changes\n- **Analytics and reporting** - Build dashboards from logged booking data\n- **Customer relationship management** - Sync booking data with CRM systems\n- **Follow-up automation** - Trigger email sequences based on booking status\n- **Resource planning** - Analyze booking patterns to optimize scheduling\n\n## Data Fields Captured\n\n### Booking Data\n- Event ID, invitee name, email, first name\n- Event name, start/end times (ISO format)\n- Formatted date and time (human-readable)\n- Timezone, duration in minutes\n- Meeting URL (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.)\n- Reschedule and cancel URLs\n- Location type (virtual, in-person, etc.)\n- Guest count and guest emails\n- Questions and answers (JSON format)\n- Days until event, same-day flag\n- Urgency status and label\n- Processing timestamp\n\n### Cancellation Data\n- Event ID, invitee name, email\n- Original scheduled date and time\n- Cancellation reason\n- Who canceled (invitee/host)\n- Canceler type\n- Hours before event\n- Last-minute flag (&lt; 24 hours)\n- Cancellation category and priority\n- Cancellation timestamp\n\n## Workflow Architecture\n\nThe workflow uses a **routing pattern** to handle different event types:\n\n1. **Calendly Webhook Trigger** → Receives all events\n2. **Route Event Type (Switch)** → Separates bookings from cancellations\n3. **Parallel Processing** → Each path processes independently\n4. **Data Transformation** → Set nodes extract and format data\n5. **Intelligent Routing** → IF/Switch nodes categorize by urgency/type\n6. **Data Logging** → Google Sheets stores all events\n7. **Notifications** → Slack alerts team members\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: New Booking\n1. Customer books a 30-minute consultation for tomorrow\n2. Workflow detects it's a next-day booking (urgent)\n3. Data logged to \"Bookings\" sheet with urgency flag\n4. Slack notification sent with 🚨 URGENT label\n5. Team member receives instant alert\n\n### Scenario 2: Last-Minute Cancellation\n1. Customer cancels meeting 2 hours before scheduled time\n2. Workflow categorizes as \"last-minute\" cancellation\n3. Data logged to \"Cancellations\" sheet with high priority\n4. Slack alert sent with 🚨 LAST MINUTE label\n5. Team can immediately follow up or fill the slot\n\n### Scenario 3: Standard Cancellation\n1. Customer cancels meeting 3 days in advance\n2. Workflow categorizes as \"standard\" cancellation\n3. Data logged with normal priority\n4. Slack notification sent with standard formatting\n5. Team can plan accordingly\n\nThis template transforms your Calendly scheduling into a fully automated booking management system, ensuring no booking goes unnoticed and providing valuable insights into your scheduling patterns and customer behavior.\n",
