  "description": "\n![Workflow Screenshot](https://www.dr-firas.com/Automate-WhatsApp.png)\n\n# AI-powered WhatsApp booking system with instant SMS confirmations\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for solo entrepreneurs, consultants, coaches, clinics, or any business that handles client appointments and wants to automate the entire scheduling experience via WhatsApp — without the need for live agents.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nResponding to inbound messages, collecting booking details, suggesting available times, and sending reminders can be a huge time drain. This workflow eliminates manual handling by:\n- Automating WhatsApp conversations with an AI assistant\n- Booking appointments directly into Cal.com\n- Sending timely SMS reminders before appointments\n\nIt ensures you never miss a lead or a follow-up — even while you sleep.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nFrom a single WhatsApp message, the workflow:\n\n1. Triggers via a WhatsApp webhook\n2. Uses GPT-4 to handle conversation flow and qualify the prospect\n3. Collects name, email, selected service\n4. Calls Cal.com API to fetch available time slots\n5. Books the appointment and stores it in Google Sheets\n6. Sends a confirmation message via WhatsApp\n7. Periodically scans for upcoming appointments\n8. Sends SMS reminders to clients 2 hours before their session\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Connect your **Webhook** node to a WhatsApp API (e.g., 360dialog, Twilio, or Ultramsg)\n2. Add your **OpenAI API key** for the GPT-4 nodes\n3. Configure your **Cal.com API key** and set your calendar ID\n4. Link your **Google Sheets** with fields like: `name`, `email`, `date`, `time`, `status`, `reminder_sent`\n5. Connect your **SMS service** (e.g., sms77) with API credentials\n6. Adjust the schedule in the reminder node as needed\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Change the language or tone of the AI assistant** by editing the system prompt in the GPT node\n- **Filter available time slots** by service, team member, or duration\n- **Modify the reminder timing** (e.g., 1 hour before, 24h before, etc.)\n- **Add conditional logic** to route users to different booking flows based on their responses\n- **Integrate additional CRMs** or notification channels like email or Slack\n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/WhatsApp-II-20f3d6550fd980b9b2e6fe5e1a84051b?source=copy_link)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
