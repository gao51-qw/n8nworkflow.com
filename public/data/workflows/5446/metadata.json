  "description": "This n8n workflow acts as an AI-powered Inbox Assistant that automatically summarizes and classifies Gmail emails, prioritizes important messages, and sends a daily digest to Slack. It’s ideal for startup founders and small teams juggling investor intros, customer leads, and support queries — all from a busy Gmail inbox.\n\nEach email is processed using ChatGPT to generate a concise summary, classify the message (e.g., Support, Investor, Spam), and determine its urgency.
