## How it works:
- Detects new unread Gmail messages
- Extracts sender name for personalized replies
- Classifies the email into one of four categories
- Applies the correct Gmail label and either sends an auto-reply, creates a draft, or logs the contact in Google Sheets

## Setup steps:
- Takes about 5–10 minutes to connect accounts and set labels
- Connect Gmail, OpenAI, and optional Google Sheets in n8n
- Add label IDs, Google Sheet ID, sheet name, and phone number in Set – Config
- Create four Gmail labels for the categories
- Keep full setup instructions in the sticky notes inside the workflow
