This **n8n workflow template** checks for new **major releases** (tagged with `.0`) of the **n8n project** using its official **GitHub releases feed**. It runs multiple times a day and sends notifications via **email and Telegram** if a new release is found.

&gt; ⚠️ *Note: You must **activate the workflow** to start receiving release notifications.*

### 🧠 **How It Works: Workflow Overview**

1. **Cron Trigger**  
   Runs the workflow at 10:00, 14:00, and 18:00 daily.

2. **Read RSS Feed**  
   Pulls data from `https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases.atom`.

3. **Filter by Current Day**  
   Filters the feed to match:
   - Releases **published in the last 4 hours**
   - Titles starting with `n8n@` and **ending with `.0`**

4. **Condition Check**  
   Uses a regex to check if the filter result contains any release data.

5. **Notifications**  
   - If a new major release is found, sends:
     - **Telegram message** to a specified chat
     - **Email** via AWS SES with release info

### 📨 **Final Output**

You'll receive a **Telegram message** and **email** when a new major n8n version is released.
