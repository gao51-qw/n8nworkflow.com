## How it works

This workflow demonstrates how to use n8n to serve a complete, styled HTML webpage. It acts as a mini web server, responding to browser requests with your custom HTML content.

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow starts with a `Webhook` node configured to listen for `GET` requests on a specific path. When you visit this node's Production URL in a browser, it triggers the workflow.
2.  **Respond with HTML:** The `Respond to Webhook` node is configured to send a response back to the browser.
    *   **Content-Type Header:** It sets a crucial response header, `Content-Type: text/html`, which tells the browser to render the response as a webpage, not just plain text.
    *   **HTML Body:** The entire HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the webpage is pasted directly into the `Body` field of this node.

When activated, visiting the webhook URL will instantly display the custom webpage.
