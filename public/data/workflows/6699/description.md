## 🧠 RAG AI Medical Agent – n8n Workflow

## 👥 Who’s it for
This workflow is perfect for:
- **Healthcare ecommerce businesses** that want to automate product recommendations.
- **Founders or developers** building an AI assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with product data.
- **Anyone** wanting to combine OpenAI, Qdrant vector search, and Google Sheets to power intelligent medical queries.

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

This RAG-based workflow allows users to **ask medical questions** related to hair or scalp issues (e.g., hair loss, thinning). It:

1. Retrieves product info from a **Google Sheet**.
2. Converts product data into **text embeddings** using OpenAI.
3. Stores those embeddings in a **Qdrant vector database**.
4. On chat message trigger, performs a **vector similarity search** to match user symptoms with relevant products.
5. Uses an **AI agent** to respond with top 3 matching products from your catalog.

## 🛠️ How to set up

## Step 1: 🗂 Get your data
- Make sure your **Google Sheet** contains the following columns:
  - `Product Name`
  - `Symptoms Involved`
  - `Product Description`
  - `ForeverBetty Product Page Link`
  - `Category` (optional but recommended)

## Step 2: 🔐 Connect your accounts
- Add your **Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials** in the "Get all products" node.
- Add your **OpenAI API key** in the embedding nodes.
- Add your **Qdrant credentials** in the vector store nodes.

## Step 3: 🧠 Populate the Vector DB
1. Click **“Execute workflow”** manually.
2. This pulls data from the Google Sheet.
3. Each row is:
   - Formatted properly into a vector-friendly string.
   - Converted into an embedding using OpenAI.
   - Stored into Qdrant.

## Step 4: 💬 Enable Chat Interface
- Use the **ChatTrigger** to receive user queries.
- The agent searches Qdrant for relevant vectors.
- Replies with product suggestions via LangChain's LLM agent.

## 🧩 How to customize it

## 🔄 Change the data structure
- Update the "Set Data Properly in vector database" node to modify what fields are embedded.
- Example:
  ```handlebars
  --- 
  Product: {{ $json['Product Name '] }}
  Use-case: {{ $json['Symptoms Involved'] }}
  Link: {{ $json['ForeverBetty Product Page Link '] }}
