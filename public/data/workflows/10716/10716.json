    "description": "## Who Is This For?\nThis **n8n automation workflow** is designed for **customer support teams**, **business owners**, or **service providers** who want to **automate customer interactions on WhatsApp**.\n\nIf you regularly receive customer queries about your products, services, or technical issues — and need a system that can instantly respond, fetch data from Google Sheets or Docs, log support tickets, and send human-like replies — this workflow is for you.\nIt’s perfect for teams using **Rapiwa**, **Google Sheets**, and **Google Docs** who want to provide a smart, AI-driven, yet personal support experience.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\nThis workflow is structured around a single intelligent AI assistant called **Rapiwa** that interacts with customers in real time through WhatsApp.\n\n\n## Key Features\n**AI-Driven Support Assistant (Rapiwa)**  \n**WhatsApp Integration via Rapiwa API**  \n**Dynamic Data Access (Google Sheets + Docs)**  \n**Knowledge Base Search**  \n**Conversation Memory**  \n**Automatic Logging**  \n**Multi-Product Support**\n\n\n### Workflow Overview\n1. **Rapiwa Trigger (Start Node)**\n   - Starts the workflow automatically whenever a new WhatsApp message is received in your Rapiwa account.\n   - Example: When a customer sends a message like “What’s the price of SocialVibe?” or “I can’t access my dashboard”, this node triggers the workflow.\n2. **If (Check Text)**\n   - Detects if the incoming message contains text (not just images, videos, or audio).\n   - If it’s text, the workflow continues; otherwise, it stops or handles it differently.\n\n3. **AI Agent – Customer Support Agent**\n   - This is the brain of the system — your **AI Assistant (Rapiwa)**.\n   - Interprets the user’s question, retrieves information, and replies in a clear, WhatsApp-friendly format.\n   - Reads product details and company info from Google Sheets/Docs.\n   - Fetches documentation links from the connected “Support Desk” and product-specific HTTP tools.\n   - Logs customer issues to the support sheet for tracking and analysis.\n\n4. **Memory (Session Context)**\n   - Stores chat history per user session so Rapiwa remembers context during a conversation.\n\n5. **Research (AI Support Tool)**\n   - Acts as Rapiwa’s research assistant — gathers and organizes information from multiple sources.\n   - Sources: Google Sheets, Google Docs, HTTP Tools, and Support Desk.\n\n6. **Replay (Rapiwa Send Message)**\n   - Sends the AI’s final message back to the customer on WhatsApp using the Rapiwa API.\n   - WhatsApp-optimized plain text messages only.\n\n\n## Data & Integrations\n### 🔹 Google Sheets (Database)\n- **Product Data Sheet:** Holds product names, descriptions, and pricing.\n- **Service Data Sheet:** Lists offered services with details.\n- **Support Log Sheet:** Records each issue (Issue, Category, Solution).\n\n### 🔹 Google Docs\n- Provides company information when a user asks about your organization.\n\n## Example Use Case\n**User Message:**  \n&gt; “Hi, I’m having a problem with my Faculty login.”\n\n**Rapiwa’s AI Response:**  \n&gt; “I’m sorry you’re having trouble logging in to Faculty. Please try resetting your password here: https://faculty.spagreen.net/docs/#reset-password  \n&gt; If the issue continues, I can log this for support. Would you like me to do that?”\n\n## Useful Links\n- **install process:** [how to install rapiwa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-rapiwa)\n- **Dashboard:** [https://app.rapiwa.com](https://app.rapiwa.com/login)\n- **Official Website:** [https://rapiwa.com](https://rapiwa.com/)\n- **Documentation:** [https://docs.rapiwa.com](https://docs.rapiwa.com/)\n\n## Support & Help\n- **WhatsApp**: [Chat on WhatsApp](https://wa.me/8801322827799)\n- **Discord**: [SpaGreen Community](https://discord.gg/SsCChWEP)\n- **Facebook Group**: [SpaGreen Support](https://www.facebook.com/groups/spagreenbd)\n- **Website**: [https://spagreen.net](https://spagreen.net)\n- **Developer Portfolio**: [Codecanyon SpaGreen](https://codecanyon.net/user/spagreen/portfolio)",
