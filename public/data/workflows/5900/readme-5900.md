## 📄 Google Sheet Column Structure

Your source Google Sheet should include the following columns:

| Column Name       | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Prompt`          | The text prompt to generate an image from        |
| `drive path`      | (Optional) File path or URL of saved image       |
| `Generated Date`  | Date/time the image was generated                |
