  "description": "## 🧠 How it works  \nThis workflow automatically **transcribes and translates voice messages from Telegram to Slack**, enabling seamless communication between **Japanese** and **English** speakers.  \n\nIn our real-world use case, our distributed team often sends short voice updates on Telegram — but most discussion happens on Slack.  \nBefore this workflow, we constantly asked:  \n- “Can someone write a summary of that voice message?”  \n- “I can’t understand what was said — is there a transcript?”  \n- “Can we translate this audio for our English-speaking teammates?”  \n\nThis workflow fixes that problem **without changing anyone’s communication habits**.  \nBuilt with **n8n**, **OpenAI Whisper**, and **GPT-4o-mini**, it automatically:  \n- Detects when a voice message is posted on Telegram  \n- Downloads and transcribes it via Whisper  \n- Translates the text with GPT-4o-mini  \n- Posts the result in Slack — with flags 🇯🇵→🇺🇸 and username attribution  \n\n\n## ⚙️ Features  \n- 🎧 **Voice-to-text transcription** using **OpenAI Whisper**  \n- 🌐 **Automatic JA ↔ EN detection and translation** via **GPT-4o-mini**  \n- 💬 Clean Slack message formatting with flags, username, and original text   \n- 🔧 Easy to customize: adjust target languages, tone, or message style  \n- ⚡ Typical end-to-end time: under 10 seconds for short audio clips  \n\n\n## 💼 Use Cases  \n- **Global teams** – Send quick voice memos in Telegram and share readable translations in Slack  \n- **Project coordination** – Record updates while commuting and post bilingual notes automatically  \n- **Remote check-ins** – Replace daily written reports with spoken updates  \n- **Cross-language collaboration** – Let English and Japanese teammates stay perfectly synced  \n\n\n## 💡 Perfect for  \n- **Bilingual creators and managers** working across Japan and Southeast Asia  \n- **AI automation enthusiasts** who love connecting voice and chat platforms  \n- **Teams using Telegram for fast communication** and Slack for structured workspaces  \n\n\n## 🧩 Notes  \n- Requires three credentials:  \n  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`  \n  - `OPENAI_API_KEY_HEADER`  \n  - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_HEADER`  \n- Slack scopes: `chat:write`, `files:write`, `channels:history`  \n- You can **change translation direction or add languages** in the “Detect Language” → “Translate (OpenAI)” nodes.  \n- Keep audio files under **25 MB** for Whisper processing.  \n- Always export your workflow with **credentials OFF** before sharing or publishing.  \n\n\n### ✨ Powered by  \n**OpenAI Whisper** × **GPT-4o-mini** × **n8n** × **Telegram Bot API** × **Slack API**  \nA complete multilingual voice-to-text bridge — connecting speech, translation, and collaboration across platforms. 🌍\n",
