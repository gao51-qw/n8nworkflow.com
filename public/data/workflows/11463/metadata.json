  "description": "## Dental Clinic Automation: Scheduling, Availability & Patient Lookup\nThis workflow automates dental appointment management through a phone-based assistant. It listens for requests like booking, rescheduling, canceling, checking insurance, looking up appointments, and finding available time slots. Each request is processed through a Switch node and then routed to your Supabase database for action.\n\n## How it works\nOnce a request is received, the workflow uses the patient’s phone number to identify them. Then, it:\n- Booking: Checks for available time, creates or retrieves the patient record, and stores the appointment.\n- Rescheduling: Confirms the new date, avoids double-booking, and updates the record.\n- Canceling: Removes the appointment and sends a confirmation.\n- Insurance: Looks up the member ID and provides a status (accepted or not).\n- Availability: Finds the doctor’s existing appointments and generates available 60-minute slots.\n- Appointment & doctor lists: Retrieves and presents clean, structured information for the assistant.\nEach action ends with a webhook response that the phone system reads back to the patient.\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Add your Supabase credentials to the Supabase nodes.\n2. Connect your phone/voice system to the webhook URL.\n3. Ensure Supabase table and column names match the workflow.\n4. Test all actions (booking, rescheduling, canceling, etc.) before going live.\n\n## Customization tips (optional)\nYou can update working hours, appointment durations, or add new services by modifying the availability logic or Switch node routing.",
