## How it works

This workflow captures new subscribers from a Mailchimp list and extracts their key details.  
It then enriches the subscriber data using AI, predicting professional attributes and assigning a lead score.  
Based on the score, high-value leads are identified, and all leads are synced into HubSpot and Pipedrive.  
For top-priority leads, the workflow automatically creates new deals in Pipedrive for sales follow-up.
