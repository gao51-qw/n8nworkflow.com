    "description": "## Description\n\nThis workflow acts as an autonomous Tier 2 Customer Support Agent. It doesn't just answer questions; it manages the entire lifecycle of a support ticket—from triage to resolution with Guardrails to deal with prompt injections, PII information blocking, etc. enabling such threats are blocked and logged in Airtable.\n\nUnlike standard auto-responders, this system uses a \"Master Orchestrator\" architecture to coordinate specialized sub-agents. It creates a safe, human-like support experience by combining RAG (Knowledge Base retrieval) with a safety-first state machine.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe workflow operates on a strict \"Hub and Spoke\" model managed by a Master Orchestrator:\n\n1. Security Guardrails (The Gatekeeper) Before the AI even sees the message, a hard-coded security layer scans for Prompt Injection attacks, Profanity, and PII. If a threat is detected, the workflow locks down, logs the incident to Airtable, and stops execution immediately.\n\n2. Orchestration & Triage Once the message passes safety checks, the Master Orchestrator takes over. Its first action is to call the Ticket Analyser Agent.\n\n3. Analysis & Scoring The Ticket Analyser classifies the issue (e.g., \"Technical,\" \"Billing\") and scores the customer's sentiment. It returns a priority_score to the Master Orchestrator.\n\n4. The Decision Logic (Circuit Breaker) The Master Orchestrator evaluates the score:\n\nEscalation: If the customer is \"Furious\" or the score is high, it bypasses AI drafting and immediately alerts a human manager via Slack.\n\nResolution Path: If the request is standard, it proceeds to the next steps.\n\n5. Knowledge Retrieval (RAG) The Orchestrator calls the Knowledge Worker Agent. This agent searches your Supabase vector store to find specific, verified company policies or troubleshooting steps relevant to the user's issue.\n\n6. Resolution Drafting Armed with the analysis and the retrieved facts, the Orchestrator calls the Resolution Agent. This agent synthesizes a polite, professional email draft.\n\n7. Final Execution The Master Orchestrator reviews the final draft and sends the email via Gmail.\n\n## Set up\n\nThis is multi-agent system. Please follow these steps to configure the environment:\n\n⚠️ IMPORTANT: This template contains the Main Orchestrator AND the Sub-Agents in a single view. You must separate them for the system to function:\n\nSeparate the Agents: Copy the nodes for each sub-agent (Ticket Analyser, Knowledge Worker, Resolution Agent) into their own new workflows.\n\nLink the Tools: In the Main Orchestrator workflow, open the \"Call [Agent Name]\" tool nodes and update the Workflow ID to point to the new workflows you just created.\n\nConfigure Credentials: You will need credentials for Gmail (or your preferred email provider), Slack, Airtable, Supabase (for the vector store), and Google Gemini (or OpenAI).\n\nInitialize the Knowledge Base:\n\nOpen the \"One time Document Loader\" section in the workflow.\n\nUpload your policy document (PDF/Text) to the \"Upload your file here\" node.\n\nRun this branch once to vectorize your documents into Supabase.\n\nSetup Airtable: Create a simple table with columns for Sender Email, Incident Type, and Flagged Content to log security threats caught by the guardrails.\n\nCustomize the Trigger: Update the Gmail Trigger node to watch for your specific support alias (e.g., support@yourdomain.com) and ensure it only picks up \"Unread\" emails.\n\nAdjust the Escalation Sensitivity: In the Orchestrator Agent node, you can tweak the \"Phase 2\" logic to change what triggers a human hand-off (currently set to priority_score &gt;= 0.9).\n\nGood to go!\n\n![image.png](fileId:3643)",

Your mission is to autonomously manage the entire customer ticket lifecycle, ensuring safety, compliance, and accurate resolution. You will control and maintain state throughout the process, using the defined tools exclusively.\n\nYou MUST follow the defined five-phase sequence below:\n\n### PHASE 1: TRIAGE (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)\nYour very first action MUST be to call the Ticket Triage Analyser Agent (TTA) to classify the initial user message.\nAnalyze the resulting JSON output from the TTA (specifically the sentiment and priority_score). Do below steps diligently.\n\n1. Call the `Ticket Triage Analyser Agent`.\n2. **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** YOU MUST STOP AND WAIT for the Triage Agent's result before deciding the next step. DO NOT plan beyond this step until you see the JSON output.\n\n### PHASE 2: EVALUATION & ROUTING (STRICT)\n**Upon receiving the Triage Agent's JSON output:**\n* **IF** `priority_score` >= 0.9 OR `sentiment` is \"Furious\":\n    * **STEP A:** Call `Slack Tool`.\n    * **STEP B:** Call `Email Reply Tool` (using the apology template).\n    * **STEP C:** **TERMINATE WORKFLOW.** \n**THEN**, Do NOT call the Knowledge Agent. Do NOT call the Knowledge worker & Investigation Agent . Do NOT call the Resolution Agent. Mission Complete.\n\n* **ELSE** (For all other scores and topics, queries):\n    * Proceed to Phase 3 (Knowledge Retrieval).\n\nEmergency Protocol: When triggered, you are forbidden from seeking a technical resolution. Your sequence of actions MUST be as below:\n\nCall the Slack Tool to alert the human manager.\nInput: Generate an urgent alert message parameter called alertMessage that includes the Sentiment, Priority Score, and a short Summary of the customer's issue.\nCall the Email Reply Tool with a final, pre-approved apology template, using the \"Reply\" operation to the customer.\nSTOP EXECUTION and return the final response.\n\nFOR ALL OTHER CUSTOMER GENERAL QUERIES and IF sentiment is \"Neutral\" and IF the situation is normal, proceed immediately to Phase 3.\n\nPHASE 3: KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL (RAG)\nRule: For all non-escalated issues (technical, policy, or refund questions), you MUST call the Knowledge worker & Investigation Agent.\n\nInput: Your query to the Knowledge worker & Investigation Agent must be the Triage Agent's Summary combined with the Original Customer Query.\n\nSynthesize the retrieved RAG context and the TTA's analysis to form a complete resolution brief.\n\nSummary of Actions(Phase 3):\n1. **Rule:** For non-escalated issues, call the `Knowledge worker & Investigation Agent`.\n2. **Input:** Your query must combine the Triage Summary and the Original Customer Query.\n3. **Goal:** Retrieve facts and policy details.\n\nPHASE 4: SYNTHESIS AND REVIEW (Drafting)\nDrafting: Call the Resolution Agent. Pass the synthesized RAG context and the original message to generate the response draft.\n\nThe Review Loop: After receiving the drafted email from the Resolution Agent, you MUST review it against the facts gathered in Phase 3.\n\nCheck: Verify that the drafted response aligns 100% with the facts retrieved from the RAG context.\n\nIF DRAFT IS WRONG: Send feedback (e.g., \"The refund percentage is wrong. Use 10%\") to the Resolution Agent with specific instructions for correction. Repeat this step until the draft is correct.\n\nIF DRAFT IS CORRECT: Proceed to Phase 5.\n\nSummary of Actions(Phase 4):\n1. **Action:** Call the `Resolution Agent`.\n2. **Input:** Pass the `retrievedFacts` (from Phase 3) and the original customer message.\n3. **Goal:** Generate a polite, plain-text email draft.\n\nPHASE 5: FINAL ACTION (SEND EMAIL TO SENDER TO ADDRESS QUERIES; CONCERNS and URGENT SENSITIVE ISSUES)\nAction: Call the Email Reply Tool. \nInput: Pass the draft text received from the Resolution Agent into the 'Message' parameter. (Do not use a subject line).\n\nSummary of Actions(Phase 5 Final Action):\n1. **Action:** Call the `Email Reply Tool` to send the email.\n2. **Input:** Use the draft text received from the Resolution Agent as the message body.\n3. **Conclusion:** Mark the ticket as resolved or work in progress accordingly and end the process.\n\n⚙️ Available Tools:\n\nTicket Triage Analyser Agent: Classifies the customer message and determines priority.\n\nKnowledge worker & Investigation Agent: Retrieves facts and policy details from the internal knowledge base (RAG).\n\nResolution Agent: Generates the final email response draft.\n\nSlack Tool: Notifies the senior manager or head of department about urgent issues and escalations.\n\nEmail Reply Tool: Sends the final communication for general email responses and for emergency response to tackle an irate customer (e.g., apology, reply, acknowledgment, solutions).\n"

It receives emails, ensures safety, and coordinates specialized sub-agents to resolve tickets or escalate them.\n\nThe Orchestrator (Manager): This is the main agent. It holds the \"State\" (context) of the conversation. It creates a plan, decides which tool to use next, and evaluates if the job is done. It controls the logic flow.\nThe Workers (Sub-Agents): These are specialized tools. They don't know about the whole conversation; they just do one job perfectly when asked.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Ingest & Guard:** Emails are triggered via Gmail. A Guardrail AI checks for PII and \"jailbreak\" attempts. Threats are logged to Airtable; safe emails proceed.\n2. **Orchestrate:** The Master Agent calls a \"Email/Ticket Analyser Triage\" agent to analyze sentiment.\nIf **Critical/Furious:** Immediate Slack alert to human manager + Apology email.\nElse, **For all other standard queries, requests and clarifications**:\n   - Calls the \"Knowledge Worker\" (RAG) to find facts\n   - Then, the \"Resolution Agent\" to draft a reply.\n3. **Resolve:** The Master Agent reviews the draft sent by Resolution agent and sends the reply via Gmail.\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. **Separate Agents:** This file contains 3 sub-workflows (Analyzer, Knowledge, Resolution) at the bottom. Move each group into its own separate workflow file.\n2. **Connect Tools:** Update the `Call [Agent] Workflow` nodes in the Orchestrator to point to your new sub-workflow IDs.\n3. REPLACE the \"Placeholder Edit Fields (Set) Node\" with \"When executed by another workflow trigger\". Set node is placed to facilitate users to easily get started with required schema input fields and adapt the template. Also, because in one canvas, there cannot be multiple \"When executed by another workflow\" triggers.\n3. **Credentials:** Configure Gmail, Slack, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Airtable and Supabase credentials.\n4. **Knowledge Base:** Use the \"Document Loader\" section once to upload your policy file or copy sample text in Text Area of the Knowledge Loader.\n\n## Test steps\nSend email (as customer) -> Email node triggers -> Agents and Tools are triggered as applicable based on the customer query / issue from email -> Customer receives an email response\n\nTry out!"

Keyword Triggers: The message contains references to \"Legal action,\" \"Lawsuit,\" \"CEO,\" \"Cancel subscription immediately,\" or \"Data loss.\" 1.2 Emergency Containment Procedure When a ticket is flagged as Critical/Escalated, the following protocol is mandatory for all Agents (Human and AI): Immediate Cease of Technical Resolution: Do not attempt to troubleshoot, ask for logs, or request screenshots. The priority shifts solely to de-escalation. Notification: A mandatory alert must be sent to the #critical-alerts Slack channel. The alert must contain the Customer Sentiment Score and a brief summary of the grievance. Communication Standard: The response must strictly adhere to the APOLOGY-101 template. Directive: Acknowledge the frustration, accept responsibility (if applicable), and promise Manager review within 1 hour. Template ID: APOLOGY-101  2.0 TECHNICAL SUPPORT OPERATIONS 2.1 Error 503 (Service Unavailable) Diagnosis: Error 503 is officially classified as a client-side network caching issue, not a server-side application outage. Standard Troubleshooting Procedure (SOP): Agents must advise the customer to perform the following steps in order: Cache Clearance: Clear browser cache and cookies. Session Reset: Log out of the application and wait exactly 5 minutes to allow the session token to expire. Browser Isolation: Attempt to log in using an Incognito (Chrome) or Private (Firefox/Safari) window. Network Reset: If the issue persists, verify VPN settings or restart the local network router. 2.2 App Access & Login Issues If a user cannot access the app but is not receiving Error 503: Version Control: Verify the user is on the latest app version. Connectivity: Confirm stable internet connection. Credential Reset: Direct users to the self-service \"Forgot Password\" flow. Agents are prohibited from manually resetting passwords for security reasons. 2.3 License Management Policy Automatic Lifecycle: Customer licenses are programmed to automatically reset every 90 days. Manual Reset Criteria: A manual reset is permitted ONLY if: The customer reports a \"License Expired\" error. AND the error occurred within the last 30 days of the cycle. AND the action is approved by a Tier 2 Agent or Orchestrator. Execution: Manual resets are performed via the License Manager tool and have a processing time of approximately 5 minutes.  3.0 BILLING & REFUND POLICY 3.1 Authorized Refund Tools Refunds must strictly be processed through the 'Billing Portal' tool. No other system is authorized for financial transactions. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is required to access this tool. 3.2 Partial Refund (SLA Compensation) Authorization: Resolution Agents (Tier 1 & AI) are authorized to issue partial refunds without Manager approval under specific conditions.   Criteria: Customer has been verified as unable to access the software for > 48 hours. The outage is due to a confirmed system-side failure (excludes user-side Error 503). Compensation Limit: Amount: Flat 10% of the current billing cycle value. Script Requirement: Agents must state: \"I have issued a 10% refund for this month's billing cycle as compensation for the downtime.\" 3.3 Full Refunds Policy: Full refunds are restricted to the 14-day \"Cooling Off\" period for new subscriptions. Escalation: AI Agents are not authorized to issue full refunds. These requests must be routed to the Human Billing Specialist queue."
