This n8n workflow demonstrates how to transform natural language date and time expressions into structured data with 96%+ accuracy. Parse complex expressions like "early next July", "2 weeks after project launch", or "end of Q3" into precise datetime objects with confidence scoring, timezone intelligence, and business rules validation for any automation workflow.

## **Good to know**
* Achieves 96%+ accuracy on complex natural language date expressions
* At time of writing, this is the most advanced open-source date parser available
* Includes AI learning that improves over time with user corrections
* Supports 6 languages with auto-detection (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese)
* Sub-millisecond response times with intelligent caching
* Enterprise-grade with business intelligence and timezone handling

## How it works
* **Natural Language Input**: Receives date expressions via webhook, form, email, or chat
* **AI-Powered Parsing**: Your world-class date parser processes the text through:
 - 50+ custom rule patterns for complex expressions
 - Multi-language auto-detection and smart translation
 - Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for AI decision-making
 - Ambiguity detection with helpful suggestions
* **Business Intelligence**: Applies enterprise rules automatically:
 - Holiday calendar awareness (US + International)
 - Working hours validation and warnings
 - Business day auto-adjustment
 - Timezone normalization (IANA format)
* **Smart Scheduling**: Creates calendar events with:
 - Structured datetime objects (start/end times)
 - Confidence metadata for workflow decisions
 - Alternative interpretations for ambiguous inputs
 - Rich context for follow-up actions
* **Integration Ready**: Outputs connect seamlessly to:
 - Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar
 - CRM systems (HubSpot, Salesforce)
 - Project management tools (Notion, Asana)
 - Communication platforms (Slack, Teams)

## How to use
* The webhook trigger receives natural language date requests from any source
* Replace the MCP server URL with your deployed date parser endpoint
* Configure timezone preferences for your organization
* Customize business rules (working hours, holidays) in the parser settings
* Connect calendar integration nodes for automatic event creation
* Add notification workflows for scheduling confirmations

## Use Cases
* **Meeting Scheduling**: "Schedule our quarterly review for early Q3"
* **Project Management**: "Set deadline 2 weeks after product launch"
* **Event Planning**: "Book venue for the weekend before Labor Day"
* **Personal Assistant**: "Remind me about dentist appointment next Tuesday morning"
* **International Teams**: "Team standup tomorrow morning" (auto-timezone conversion)
* **Seasonal Planning**: "Launch campaign in late spring 2025"

## Requirements
* Natural Language Date Parser MCP server (provided code)
* Webhook endpoint or form trigger
* Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
* Optional: Slack/Teams for notifications
* Optional: Database for learning pattern storage

## Customizing this workflow
* **Multi-language Support**: Enable auto-detection for global teams
* **Business Rules**: Configure company holidays and working hours
* **Learning System**: Enable AI learning from user corrections
* **Integration Depth**: Connect to your existing calendar and CRM systems
* **Confidence Thresholds**: Set minimum confidence levels for auto-scheduling
* **Ambiguity Handling**: Route unclear dates to human review or clarification requests
