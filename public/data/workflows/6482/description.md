## Who’s it for 🎯  
This workflow is designed for animal advocacy organizations, activists, and campaigners who want to automatically receive a **weekly email update** summarizing the latest news and developments related to animal rights, welfare, vegetarianism, and veganism. **It can also be easily altered to allow daily updates.**

## How it works / What it does ⚙️  
Runs on a weekly schedule and uses a multi-tool research agent subworkflow to gather verified news strictly from the past week. It compiles the information and URLs into a clean, well-structured HTML email, then sends it to the specified recipient. URLs are never altered or omitted.

## How to set up 🛠️  
1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.  
2. Add and install the required research subworkflow:  
   [Multi-tool Research Agent for Animal Advocacy](https://n8n.io/workflows/5588-multi-tool-research-agent-for-animal-advocacy-with-openrouter-serper-and-open-paws-db/)  
3. Configure API keys in n8n credentials.  
4. Set your topics, instructions, and recipient email in the “Set Preferences” node.  
5. Adjust the schedule node to control when emails are sent.  
6. Test the full workflow to ensure proper operation.
