  "description": "## Disclaimer\n\nPlease note - This workflow is only available on n8n self-hosted as it’s making use of the community node for the Decodo Web Scraping\n\n![Analyze & Summarize Amazon Product Reviews with Decodo, OpenAI and Google Sheets](fileId:3311)\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of scraping, analyzing, and summarizing Amazon product reviews using **Decodo’s Amazon Scraper**, **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini**, and **Google Sheets** for seamless reporting.\n\nIt turns messy, unstructured customer feedback into actionable product insights — all without manual review reading.\n\n\n## Who this is for\n\nThis workflow is designed for:\n\n* **E-commerce product managers** who need consolidated insights from hundreds of reviews.\n* **Brand analysts and marketing teams** performing sentiment or trend tracking.\n* **AI and data engineers** building automated review intelligence pipelines.\n* **Sellers and D2C founders** who want to monitor customer satisfaction and pain points.\n* **Product researchers** performing market comparison or competitive analysis.\n\n\n## What problem this workflow solves\n\nReading and analyzing hundreds or thousands of Amazon reviews manually is inefficient and subjective.\n\nThis workflow automates the entire process — from **data collection** to **AI summarization** — enabling teams to instantly identify customer pain points, trends, and strengths.\n\nSpecifically, it:\n\n* Eliminates manual review extraction from product pages.\n* Generates **comprehensive and abstract summaries** using GPT-4.1-mini.\n* Centralizes structured insights into **Google Sheets** for visualization or sharing.\n* Helps track product sentiment and emerging issues over time.\n\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the automation process:\n\n1. **Set Input Fields**\n   Define your Amazon product URL, geo region, and desired file name.\n\n2. **Decodo Amazon Scraper**\n   Fetches real-time product reviews from the Amazon product page, including star ratings and AI-generated summaries.\n\n3. **Extract Reviews Node**\n   Extracts raw customer reviews and Decodo’s AI summary into a structured JSON format.\n\n4. **Perform Review Analysis (GPT-4.1-mini)**\n   Uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to create two key summaries:\n\n   * **Comprehensive Review:** A detailed summary that captures sentiment, recurring themes, and product pros/cons.\n   * **Abstract Review:** A concise executive summary that captures the overall essence of user feedback.\n\n5. **Persist Structured JSON**\n   Saves the raw and AI-enriched data to a local file for reference.\n\n6. **Append to Google Sheets**\n   Uploads both the original reviews and AI summaries into a Google Sheet for ongoing analysis, reporting, or dashboard integration.\n\n**Outcome:**\nYou get a structured, AI-enriched dataset of Amazon product reviews — summarized, searchable, and easy to visualize.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n### Pre-requisite\n\nIf you are new to Decode, please signup on this link [visit.decodo.com](https://visit.decodo.com/dOxzkK)\n\nPlease make sure to install the n8n custom node for Decodo.\n\n![Install Decodo Community Node](fileId:3255)\n\n![Decodo Community Node](fileId:3256)\n\n### Step 1 — Import the Workflow\n\n1. Open n8n and import the JSON workflow template.\n2. Ensure the following credentials are configured:\n\n   * **Decodo Credentials account** → Decodo API Key\n   * **OpenAI account** → OpenAI API Key\n   * **Google Sheets account** → Connected via OAuth\n\n### Step 2 — Input Product Details\n\nIn the **Set node**, replace:\n\n* `amazon_url` → your product link (e.g., `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVM1PSYN`)\n* `geo` → your region (e.g., `US`, `India`)\n* `file_name` → output file name (optional)\n\n### Step 3 — Connect Google Sheets\n\nLink your desired Google Sheet for data storage. Ensure the sheet columns match:\n\n* `product_reviews`\n* `all_reviews`\n\n### Step 4 — Run the Workflow\n\nClick **Execute Workflow**.\nWithin seconds, your Amazon product reviews will be fetched, summarized by AI, and logged into Google Sheets.\n\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n\nYou can tailor this workflow for different use cases:\n\n* **Add Sentiment Analysis** — Add another GPT node to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.\n* **Multi-Language Reviews** — Include a language detection node before summarization.\n* **Send Alerts** — Add a Slack or Gmail node to notify when negative sentiment exceeds a threshold.\n* **Store in Database** — Replace Google Sheets with MySQL, Postgres, or Notion nodes.\n* **Visualization Layer** — Connect your Google Sheet to Looker Studio or Power BI for dynamic dashboards.\n* **Alternative AI Models** — Swap GPT-4.1-mini with Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3, or Mistral for experimentation.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis workflow transforms the tedious process of reading hundreds of Amazon reviews into a **streamlined AI-powered insight engine**.\n\nBy combining **Decodo’s scraping precision**, **OpenAI’s summarization power**, and **Google Sheets’ accessibility**, it enables continuous review monitoring.\n\nIn one click, it delivers **comprehensive and abstract AI summaries**, ready for your next product decision meeting or market strategy session.\n\n",
