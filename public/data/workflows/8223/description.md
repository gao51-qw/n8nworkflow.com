X (Twitter) and Threads (by Meta) both have different maximum character lengths.

## Different X and Threads Content Auto Poster  
### This n8n template demonstrates how to post different content optimized for X (Twitter) and Meta Threads using the Late API.  

You can use it for any niche. For example: posting AI news to X and Threads.  

**Possible use cases:**

### How it works  
- The automation runs according to the time defined in the Schedule Trigger node.  
- Content is pulled from Google Sheets.  
- Any URL is shortened using your preferred short URL API.  
- Images are uploaded to Late’s server first.  
- Content for X is posted in Step 2. The workflow checks that the content length is under 280 characters.  
- Content for Threads is posted in Step 3. The workflow checks that the content length is under 500 characters.  
- Posts on X are published as threaded posts, while on Threads they are single posts.  
- Once posted, the Google Sheets content database is updated.
