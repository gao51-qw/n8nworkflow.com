# Automate your Magento 2 weekly sales & performance reports

> ### Automatically fetches last week’s Magento 2 orders, summarises sales and product performance, logs the data to Google Sheets, and emails a polished report — all without logging into admin or buying extra modules. 

**Perfect for store owners and agencies.**

#### ✅ What This Workflow Does:
This workflow automatically fetches the last 7 days of orders from your Magento 2 store, summarizes key metrics (orders, revenue, products sold), groups product performance data, generates a Google Sheet with two tabs (Weekly Summary & Product Breakdown), and emails the report to your team in a modern dashboard-style HTML format — all without ever logging into Magento admin.

####  🔧 Modules Used:
🕒 Schedule Trigger
⚙️ Code (JavaScript)
🌐 HTTP Request
📊 Google Sheets
✉️ Gmail (HTML Email with custom design)

#### 💼 Use Cases:
- E-commerce store managers who want weekly sales snapshots without logging into Magento 2.
- Agencies managing multiple Magento clients and reporting to them weekly.
- Business owners who want automated insights without paying for extra reporting modules.
- Marketing or growth teams that need product-wise performance regularly in Google Sheets.

#### 🔒 Credentials Required:
- Magento 2 API (Bearer Token)
- Google Sheets OAuth2
- Gmail OAuth2 (for sending HTML email reports)

#### ✨ Why This Saves Hours:
This workflow replaces manual Magento report exports, repetitive data cleanup, and weekly email formatting. Store managers often waste 1–2 hours/week collecting data — now it takes 0 minutes. Just set it and forget it.
You don’t need to buy reporting extensions, log into the admin, or manually touch a spreadsheet again.
