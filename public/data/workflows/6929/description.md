- Digital asset custodians

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual blockchain monitoring is time-consuming and prone to missing critical events, often leading to delayed responses to high-value transactions, security threats, or unusual network activity. This template solves the challenge of real-time blockchain surveillance by automatically detecting, analyzing, and alerting on significant blockchain events using AI-powered intelligence and instant notifications.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically monitors blockchain activity in real-time, uses ScrapeGraphAI to intelligently extract transaction data from explorer pages, performs sophisticated risk analysis, and instantly alerts your team about significant events across multiple blockchains.

### Key Components

1. **Blockchain Webhook** - Real-time trigger that activates when new blocks are detected
2. **Data Normalizer** - Standardizes blockchain data across different networks
3. **ScrapeGraphAI Extractor** - AI-powered transaction data extraction from blockchain explorers
4. **Risk Analyzer** - Advanced risk scoring based on transaction patterns and values
5. **Smart Filter** - Intelligently routes only significant events for alerts
6. **Slack Alert System** - Instant formatted notifications to your team

## 📊 Risk Analysis Specifications

The template performs comprehensive risk analysis with the following parameters:

| Risk Factor | Threshold | Score Impact | Description |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **High-Value Transactions** | &gt;$10,000 USD | +15 per transaction | Individual transactions exceeding threshold |
| **Block Volume** | &gt;$1M USD | +20 points | Total block transaction volume |
| **Block Volume** | &gt;$100K USD | +10 points | Moderate block transaction volume |
| **Failure Rate** | &gt;10% | +15 points | Percentage of failed transactions in block |
| **Multiple High-Value** | &gt;3 transactions | Alert trigger | Multiple large transactions in single block |
| **Critical Failure Rate** | &gt;20% | Alert trigger | Extremely high failure rate indicator |

**Risk Levels:**
- **High Risk**: Score ≥ 50 (Immediate alerts)
- **Medium Risk**: Score ≥ 25 (Standard alerts)
- **Low Risk**: Score &lt; 25 (No alerts)
