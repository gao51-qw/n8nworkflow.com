# What this workflow does?

This is a n8n **Taxi Booking Worker**, the worker node to process the job. It will wait for message from the Call Center node and handle the real process here. In this particular case, it will check the input number for the selected provider, then update the booking from NEW to OPEN, then clean up the orphan data.

# **How it works**

- The **Form Trigger** node will wait for the message from any node with the input in number.
- First check for NEW booking under the same chat session
- For input 0, which is cancel
    - Reset the user session in Redis memory
- For input 1 or above, which is the provider selection number
    - Set the booking status to OPEN in database
    - OPTIONAL Save the summary to **User Memory** database
    - OPTIONAL Create a new Event in **Google Calendar** and sync to the database
    - Reset the user session in Redis memory
- Afterward, process data clean up
    - Delete the provider selection number queue in Redis
    - Delete the route data in Redis
    - OPTIONAL Delete the chat memory with current session
- Finally, output the response to the **Call Back** node
