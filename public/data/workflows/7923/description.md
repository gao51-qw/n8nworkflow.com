📝 Description

This workflow automates the collection, filtering, and scoring of trending AskReddit posts for viral potential. It pulls posts from Reddit, removes duplicates, calculates a custom virality score, and writes the final candidates into Google Sheets for later use in content creation.

This is Phase 1 of the AskReddit → YouTube Shorts automation pipeline. It prepares clean, high-quality data that can be used in the next phases (script generation, AI video creation, and publishing).
