## How it works

This workflow creates a complete MCPserver that provides comprehensive API integration monitoring and testing capabilities. The server exposes five specialized tools through a single MCP endpoint: API health analysis, webhook reliability testing, rate limit monitoring, authentication verification, and client report generation. External applications can connect to this MCP server to access all monitoring tools.

## Who is this for

This template is designed for DevOps engineers, API developers, integration specialists, and technical teams responsible for maintaining API reliability and performance. It's particularly valuable for organizations managing multiple API integrations, SaaS providers monitoring client integrations, and development teams implementing API monitoring strategies. 

## Requirements

- **MCP Client**: Any MCP-compatible application (Claude Desktop, custom MCP client, or other AI tools)
- **Network Access**: Outbound HTTP/HTTPS access to test API endpoints and webhooks
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for securing the MCP server endpoint
- **Target APIs**: The APIs and webhooks you want to monitor (no special configuration required on target systems)

## How to set up

1. **Configure MCP Server Authentication** - Update the **MCP Server - API Monitor Entry** node with your desired authentication method and generate a secure bearer token for accessing your MCP server

2. **Deploy the Workflow** - Save and activate the workflow in your n8n instance, noting the MCP server endpoint URL that will be generated for external client connections

3. **Connect MCP Client** - Configure your MCP client (such as Claude Desktop) to connect to the MCP server endpoint using the authentication token you configured

4. **Test Monitoring Tools** - Use your MCP client to call the available tools: Analyze Api Health, Validate Webhook Reliability, Monitor API Limits, Verify Authentication, and Generate Client Report with your API endpoints and credentials
