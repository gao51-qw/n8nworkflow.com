## Overview

- This workflow is an **AI-powered Dental Appointment Assistant** that automates appointment booking, rescheduling, and cancellations through **Telegram** or a **Webhook**.  
- It uses intelligent agents to understand user intent, gather details, manage Google Calendar events, update records in Google Sheets, and send confirmation emails — creating a **fully automated and customizable booking system** suitable for **any business**, not just dental clinics.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction  
- The workflow can be triggered via **Telegram**, **Webhook**, and can easily be extended to **WhatsApp** or **Facebook Messenger**.  
- The **Planning Agent** starts the conversation and collects essential details like:  
  - Appointment type (book, update, or delete)  
  - Date and time preference  
  - Service type or reason for visit  
  - Personal details (name, email, etc.)  
- Based on the user’s intent, it routes the conversation to the appropriate booking flow.

### 2. Booking Flow  
- The **Booking Agent** handles the actual scheduling logic.  
- It interacts with **Google Calendar** to:  
  - **Create new events** for fresh appointments  
  - **Update existing events** for reschedules  
  - **Delete events** for cancellations  
- It ensures proper validation (availability, overlaps, etc.) before confirming any calendar changes.

### 3. Post-Booking Actions  
- Once the booking action is completed:  
  - The **Mail and Sheet Entry Agent** updates the **Google Sheet** with user details such as:  
    - Name  
    - Email  
    - Appointment date & time  
    - Status (booked/updated/cancelled)  
    - Short description of the appointment  
  - Sends an **email confirmation** to the user (for all actions — create, update, or delete).  
  - Sends a **final message** via Telegram (or chosen platform) confirming the status of the appointment.

## How to Use  
- Trigger the workflow via **Telegram** or a **Webhook URL**.  
- The AI assistant will guide the user step-by-step through booking, updating, or cancelling an appointment.  
- Once confirmed, the system:  
  - Updates Google Calendar automatically  
  - Logs the appointment details in Google Sheets  
  - Sends an email and chat confirmation message to the user
