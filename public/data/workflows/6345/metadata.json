  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\nThis comprehensive RAG workflow enables your AI agents to answer user questions with contextual knowledge pulled from your own documents — using metadata-rich embeddings stored in Supabase.\n\n🔧 Key Features:\nRAG Agents powered by GPT-4.5 or GPT-3.5 via OpenRouter or OpenAI.\n\nSupabase Vector Store to store and retrieve document embeddings.\n\nCohere Reranker to improve response relevance and quality.\n\nMetadata Agent to enrich vectorized data before ingestion.\n\nPDF Extraction Flow to automatically parse and upload documents with metadata.\n\n✅ Setup Steps:\nConnect your Supabase Vector Store.\n\nUse OpenAI Embeddings (e.g. text-embedding-3-small).\n\nAdd API keys for OpenAI and/or OpenRouter.\n\nConnect a reranker like Cohere.\n\nProcess documents with metadata before embedding.\n\nStart chatting — your AI agent now returns context-rich answers from your own knowledge base!\n\nPerfect for building AI assistants that can reason, search and answer based on internal company data, academic papers, support docs, or personal notes.",
