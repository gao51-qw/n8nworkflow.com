  "description": "## 📧 Email Validation Workflow Using APILayer API\n\nThis **n8n workflow** enables users to validate email addresses in real time using the [APILayer Email Verification API](https://apilayer.com/). It's particularly useful for preventing invalid email submissions during lead generation, user registration, or newsletter sign-ups, ultimately improving data quality and reducing bounce rates.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Trigger the Workflow Manually:**\n   - The workflow starts with the `Manual Trigger` node, allowing you to test it on demand from the n8n editor.\n\n2. **Set Required Fields:**\n   - The `Set Email & Access Key` node allows you to enter:\n     - `email`: The target email address to validate.\n     - `access_key`: Your personal API key from [apilayer.net](https://apilayer.com/).\n\n3. **Make the API Call:**\n   - The `HTTP Request` node dynamically constructs the URL:\n     ```bash\n     https://apilayer.net/api/check?access_key={{ $json.access_key }}&email={{ $json.email }}\n     ```\n   - It sends a GET request to the APILayer endpoint and returns a detailed response about the email's validity.\n\n4. *(Optional)*: You can add additional nodes to filter, store, or react to the results depending on your needs.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 How to Customize\n\n- Replace the **manual trigger** with a webhook or schedule trigger to automate validations.\n- Dynamically map the `email` and `access_key` values from previous nodes or external data sources.\n- Add conditional logic to **filter out invalid emails**, log them into a database, or send alerts via Slack or Email.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Use Case & Benefits\n\nEmail validation is crucial in maintaining a clean and functional mailing list. This workflow is especially valuable in:\n- Sign-up forms where real-time email checks prevent fake or disposable emails.\n- CRM systems to ensure user-entered emails are valid before saving them.\n- Marketing pipelines to **minimize email bounce rates** and increase campaign deliverability.\n\nUsing APILayer’s trusted validation service, you can verify whether an email exists, check if it’s a role-based address (like `info@` or `support@`), and identify disposable email services—all with a simple workflow.\n\n---\n\n**Keywords**: email validation, n8n workflow, APILayer API, verify email, real-time email check, clean email list, reduce bounce rate, data accuracy, API integration, no-code automation\n",
