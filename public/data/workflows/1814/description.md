This is a workflow that might come handy after using loops. They usually leave you with items spread across different "runs". The Code node in this example workflow merges them into a single run, so you have a single list of items which is often easier to work with.

Simply adjust the node name inside the Code node as needed.

The idea is based on [this](https://n8n.io/workflows/1160-merge-data-for-multiple-executions/) older workflow template.
