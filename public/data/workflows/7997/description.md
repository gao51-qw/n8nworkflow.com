**How it works**

Runs on a schedule and iterates a watchlist of symbols (e.g., BTC/ETH/SOL).

For each symbol, request intraday 1h OHLCV from EODHD.

A Code node computes Wilder’s RSI(14) and detects 30/70 crossings.

When a signal appears, the bot sends a Telegram alert (HTML message) with price, RSI (prev → now), timestamp, and a “View chart” button that opens the pair on TradingView (BINANCE/USD).

**Set up steps (≈10–15 min)**

Prereqs: n8n (cloud or self-hosted), EODHD API key, Telegram bot + your chat_id.

Env vars: set EODHD_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID on your n8n instance.

Credentials: add your Telegram credential (bot token).

Import the workflow JSON.

Edit Fields node: adjust the symbol array to your watchlist.

Schedule Trigger: choose how often to run (e.g., every 5–10 min).

Test: temporarily flip the Code node’s FORCE_ALERT flag to true to verify Telegram delivery, then set it back to false.
