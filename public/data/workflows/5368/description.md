How it works
• Allows users to manage their Google Calendar via WhatsApp using natural language
• Handles event creation, updates, deletions, availability checks, and agenda overviews
• AI agent interprets the user’s message and triggers the appropriate calendar action
• Responses are sent back to the user via WhatsApp, with confirmation or schedule info

Set up steps
• Set up a WhatsApp Business Cloud account and configure your webhook
• Connect your Google Calendar using n8n credentials
• Deploy OpenAI API key for natural language understanding
• Link each calendar action (create, update, delete, search) to the TimePilot agent
• Customize confirmation messages and automate reply formatting

Note: More detailed configuration and custom logic are described inside sticky notes within the workflow.
