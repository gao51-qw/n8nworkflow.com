This n8n workflow demonstrates a simple approach to improve chat UX by staggering an AI Agent's reply for users who send in a sequence of partial messages and in short bursts.

## How it works
* Twilio webhook receives user's messages which are recorded in a message stack powered by Redis.
* The execution is immediately paused for 5 seconds and then another check is done against the message stack for the latest message.
* The purpose of this check lets use know if the user is sending more messages or if they are waiting for a reply.
* The execution is aborted if the latest message on the stack differs from the incoming message and continues if they are the same.
* For the latter, the agent receives the buffered messages up to that point and is able to respond to them in a single reply.

## Requirements
* A Twilio account and SMS-enabled phone number to receive messages.
* Redis instance for the messages stack.
* OpenAI account for the language model.

## Customising the workflow

This workflow should work for other common messaging platforms such as Whatsapp and Telegram.
