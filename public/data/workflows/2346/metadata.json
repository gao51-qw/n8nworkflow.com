  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates a simple approach to improve chat UX by staggering an AI Agent's reply for users who send in a sequence of partial messages and in short bursts.\n\n## How it works\n* Twilio webhook receives user's messages which are recorded in a message stack powered by Redis.\n* The execution is immediately paused for 5 seconds and then another check is done against the message stack for the latest message.\n* The purpose of this check lets use know if the user is sending more messages or if they are waiting for a reply.\n* The execution is aborted if the latest message on the stack differs from the incoming message and continues if they are the same.\n* For the latter, the agent receives the buffered messages up to that point and is able to respond to them in a single reply.\n\n## Requirements\n* A Twilio account and SMS-enabled phone number to receive messages.\n* Redis instance for the messages stack.\n* OpenAI account for the language model.\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nThis workflow should work for other common messaging platforms such as Whatsapp and Telegram.\n\n5 seconds too long or too short? Adjust the wait threshold to suit your customers.",
