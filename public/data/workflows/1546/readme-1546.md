# Create a QuickBooks invoice on a new Onfleet task creation

> **Summary**

Onfleet is a last-mile delivery software that provides end-to-end route planning, dispatch, communication, and analytics to handle the heavy lifting while you can focus on your customers.

This workflow template listens to an Onfleet event and interacts with the **QuickBooks API**. You can easily streamline this with your QuickBooks invoices or other entities. Typically, you can create an invoice when an Onfleet task is created to allow your customers to pay ahead of an upcoming delivery.
