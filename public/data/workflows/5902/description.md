### Translating your YouTube video titles and descriptions into multiple languages is one of the simplest ways to expand your channel's global reach. But doing it manually is super tedious and time-consuming. This n8n workflow automates the entire process: from detecting your latest video, translating its metadata into multiple languages using AI, to publishing the translated versions directly to YouTube - all managed and tracked through a connected Google Sheet only.

## What Problem Is This Workflow Solving?
Manually translating YouTube metadata—titles, descriptions, and tags—is both time-consuming and costly, especially as your video library grows. For example, let's say you want to translate the metadata of 50 videos into 5 languages, and if you spend 10 minutes on each video, it could take over 40 hours of manual work. 

**This workflow automates the localization of your YouTube metadata, making it fast and efficient to translate large volumes of content.** Instead of spending days on translations, you can handle bulk updates in minutes:
- **Save Time and Resources**: Instantly translate metadata for dozens or hundreds of videos, freeing you from repetitive, manual tasks.
- **Expand Your Global Reach**: Enable your videos to appear in search results across multiple languages, reaching new audiences worldwide.
- **Boost Engagement and SEO**: Localized metadata helps your videos get discovered and increases viewer engagement, leading to higher watch times and better performance.
- **Make Content More Accessible**: Welcome viewers from different linguistic backgrounds, making your channel inclusive and inviting. 

## Who Is This For?
Use cases are many: This workflow is perfect for YouTubers who want to automate multilingual metadata updates and eliminate repetitive manual tasks. It’s especially useful for creators whose content is visually driven and easy to follow, such as:
- DIY and How-to Channels
- Travel and Nature Channels
- Fitness and Workout Channels
- Cooking Channels
- Art and Craft Channels

## How It Works
### **Phase 1: Prepare Values & Auto Crawl Mode**
- **Set up a Schedule Trigger**: In the **Schedule Trigger** node in n8n, define your preferred interval to automatically run the workflow on a recurring schedule; no manual execution needed.
- **Set Required Parameters**: In the **Prepare Values** node in n8n, you must enter the following:
    - **spreadsheet_id**: to link the workflow to your connected Google Sheet
    - **channel_name**: to specify which tab of the Google Sheet contains the video URLs to process
    - **channel_id**: to define the YouTube channel the workflow will act upon
- **Set Target Languages**: In the **Languages** tab of your connected Google Sheet, list all languages you'd like to generate translated titles and descriptions for. These will be used later during the translation phase.
- **Choose Crawling Mode**: In the **Auto** tab of your Google Sheet, configure the **Auto Crawl** setting in **Column B** based on your preferred method:
    - Select **No** (Turn off **Auto Crawl**): You must manually input the video URL(s) in the **channel_name** tab and set the status to **Ready** for **1 video only**. 
    - Select **Yes** (Turn on **Auto Crawl**): The workflow will automatically fetch **one of the latest videos** from your connected YouTube channel (based on **channel_id**) into the **channel_name** tab in your Google Sheet. 

### **Phase 2: Trigger The Process**
- Once everything is properly set up, the workflow in n8n can be activated - either manually or automatically via the **Schedule Trigger**, which runs based on the interval you’ve configured earlier.
- The tool then checks the **Auto Crawl** status in **Column B** in the **Auto** tab of your connected Google Sheet to determine the route:
- If **Auto Crawl** = **No**: The workflow skips auto-fetching and proceeds directly to the next phase, expecting that the video URL is already entered manually and marked as **Ready** in its status.
- If **Auto Crawl** = **Yes**: The tool connects to your YouTube channel using the predefined **channel_id**. It fetches one of the latest videos and checks whether that video’s ID already exists in the list of processed videos. 
    - If the video **has not been processed yet**, its URL will be inserted into the **channel_name** tab, and its status in **Column A** will automatically be set to **Ready**, ensuring it proceeds to the next step.
    - If it **already exists**, the video is **skipped** to avoid reprocessing.


⚠️ **Important**: When **Auto Crawl** = **Yes**, do not manually add another URL and set its status to **Ready** in the **channel_name** tab in the Google Sheet. Doing so may trigger the same video twice, causing data conflicts and redundant processing.

### **Phase 3: Collect Video Information**
- Once a new video URL appears in your connected Google Sheet and its status is set **Ready** in **Column A** (under the specified **channel_name** tab), the workflow picks it up automatically.
- Then, it extracts the **Video ID** from the URL and sends a **GET** request to the **YouTube API** to retrieve that video’s title and description in your channel’s default language for the next steps.

### **Phase 4: Generate Translated Metadata In Preset Languages**
- The tool reads your target languages from the **Languages** tab in your connected Google Sheet.
- A loop runs through each language code one at a time.
- For each language, the tool sends your original title and description to **Google Gemini’s Chat Model**. Then, the AI returns the content translated into the target language.
- The output is returned in JSON data, then restructured to ensure each language’s data is clearly separated and ready for the next step.

### **Phase 5: Update Translated Metadata On YouTube & Log Status**
- All translated titles and descriptions from previous steps are combined into one structured format.
- The tool sends a **PUT** request to the **YouTube API** to update the video’s metadata directly with the new multilingual-translated content.
- If the update is successful, the video's status in **Column A** in the **channel_name** tab in the connected Google Sheet is marked as **Success**.
- If the update fails, the video’s status is marked as **Error** for later review or retry.

## How To Set Up
- Download the working package.
- Import the package into your n8n interface.
- Duplicate the [**Youtube - Update Video Metadata in Multi-Languages Google Sheet template**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/188bmZHGdao3yWwpHYAXTgLsweR4vpGBXpmx_d6MVtDs/edit?gid=1119232763#gid=1119232763) into your Google Sheets account. For the **channel_name** tab in the template, you can rename it with your actual YouTube channel's name for easier tracking. 
- Set up necessary credentials in Google Cloud Console for tools access and usability:
     - For Google Sheets access, please ensure connection in the following nodes:
     Node **Get Auto Crawl Status** → connected to the **Auto** tab
     Node **Check Latest Video ID** → connected to the **channel_name** tab
     Node **Insert Video Info** → connected to the **channel_name** tab
     Node **Get Video URL** → connected to the **channel_name** tab
     Node **Get Language List** → connected to the **Languages** tab
     Node **Update Status - Success** → connected to the **channel_name** tab
     Node **Update Status - Error** → connected to the **channel_name** tab
     - For YouTube access, ensure connection to **YouTube API** in the following nodes:
     Node **YouTube - Get Latest Video**
     Node **Get Video Info**
     Node **Update Video Metadata with Selected Languages**
     - For Google Gemini access, ensure connection to **Google Gemini API** in the following node:
     Node **Google Gemini’s Chat Model**
- Set a **Schedule Trigger** in n8n to run the workflow automatically at your preferred interval.
- Define necessary parameters in Node **Prepare Values** in your n8n workflow:
     - **spreadsheet_id**: your connected Google Sheet ID
     - **channel_name**: the tab in your connected Google Sheet contains the video URLs and receives process updates (should be renamed with your actual YouTube channel’s name for easy tracking)
     - **channel_id**: your YouTube channel ID
- Check the status of the **Auto Crawl** function in the **Auto** tab in your connected Google Sheet:
     + By default, its status is **No**: You’ll manually insert a video URL and mark its row as **Ready**.
     + In case you want to turn it on, please change it to **Yes**: The tool will automatically fetch the latest video(s) from your channel.
- Activate the workflow in n8n.
- To manually update a video:
     + Set **Auto Crawl** to **No**
     + Insert the video URL into the **channel_name** tab
     + Set the status to **Ready**
- To automate with **Auto Crawl**:
     + Set **Auto Crawl** to **Yes**
     + The tool will auto-fetch one of the new videos and set its status to **Ready**
- Track results of the original row in the **channel_name** tab of your Google Sheet and YouTube:
     + If the row’s status is **Success**, the metadata is updated on YouTube with all the set languages and you can check things out on the platform directly.
     + If the row’s status is **Error**, you can do manual review or retry.

## Requirements
- Basic setup in **Google Cloud Console** with **OAuth2** credentials in the following configurations:
    - **Google Sheets API** enabled, with edit permissions on the connected spreadsheet
    - **YouTube API** enabled, with an account that has Owner or Editor role on the target channel
- API access to **Google Gemini** for generating multilingual translated content via AI.

## How To Customize
- **Adjust the trigger interval**: Change the schedule in the **Schedule Trigger** node to fit your needs (e.g. every 10 minutes, hourly, etc.).
- **Add or remove target languages**: Simply update the **Languages** tab in your connected Google Sheet. No changes in n8n are required.
- **Customize the translation style**: You can edit the prompt inside the **AI** node to change the tone, format, or style of the translations. However, do not modify the output structure format - doing so will break the workflow.
- **Add alerts or notifications when finished**: Feel free to integrate additional nodes (like Telegram or Email) to notify you and your team when updates succeed or fail.

## FAQs:
### 1. Can I use this workflow for more than one YouTube channel?
Not directly. This workflow is currently designed to connect to a single YouTube channel ID at a time. However, if you’d like to manage multiple YouTube channels within one Google Sheet and a unified n8n interface, we can customize the setup for you. Feel  free to reach out to [**Agent Circle**](https://www.agentcircle.ai/) for a tailored setup and guidance.

### 2. What happens if I manually enter a video URL while Auto Crawl is ON?
Avoid this. Manually adding a URL with status **Ready** in the **channel_name** tab while **Auto Crawl** = **Yes** may cause duplicate processing, API conflicts, or data overwrites.

### 3. How many languages can I translate into at once?
There's no strict limit. You can list as many languages as needed in the **Languages** tab in your connected Google Sheet. Refer to the **All Languages** tab in the Google Sheet template for valid languages and language codes (e.g., en, fr, es, de).

### 4. Do I need to change anything in n8n when I add more languages?
No - simply update the **Languages** tab in your connected Google Sheet. No work in n8n is needed for this.

### 5. Can I change the AI model from Google Gemini to something else?
Yes. You can replace the **Google Gemini Chat Model** node with another chat model, such as **OpenAI GPT-4**, or any compatible LLM provider.

### 6. What happens if the metadata update to YouTube fails?
The video's status in **Column A** of the **channel_name** tab in your connected Google Sheet will be marked **Error**. You can then review, fix, and re-run the process. 

### 7. Can I edit the translation prompt in the AI node for my own brand tone?
Absolutely. You can customize the translation prompt in the AI node to adjust tone, format, or even brand voice. Just make sure the structure of the returned JSON remains intact.

### 8. Is the workflow GDPR or YouTube policy-compliant?
Yes - as long as you're the **owner** or have **editor** access to the YouTube channel and use the official YouTube API with proper OAuth2 authentication.

### 9. Can I schedule this workflow to run every day?
Yes. In the **Schedule Trigger** node in n8n, set your preferred interval - e.g., daily, every 12 hours, etc.

### 10. Does this work with unlisted or private videos?
No - YouTube API typically returns data only for public videos. For private/unlisted videos, additional permissions and scopes are required. If you need support for this case, feel free to contact [**Agent Circle**](https://www.agentcircle.ai/) for personalized consultation and setup assistance.
