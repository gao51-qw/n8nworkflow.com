## Pro Tips

**Response Time is King**: Every minute delayed reduces conversion by 10%. Use mobile notifications for reps.

**BANT Customization**: Adjust scoring weights based on your sales cycle. Enterprise may weight Authority higher, transactional sales may weight Timeline higher.

**Territory Conflicts**: Use round-robin within territories to prevent cherry-picking. Track conversion rates by rep.

**Lead Source Attribution**: Add hidden fields to Jotform to track UTM parameters and campaign sources.

**Continuous Improvement**: Monthly review of Google Sheets data to refine AI scoring thresholds.

**Rep Accountability**: Use 24-hour escalation data to identify training needs or workload issues.

**Disqualification Criteria**: Add automatic rejection for competitors, students, or leads outside serviceable areas.

**Integration Expansion**: Connect to calendar systems (Calendly, Chili Piper) for instant meeting booking.

**Lead Nurture Tracks**: Route cold leads to marketing automation (HubSpot sequences, Mailchimp campaigns).

**A/B Testing**: Try different form fields and AI prompts to optimize qualification accuracy.

**Mobile Optimization**: Ensure Jotform is mobile-friendly for leads submitting from phones.

**Follow-Up Sequences**: Add automated day 2, day 7, day 30 follow-ups for non-responsive leads.

**Competitive Intelligence**: Track which competitors are mentioned most, adjust positioning accordingly.

**Budget Realism Check**: AI can identify when stated budget doesn't match company size/needs.

**Multi-Product Routing**: For companies with multiple product lines, route based on interest.
