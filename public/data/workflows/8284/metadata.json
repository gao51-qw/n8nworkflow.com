  "description": "### WhatsApp Voice Agent with Twilio, VAPI, Google Calendar, Gmail & Supabase  \n\nThis workflow turns WhatsApp voice messages into an **AI assistant** using Twilio, VAPI, and modular MCP servers. It handles scheduling, email, and knowledge queries all by voice.  \n\n---\n\n### 🔎 How it works  \n1. **WhatsApp → Twilio → VAPI**  \n   - A WhatsApp Business number (via TwiML app) receives a voice message.  \n   - Twilio streams the audio into VAPI for processing.  \n2. **VAPI → n8n Webhook**  \n   - VAPI interprets the intent and routes the request to the correct MCP server.  \n3. **MCP Servers in n8n**  \n   - 📅 **Calendar MCP** → create, fetch, update, delete Google Calendar events  \n   - 📧 **Gmail MCP** → send confirmation or reminder emails  \n   - 📚 **Knowledge Base MCP** → query Supabase Vector Store with OpenAI embeddings  \n4. **n8n → VAPI → WhatsApp**  \n   - n8n executes the task and returns the result via VAPI back to the user.  \n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ How to use  \n- Import this workflow into your n8n instance.  \n- Configure a Twilio WhatsApp-enabled number and connect it to a TwiML app.  \n- Point the TwiML app to your VAPI project.  \n- Add credentials for Google Calendar, Gmail, Supabase, and OpenAI in n8n.  \n- Test by sending a WhatsApp voice command like:  \n  - “Book a meeting tomorrow at 3pm”  \n  - “Send a confirmation email to the client”  \n  - “What’s included in the AI receptionist package?”  \n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Customisation ideas  \n- Add more MCP servers (e.g. CRM, Notion, Slack).  \n- Swap Supabase for another vector database.  \n- Extend Gmail flows with templates or multiple senders.  \n- Adjust the VAPI assistant’s tone and role to fit your brand.  \n\n---\n\n### 📌 Requirements  \n- Twilio WhatsApp-enabled number + TwiML app (verified in WhatsApp Manager)  \n- VAPI project (assistant configured)  \n- n8n instance (Cloud or self-hosted)  \n- Google Calendar & Gmail credentials  \n- Supabase project  \n- OpenAI API key  \n\n---\n\n### 💡 Good to know  \n- Twilio must have a **verified WhatsApp Business number**.  \n- VAPI handles **voice infra + intent routing**; n8n only executes actions.  \n- The design is **modular**—easy to expand with new MCP servers.  \n- Works best when tested with short, clear commands.  \n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Use cases  \n- Hands-free scheduling with Google Calendar.  \n- Voice-triggered email confirmations & reminders.  \n- Conversational knowledge base access.  \n- Extendable to CRMs, team chat, or business workflows.  \n\n---\n\n👉 With this setup, you get a **scalable voice-first AI agent** on WhatsApp that connects seamlessly to your business systems.  \n",
