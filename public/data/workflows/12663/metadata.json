  "description": "## Overview\nThis n8n automation is a complete LinkedIn Content Engine that turns simple topic ideas into fully written, visual, and scheduled posts. It features a \"Human-in-the-Loop\" design, meaning AI handles the heavy lifting of writing and image creation, but nothing goes live until you manually approve it in Google Sheets.\n\n## How It Works\nThe system runs two separate workflows in parallel:\n\n### 1. The \"Creator\" Workflow\n\n**Input:** Detects when you add a new topic to your \"Content Calendar\" Google Sheet.\n\n**Brand Alignment:** Pulls your specific \"Brand Voice\" guidelines from a separate tab to ensure the AI sounds like you.\n\n**Creation:** Uses Gemini Flash 1.5 to write the post and DALL-E 3 to generate a matching professional image.\n\n**Drafting:** Uploads the image to ImgBB and saves the full draft back to your sheet with a status of \"Draft.\"\n\n### 2. The \"Publisher\" Workflow\n\n**Daily Scan:** Wakes up every morning to check your Content Calendar.\n\n**Verification:** Looks for posts that match two criteria:\n\n* Date Scheduled matches today's date.\n* Status is marked as \"Approved\" (by you).\n\n**Publishing:** If both match, it automatically uploads the text and image to LinkedIn and updates the sheet status to \"Posted.\"\n\n**Tools Used:** n8n, Google Sheets, OpenRouter (Gemini / OpenAI), ImgBB.\n\n## Connect & Learn More\n**YouTube Channel:** **[Simon Scrapes](https://www.youtube.com/@simonscrapes)** – More tutorials on AI & Automation.\n\n**Community:** **[Skool Community](https://www.skool.com/scrapes/about)** – Master AI & Automation with us.\n\n**Full Video Tutorial:** [Watch the step-by-step build here](https://youtu.be/eiIRSUhPgOI?si=lgZTrPZPMqWF4uqz&t=4276)",
