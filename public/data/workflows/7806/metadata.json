  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow automates LinkedIn community engagement by monitoring post comments, filtering new ones, generating AI-powered replies, and posting responses directly on LinkedIn. It also logs all interactions into Google Sheets for tracking and analytics.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**Trigger & Fetch**\n\n- A Schedule Trigger runs the workflow every 10 minutes.\n\n- The workflow fetches the latest comments on a specific LinkedIn post using LinkedIn’s API with token-based authentication.\n\n**Filter for New Comments**\n\n- Retrieves the timestamp of the last processed comment from Google Sheets.\n\n- Filters out previously handled comments, ensuring only fresh interactions are processed.\n\n**AI-Powered Reply Generation**\n\n- Sends the new comment to OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo with a structured prompt.\n\n- AI generates a professional, concise, and engaging LinkedIn-appropriate reply (max 2–3 sentences).\n\n**Post Back to LinkedIn**\n\n- Automatically posts the AI-generated reply under the original comment thread.\n\n- Maintains consistent formatting and actor identity.\n\n**Data Logging**\n\n- Appends the original comment, AI response, and metadata into Google Sheets.\n\n- Enables tracking, review, and future engagement analysis.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Saves time by automating LinkedIn comment replies.\n\n- Ensures responses are timely, professional, and on-brand.\n\n- Maintains authentic engagement without manual effort.\n\n- Prevents duplicate replies by filtering with timestamps.\n\n- Creates a structured log in Google Sheets for auditing and analytics.",
