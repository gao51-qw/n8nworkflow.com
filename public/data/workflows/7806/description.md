## How it works
This workflow automates LinkedIn community engagement by monitoring post comments, filtering new ones, generating AI-powered replies, and posting responses directly on LinkedIn. It also logs all interactions into Google Sheets for tracking and analytics.

## Step-by-step

**Trigger & Fetch**

- A Schedule Trigger runs the workflow every 10 minutes.

- The workflow fetches the latest comments on a specific LinkedIn post using LinkedIn’s API with token-based authentication.

**Filter for New Comments**

- Retrieves the timestamp of the last processed comment from Google Sheets.

- Filters out previously handled comments, ensuring only fresh interactions are processed.

**AI-Powered Reply Generation**

- Sends the new comment to OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo with a structured prompt.

- AI generates a professional, concise, and engaging LinkedIn-appropriate reply (max 2–3 sentences).

**Post Back to LinkedIn**

- Automatically posts the AI-generated reply under the original comment thread.

- Maintains consistent formatting and actor identity.

**Data Logging**
