## Generate Invoices for Customers with Jotform and QuickBooks 
This workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **QuickBooks Online (QBO)**, generating an invoice, and emailing it — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**).

## How It Works
1. **Receive Submission**
* Triggered when a user submits a form.
* Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.

2. **Check If Customer Exists**
* Searches QBO to determine if the customer already exists.
* **If Customer Exists:** **Update** customer details (e.g., billing address).
* **If Customer Doesn’t Exist:** **Create** a new customer in QBO.

3. **Get The Item**
* Retrieves the selected product or service from QBO.

4. **Create The Invoice**
* Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.

5. **Send The Invoice**
* Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.

## Who Can Benefit from This Workflow?
* **Freelancers**
* **Service Providers**
* **Consultants & Coaches**
* **Small Businesses**
* **E-commerce or Custom Product Sellers**
