# Smart Contract Event Monitor (Web3)

This workflow automatically monitors the Ethereum blockchain, extracts USDT transfer events, filters large-value transactions, stores them in Airtable and sends a clean daily summary alert to Slack.

This workflow checks the latest Ethereum block every day and identifies high-value USDT transfers. It fetches on-chain logs using Alchemy, extracts sender/receiver/value details, filters transactions above a threshold, stores them in Airtable and finally sends a single clear summary alert to Slack.

You receive:

*   Daily blockchain check (automated)
*   Airtable tracking of all high-value USDT transfers
*   A Slack alert summarizing the count + the largest transfer

Ideal for teams wanting simple, automated visibility of suspicious or large crypto movements without manually scanning the blockchain.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1.  Add your **Alchemy Ethereum Mainnet API URL** in both HTTP nodes.
2.  Connect and configure your **Airtable** base & table.
3.  Connect your **Slack** credentials and set the channel for alerts.
4.  Adjust the **value threshold** in the IF node (default: 1,000,000,000).
5.  Activate the workflow — daily monitoring begins instantly.


## What It Does

This workflow automates detection of high-value USDT transfers on Ethereum:

1.  Fetches the latest block number using Alchemy.
2.  Retrieves all USDT Transfer logs from that block.
3.  Extracts structured data:
    *   Sender
    *   Receiver
    *   Amount
    *   Contract
    *   Block number
    *   Transaction hash
4.  Filters only transactions above a configurable threshold.
5.  Saves each high-value transaction into Airtable for record-keeping.
6.  Generates a summary including:
    *   Total number of high-value transfers
    *   The single largest transfer
7.  Sends one clean alert message to Slack.
    
This ensures visibility of suspicious or large fund movements with no repeated alerts.

## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

*   Crypto analytics teams
*   Blockchain monitoring platforms
*   Compliance teams tracking high-value activity
*   Web3 product teams
*   Developers needing automated USDT transfer tracking
*   Anyone monitoring whale movements / suspicious transactions


## Requirements to Use This Workflow

To run this workflow, you need:

*   **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)
*   **Alchemy API URL** (Ethereum Mainnet)
*   **Airtable base** + Personal Access Token
*   **Slack workspace** with API permissions
*   Basic understanding of Ethereum logs, hex values & JSON data
    

## How It Works

1.  **Daily Check** – Workflow runs automatically at your set time.
2.  **Get Latest Block Number** – Fetches newest Ethereum block from Alchemy.
3.  **Fetch USDT Logs** – Queries all Transfer events (ERC-20 standard).
4.  **Extract Transaction Details** – Converts hex → readable data.
5.  **Filter High-Value Transactions** – Keeps only large value transfers.
6.  **Save to Airtable** – Adds each transfer record to your database.
7.  **Generate Summary** – Finds the largest transfer & total count.
8.  **Send Slack Alert** – Notifies your team with one clean summary.
    

## Setup Steps

1.  Import the provided n8n JSON file.
2.  Open the **Get Latest Block** and **Fetch Logs** HTTP nodes → add your **Alchemy API URL**.
3.  Ensure USDT contract address (already included):0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7
4.  Connect your **Airtable** account and map:
    *   Contract
    *   From Address
    *   To Address
    *   Value
    *   Block Number
    *   txHash
5.  Connect **Slack API** credentials and choose your channel.
6.  Change the threshold limit in the IF node if needed (default: 1B).
7.  Activate the workflow — done!
    

## How To Customize Nodes

### Customize Value Threshold

Modify the **IF** node:

*   Increase or decrease the minimum transfer value
*   Change logic to smaller or larger whale-tracking
    

### Customize Airtable Storage

You can add fields like:

*   Timestamp
*   Token symbol
*   USD price (using price API)
*   Transaction status
*   Risk classification
    

### Customize Slack Alerts

You may add:

*   Emojis
*   Mentions (@channel, @team)
*   Links to Etherscan
*   Highlighted blocks for critical transfers
    

### Customize Web3 Provider

Replace Alchemy with:

*   Infura
*   QuickNode
*   Public RPC (not recommended for reliability)
    

## Add-Ons (Optional Enhancements)

You can extend this workflow to:

*   Track multiple ERC-20 tokens
*   Process several blocks instead of just the latest
*   Add price conversion (USDT → USD value)
*   Detect transfers to suspicious wallets
*   Generate daily or weekly summary reports in Slack
*   Create a dashboard using Airtable Interfaces
*   Add OpenAI-based insights (large spike, suspicious pattern, etc.)
    

## Use Case Examples

### 1\. Whale Tracking

Detect large USDT movements (&gt;1M or &gt;5M).

### 2\. Compliance Monitoring

Log high-value transfers in Airtable for audits.

### 3\. Real-Time Alerts

Slack alerts tell your team instantly about big movements.

### 4\. On-Chain Analytics

Automate structured extraction of Ethereum logs.

### 5\. Exchange Monitoring

Detect large inflows/outflows to known addresses.

|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| No data in Airtable    | Logs returned empty                | Ensure USDT transfer events exist in that block          |
| Values are “zero”      | Hex parsing failed                 | Check extract-code logic                                 |
| Slack alert not sent   | Invalid credentials                | Update Slack API key                                     |
| Airtable error         | Wrong field names                  | Match Airtable column names exactly                      |
| HTTP request fails     | Wrong RPC URL                      | Re-check Alchemy API key                                 |
| Workflow not running   | Schedule disabled                  | Enable "Daily Check" node                                |
