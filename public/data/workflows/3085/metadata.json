  "description": "This workflow automates the process of creating a **complete SEO-optimized blog post**, including generating content, titles, images, and meta tags, and publishing it on WordPress. It leverages **AI models** (like DeepSeek and OpenRouter) for content generation and SEO optimization, and integrates with **Google Sheets**, **WordPress**, and **OpenAI** for image generation. \n\nThis is a powerful tool for automating the creation and optimization of blog posts, saving time and ensuring high-quality, SEO-friendly content. It integrates multiple tools and AI models to deliver a seamless content creation experience.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to streamline the creation of SEO-friendly blog posts. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** node, which initiates the process when the user clicks \"Test workflow.\"\n2. **Fetch Context**: The **Google Sheets** node retrieves the blog post context (e.g., topic, keywords) from a predefined Google Sheet.\n3. **Generate Content**:\n   - The **Generate Article** node uses an AI model (DeepSeek) to create an SEO-friendly blog post based on the fetched context.\n   - The **Generate Title** node creates a compelling, keyword-rich title for the blog post.\n4. **Publish to WordPress**:\n   - The **Add Draft to WP** node creates a draft post in WordPress with the generated content and title.\n5. **Generate and Upload Image**:\n   - The **Generate Image** node uses OpenAI to create a realistic, blog-appropriate image.\n   - The **Upload Image** node uploads the image to WordPress media.\n   - The **Set Image** node associates the uploaded image as the featured image for the blog post.\n6. **SEO Optimization**:\n   - The **SEO Expert** node analyzes the blog post and generates optimized meta titles and descriptions using an AI model (OpenRouter).\n   - The **Set Metatag** node updates the WordPress post with the generated meta tags.\n7. **Update Google Sheets**:\n   - The **Update Sheet** and **Finish Work** nodes update the Google Sheet with the post's details, including the URL, title, and metadata.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Google Sheets Setup**:\n   - Create a Google Sheet with columns for **ID POST**, **PROMPT**, **TITLE**, **URL**, **METATITLE**, and **METADESCRIPTION**.\n   - Link the Google Sheet to the **Get Context** node by providing the **Document ID** and **Sheet Name**.\n\n2. **WordPress Integration**:\n   - Set up WordPress credentials in n8n for the **Add Draft to WP**, **Upload Image**, and **Set Image** nodes.\n   - Ensure the WordPress site is accessible via its REST API.\n\n3. **AI Model Configuration**:\n   - Configure the **DeepSeek** and **OpenRouter** credentials in n8n for the **Generate Article**, **Generate Title**, and **SEO Expert** nodes.\n   - Ensure the AI models are correctly set up to generate content and meta tags.\n\n4. **Image Generation**:\n   - Set up OpenAI credentials for the **Generate Image** node to create blog post images.\n\n5. **Meta Tag Optimization**:\n   - The **SEO Expert** node uses OpenRouter to generate meta titles and descriptions. Ensure the node is configured to analyze the blog post content and produce SEO-friendly tags.\n\n6. **Workflow Execution**:\n   - Click the **\"Test workflow\"** button to trigger the workflow.\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Fetch the blog post context from Google Sheets.\n     - Generate the article, title, and image.\n     - Publish the draft to WordPress.\n     - Upload and set the featured image.\n     - Generate and apply meta tags.\n     - Update the Google Sheet with the post details.\n\n7. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional SEO optimizations, such as internal linking, keyword density analysis, or social media sharing.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
