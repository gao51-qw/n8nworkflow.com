  "description": "![Workflow_Screenshot.png](fileId:1559)\n\n//ASMR AI Workflow \n### Who is this for?\n\nContent Creators, YouTube Automation Enthusiasts, and AI Hobbyists looking to autonomously generate and publish unique, satisfying ASMR-style YouTube Shorts without manual effort.\n\n### What problem does this solve?\n\nThis workflow solves the creative bottleneck and time-consuming nature of daily content creation. It fully automates the entire production pipeline, from brainstorming trendy ideas to publishing a finished video, turning your n8n instance into a 24/7 content factory.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n**1. Two-Stage AI Ideation & Planning:**\n*   Uses an initial AI agent to brainstorm a short, viral ASMR concept based on current trends.\n*   A second \"Planning\" AI agent then takes this concept and expands it into a detailed, structured production plan, complete with a viral-optimized caption, hashtags, and descriptions for the environment and sound.\n\n**2. Multi-Modal Asset Generation:**\n*   **Video:** Feeds detailed scene prompts to the **ByteDance Seedance** text-to-video model (via Wavespeed AI) to generate high-quality video clips.\n*   **Audio:** Simultaneously calls the **Fal AI** text-to-audio model to create custom, soothing ASMR sound effects that match the video's theme.\n*   **Assembly:** Automatically sequences the video clips and sound into a single, cohesive final video file using an FFMPEG API call.\n\n**3. Closed-Loop Publishing & Logging:**\n*   **Logging:** Initially logs the new idea to a Google Sheet with a status of \"In Progress\".\n*   **Publishing:** Automatically uploads the final, assembled video directly to your YouTube channel, setting the title and description from the AI's plan.\n*   **Updating:** Finds the original row in the Google Sheet and updates its status to \"Done\", adding a direct link to the newly published YouTube video.\n*   **Notifications:** Sends real-time alerts to Telegram and/or Gmail with the video title and link, confirming the successful publication.\n\n### Setup\n\n**Credentials:**\nYou will need to create credentials in your n8n instance for the following services:\n*   OpenAI API\n*   Wavespeed AI API (for Seedance)\n*   Fal AI API\n*   Google OAuth Credential (enable **YouTube Data API v3** and **Google Sheets API** in your Google Cloud Project)\n*   Telegram Bot Credential\n*   (Optional) Gmail OAuth Credential\n\n**Configuration:**\nThis is an advanced workflow. The initial setup should take approximately 15-20 minutes.\n*   **Google Sheet:** Create a Google Sheet with these columns: `idea`, `caption`, `production_status`, `youtube_url`. Add the **Sheet ID** to the Google Sheets nodes in the workflow.\n*   **Node Configuration:** In the `Telegram Notification` node, enter your own `Chat ID`. In the `Gmail Notification` node, update the recipient email address.\n*   **Activate:** Once configured, save and set the workflow to \"Active\" to let it run on its schedule.\n\n### How to customize\n\n*   **Creative Direction:** To change the style or theme of the videos (e.g., from kinetic sand to soap cutting), simply edit the `systemMessage` in the **\"2. Enrich Idea into Plan\"** and **\"Prompts AI Agent\"** nodes.\n\n*   **Initial Ideas:** To influence the AI's starting concepts, modify the prompt in the **\"1. Generate Trendy Idea\"** node.\n*   **Video & Sound:** To change the video duration or sound style, adjust the parameters in the **\"Create Clips\"** and **\"Create Sounds\"** nodes.\n*   **Notifications:** Add or remove notification channels (like Slack or Discord) after the **\"Upload to YouTube\"** node.\n",
