# 🧹 Auto-Clean CSV Uploads Before Import  

This workflow automatically **cleans, validates, and standardizes any CSV file** you upload. Perfect for preparing customer lists, sales leads, product catalogs, or any messy datasets before pushing them into Google Sheets, Google Drive, or other systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **CSV Upload (Webhook)**  
   - Upload your CSV via webhook (supports **form-data**, **base64**, or binary file upload).  
   - Handles files up to ~10MB comfortably.  

2. **Extract & Parse**  
   - Reads raw CSV content.  
   - Validates file structure and headers.  
   - Detects and normalizes column names (e.g. `First Name` → `first_name`).  

3. **Clean & Standardize Data**  
   - **Removes duplicate rows** (based on email or all fields).  
   - **Deletes empty rows**.  
   - **Standardizes fields**:  
     - Emails → lowercased, validated format.  
     - Phone numbers → normalized `(xxx) xxx-xxxx` or `+1 format`.  
     - Names → capitalized (John Smith).  
     - Text → trims spaces & fixes inconsistent spacing.  
   - Assigns each row a **data quality score** so you know how “clean” it is.  

4. **Generate Cleaned CSV**  
   - Produces a cleaned CSV file with the same headers.  
   - Saves to Google Drive (optional).  
   - Ready for immediate import into Sheets or any app.  

5. **Google Sheets Integration (Optional)**  
   - Clears out an existing sheet.  
   - Re-imports the cleaned rows.  
   - Perfect for always keeping your “master sheet” clean.  

6. **Final Report**  
   - Logs processing summary:  
     - Rows before & after cleaning.  
     - Duplicates removed.  
     - Low-quality rows removed.  
     - Average data quality score.  
   - Outputs a neat summary for auditing.

## 🛠️ Setup Steps  

1. **Upload Method**  
   - Use the webhook endpoint generated by the `CSV Upload Webhook` node.  
   - Send CSV via binary upload, base64 encoding, or JSON payload with `csv_content`.  

2. **Google Drive (Optional)**  
   - Connect your Drive OAuth credentials.  
   - Replace `YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` with your target folder.  

3. **Google Sheets (Optional)**  
   - Connect Google Sheets OAuth.  
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` with your target sheet ID.  

4. **Customize Cleaning Rules**  
   - Adjust the `Clean & Standardize Data` code node if you want different cleaning thresholds (default = 30% minimum data quality).
