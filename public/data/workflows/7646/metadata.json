  "description": "\n## Since the **Get Many Subreddit** node often blocks requests because Reddit requires proper authentication headers, this workflow provides a reliable alternative. It uses the **Reddit OAuth2 API** through the HTTP Request node, processes the results, and outputs cleaned subreddit data.\n\nIf you are using Get Many subreddit node and you are getting this **error: *n8n You've been blocked by network security.To continue, log in to your Reddit account or use your developer token***\n\nUsecase: This is especially useful if you want to search multiple subreddits programmatically and apply filtering for members, descriptions, and categories.\n\n\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger Input**\n\n   * The workflow is designed to be called by another workflow using the **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.\n   * Input is passed in JSON format with parameters:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Query\": \"RealEstateTechnology\",\n       \"min_members\": 0,\n       \"max_members\": 20000,\n       \"limit\": 50\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Fetch Subreddits**\n\n   * The **HTTP Request (Reddit OAuth2)** node queries the Reddit API (`/subreddits/search`) with the given keyword and limit.\n   * Because it uses OAuth2 credentials, the request is properly authenticated and accepted by Reddit.\n\n3. **Process Results**\n\n   * **Split Out**: Iterates over each subreddit entry (`data.children`).\n   * **Edit Fields**: Extracts the following fields for clarity:\n\n     * Subreddit URL\n     * Description\n     * 18+ flag\n     * Member count\n   * **Aggregate**: Recombines the processed data into a structured output array.\n\n4. **Output**\n\n   * Returns a cleaned dataset with only the relevant subreddit details.(Saves token if Attached to an AI Agent)\n\n\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Import this workflow into **n8n**.\n2. In your main workflow, replace the **Get Many Subreddit** node with an **Execute Workflow** node and select this workflow.\n3. Pass in the required query parameters (`Query`, `min_members`, `max_members`, `limit`).\n4. Run your main workflow — results will now come through authenticated API requests without being blocked.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **Reddit OAuth2 API Credentials** (must be set up in n8n under *Credentials*).\n* Basic understanding of **JSON parameters** in n8n.\n* An existing workflow that calls this one using **Execute Workflow**.\n\n---\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n\nYou can adapt this workflow to your specific needs by:\n\n* **Filtering by member range:** Add logic to exclude subreddits outside `min_members` or `max_members`.\n* **Expanding extracted fields:** Include additional subreddit properties such as `created_utc`, `lang`, or `active_user_count`.\n* **Changing authentication:** Switch to different Reddit OAuth2 credentials if managing multiple Reddit accounts.\n* **Integrating downstream apps:** Send the processed subreddit list to Google Sheets, Airtable, or a database for storage.\n",
