### Who this is for?
Extract & Summarize Indeed Company Info is an automated workflow that extracts the Indeed company profile information using Bright Data Web Unlocker, transform it using Google Gemini’s LLM, and forward the transformed response with the summary to a specified webhook for downstream use.

This workflow is tailored for:

- Recruiters and HR teams looking to assess companies quickly during talent sourcing.

- Job seekers researching potential employers and needing summarized company insights.

- Market researchers and analysts monitoring competitor or industry players.

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Searching and evaluating company profiles on Indeed manually can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when dealing with large volumes of companies. Manually browsing, copying, and summarizing company descriptions, reviews, and ratings from Indeed hinders productivity and limits real-time insights.

This workflow solves this by:

- Automating the extraction of company details from Indeed using Bright Data Web Unlocker.

- Summarizing the raw data using Google Gemini's language model for a quick, human-readable overview.

- Sending the transformed response with the summary to a chosen endpoint, like Slack, Notion, Airtable, or a custom webhook.

### What this workflow does

This automated pipeline does the following:

- Scrape Indeed company profile pages (e.g., ratings, description, reviews) using Bright Data’s Web Unlocker.

- Transform the scraped content into structured JSON using n8n’s built-in tools.

- Summarize and extract meaningful insights using Google Gemini's large language model.

- Forward the summarized data to a specified webhook or app for real-time access, storage, or analysis.
