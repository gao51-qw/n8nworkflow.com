## How it works
This workflow scrapes the latest Artificial Intelligence articles from TechCrunch, then processes and classifies the content using OpenAI and LangChain nodes. The final result is saved to Google Sheets and sent as a summary to a Telegram group.

Workflow Logic:

Scraper: Extracts URLs and publish dates from TechCrunch's AI category.

Filter: Only continues if the article is from yesterday (to avoid duplication).

Content Fetch: Downloads and extracts article body text.

AI Agent:

Categorizes the news into one of 9 predefined categories.

Output:

Saves all structured data to Google Sheets.

Sends a summary to a Telegram group.
