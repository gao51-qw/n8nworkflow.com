## 🎛️ Customization Guidance

- **Delivery Methods**: Add Slack, Email, or Google Sheets nodes to automatically share the digest with your team.  
- **Automation Frequency**: Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily, weekly, or at custom intervals.  
- **Extended Analysis**: Modify the prompt to include sentiment analysis, top keywords, or executive summaries.  
- **Multi-Query Runs**: Duplicate the SerpApi node to monitor multiple industries or competitors in one workflow.
