This n8n template demonstrates how to download multiple PDF files from public URLs and merge them into a single PDF using the PDF Toolkit from www.customjs.space.

[@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit)

### Notice

Community nodes can only be installed on self-hosted instances of n8n.

### What this workflow does

- **Downloads** each PDF using an HTTP Request.
- **Populates** files into an array with **Merge** node from n8n.
- **Merges** all downloaded PDFs using the Merge PDF node from the @custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit.
- **Writes** the final merged PDF to disk.

### Requirements

- **Self-hosted** n8n instance
- **CustomJS API key** for merging multiple PDF files.
- **PDF files to be merged** to be converted into a PDF

### Workflow Steps:

1. **Manual Trigger**:

   - Runs with user interaction.

2. **HTTP Request Node For PDF Download**:

   - Pass urls for PDF files to merge.

3. **Merge Node For Array Population**:

   - Just populates two files into an array.

4. **Merge PDF files**:
   - Uses the **CustomJS** node to merge the incoming PDF files into a single PDF file.
   - If size of PDF files exceeds 6MB, you can simply pass an array of URLs for PDF files.

### Design workflow

- A Manual Trigger for starting workflow.
- Two HTTP Request Nodes for downloading PDF files.
- A Merge Node for populating files as an array.
- Merge PDFs node for merging files
- Write to Disk node for saving merged PDF file.

You can replace logic for triggering and returning results.
For example, you can trigger this workflow by calling a webhook and get a result as a response from webhook. Simply replace Manual Trigger and Write to Disk nodes.

### Perfect for

- Bundling reports or invoices.
- Generating document sets from external sources.
- Automating PDF handling without writing custom code
