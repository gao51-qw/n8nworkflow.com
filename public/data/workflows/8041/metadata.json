  "description": "# 💼 Auto-Sync LinkedIn Connections to Google Sheets (Apify + n8n)\n\nThis workflow automatically **scrapes your LinkedIn connections using Apify**, processes the data, and logs it into a structured **Google Sheet** every week. It also generates a summary of top companies, locations, and industries across your network.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Weekly Sync (Sunday 2 AM)**  \n   - A **Cron node** triggers the workflow weekly (default: Sunday at 2 AM).  \n   - Frequency can be adjusted.  \n\n2. **Start LinkedIn Scrape**  \n   - Calls the **Apify LinkedIn Scraper Actor** with your credentials.  \n   - Initiates a scraping run for all your LinkedIn connections.  \n\n3. **Extract Run ID & Wait**  \n   - Extracts the scrape run ID from Apify’s response.  \n   - Waits 30 seconds before checking status (retries every 60s until completed).  \n\n4. **Check Scrape Status**  \n   - Confirms if the scrape has finished successfully.  \n   - If not completed, waits and retries until done.  \n\n5. **Get Scraped Data**  \n   - Fetches scraped connection data from the Apify dataset.  \n   - Includes fields like name, title, company, location, industry, mutual connections, and profile URL.  \n\n6. **Process Connections Data**  \n   - A **Code node** cleans and normalizes the scraped data.  \n   - Removes incomplete profiles, trims whitespace, merges duplicate fields.  \n\n7. **Save to Google Sheets**  \n   - Clears existing data and appends the latest connections to your Google Sheet.  \n   - Headers include:  \n     ```\n     Name | Title | Company | Location | Profile URL \n     Connection Date | Industry | Mutual Connections\n     ```  \n\n8. **Generate Sync Summary**  \n   - Analyzes all saved connections.  \n   - Produces quick stats:  \n     - Total connections synced  \n     - Top 5 companies  \n     - Top 5 locations  \n     - Industry breakdown  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Apify Setup\n- Sign up at [apify.com](https://apify.com).  \n- Get your **API token** from account settings.  \n- Use the **LinkedIn Scraper Actor**.  \n- Add your **LinkedIn session cookies** for stable results.  \n\n⚠️ Respect LinkedIn’s Terms of Service.  \n\n### 2. Google Sheets\n- Create a Google Sheet with headers:  \nName | Title | Company | Location | Profile URL | Connection Date | Industry | Mutual Connections\n- Copy the **Sheet ID** from the URL.  \n- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in the workflow.  \n\n### 3. Credentials\n- Add **Apify API Token** as an HTTP header credential in n8n.  \n- Connect your Google Sheets OAuth account.  \n\n### 4. Scheduling\n- Default: runs every **Sunday at 2 AM**.  \n- Modify the Cron node to adjust frequency.  \n\n---\n\n## 📊 Example Output (Google Sheets Row)\n\n| Name        | Title                  | Company       | Location      | Profile URL              | Connection Date | Industry   | Mutual Connections |\n|-------------|------------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------|--------------------|\n| Jane Smith  | Marketing Director     | Acme Corp     | New York, US | linkedin.com/in/janesmith | 2025-08-25     | Marketing  | 12                 |\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Example Sync Summary\n\n✅ LinkedIn sync completed: 248 connections saved\n🏢 Top companies: Acme Corp, Deloitte, Google, Meta, Amazon\n🌍 Top locations: New York, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Toronto\n📌 Industries: Marketing (32), Tech (45), Finance (28), Consulting (20)\n\n---\n\n⚡ With this workflow, your LinkedIn connections stay automatically logged and analyzed — ready for outreach, reporting, or CRM import.\n",
