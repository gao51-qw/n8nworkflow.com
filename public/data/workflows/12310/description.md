# Add LinkedIn Post Commenters to HubSpot CRM

## Who's it for

This workflow is built for content creators, sales professionals, founders, and marketers who post regularly on LinkedIn and want to convert engaged commenters into CRM leads automatically. Perfect for anyone who gets decent engagement on their posts but struggles to manually capture and follow up with everyone who comments.

If you're running thought leadership campaigns, generating inbound interest through content, or simply want to build relationships with people who engage with your posts, this automation captures every commenter and enriches them with full professional data before syncing to your CRM.

## How it works

The workflow automatically captures LinkedIn post commenters and adds them to HubSpot CRM with enriched professional data.

**The process flow:**
1. Submit a LinkedIn post URL via a simple form trigger
2. ConnectSafely.ai fetches all comments from the specified post
3. Splits commenters into individual records for processing
4. Loops through each commenter one at a time
5. Apify actor enriches each profile with complete LinkedIn data (email, company, title, location)
6. Email validation filters contacts - only those with valid emails proceed
7. HubSpot integration creates or updates contacts with full enriched information
8. Loop continues until all commenters are processed

## Customization

### Additional HubSpot Fields

The **Create or update a contact** node maps these fields by default:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Job Title
- Company Name
- City
- Country
- Street Address

To add more fields:
1. Open the **Create or update a contact** node
2. Click **Add Field** under Additional Fields
3. Map Apify output fields to HubSpot properties

Available Apify fields include:
- `06_Linkedin_url` - LinkedIn profile URL
- `07_Title` - Current job title
- `08_Summary` - Profile summary
- `16_Company_name` - Current company
- `17_Company_industry` - Industry

### Add Lead Source Tracking

To track that these contacts came from LinkedIn comments:
1. Open the **Create or update a contact** node
2. Add a custom field: `leadSource` = `LinkedIn Post Comment`
3. Optionally add the post URL as a note

### Filter by Comment Quality

Want to skip low-effort comments like "Great post!" or emoji-only responses?
1. Add an **IF** node after **📤 Split Comments Array**
2. Filter based on comment text length or content
3. Only process comments with meaningful engagement

### Different CRM Integration

To use a different CRM instead of HubSpot:
1. Delete the **Create or update a contact** node
2. Add your CRM node (Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, etc.)
3. Map the enriched fields to your CRM's contact properties
4. Connect it to the "Check if Contact is eligible" true output

### Add Slack Notifications

Get notified when high-value commenters are captured:
1. Add a Slack node after **Create or update a contact**
2. Filter for specific job titles (VP, Director, CEO, etc.)
3. Send a message to your sales channel with commenter details

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: ConnectSafely node not appearing in n8n
- **Solution**: Restart n8n after installing the community node. If still missing, verify the installation in Settings → Community Nodes.

**Issue**: "Comments not loading" or empty results
- **Solution**: Ensure the post URL is the full URL from LinkedIn (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/posts/username_activity-1234567890/`), not a shortened version. Also verify the post actually has comments.

**Issue**: Apify enrichment returning empty results
- **Solution**: Verify the LinkedIn URL format from the commenter profile is correct. Check your Apify actor is running properly and hasn't hit rate limits.

**Issue**: HubSpot contact not created
- **Solution**: Check that your HubSpot App Token has `crm.objects.contacts.write` scope enabled. Verify the email field is mapping correctly.

**Issue**: Duplicate contacts in HubSpot
- **Solution**: HubSpot uses email as the unique identifier. The node is configured to "Create or Update" so duplicates should be updated, not created.

**Issue**: Rate limit errors from Apify
- **Solution**: The loop processes one commenter at a time, but you can add a **Wait** node inside the loop with 2-5 second delays if needed.

**Issue**: Missing email addresses for most commenters
- **Solution**: This is normal - enrichment typically finds emails for 60-70% of profiles. Consider adding LinkedIn URL as a fallback identifier in your CRM.
