  "description": "# What it is\nThis n8n workflow monitors Reddit for posts relevant to a specific business or industry, identifies potential leads, and delivers them directly to your inbox.\n\nFull tutorial (https://findleads.agency/blog/n8n-ai-agent-for-lead-generation-using-reddit-openai-gmail)  for those wanting to build it themselves.\n\n# How It Works\n1. A user submits their website URL and email through a form\n2. The workflow analyzes the website to determine the industry and extract relevant keywords\n3. It searches Reddit for posts containing those keywords and filters them based on custom engagement metrics (i.e. upvotes &gt; 15, non-empty text content, posted within the last 90 days)\n4. An AI agent (using OpenRouter's GPT-4.1-mini) analyzes each post to determine relevance and summarizes the key points\n5. Relevant posts are stored in Google Sheets and formatted into a professional HTML email\n6. The email is sent to the user's provided email address with a summary of potential leads\n\n# Setup\nTo run this workflow, you need to set up credentials in n8n for:\n\n- Reddit: Uses OAuth 2.0. Requires creating an app on Reddit to get a Client ID & Secret. (YT Tutorial for Reddit App Creation: https://youtu.be/zlGXtW4LAK8)\n- OpenRouter: Uses an API Key. Generate this key directly from your OpenRouter account settings. (YT Tutorial: https://youtu.be/Cq5Y3zpEhlc)\n- Google Sheets: Recommend OAuth2 (just connect by authenticating) or setup in Google Cloud Console (enable Sheets API, create OAuth Client ID with n8n redirect URI) to get a Client ID & Secret.\n- Gmail: Uses OAuth 2.0. Requires setup in Google Cloud Console to enable Gmail API and create OAuth credentials.",
