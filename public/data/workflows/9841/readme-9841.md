## Pro Tips

**Test with Multiple Scenarios**: Submit applications with various income/debt combinations to validate routing logic works correctly

**Adjust DTI Thresholds for Loan Type**: Conventional mortgages: 43% max. FHA loans: 50% max. Auto loans: 35-40% max. Personal loans: 40-45% max.

**Credit Score Tiers Matter**: Build rate sheets with score tiers (740+: prime, 680-739: near-prime, 620-679: subprime, below 620: denied or hard money)

**Income Verification Priorities**: W-2 employees (easy), self-employed (complex), commission/bonus heavy (average 2 years), rental income (75% counts), gig economy (difficult)

**Document Checklist Customization**: Vary required docs by loan type, amount, and risk profile to avoid over-documentation for low-risk loans

**Conditional Approval vs Outright Denial**: When in doubt, use conditional - gives applicants path to approval and keeps them in pipeline

**Adverse Action Notices**: For denials, include specific reasons (per FCRA requirements) and instructions for disputing credit report errors

**Pre-Qualification vs Pre-Approval**: Pre-qual uses soft credit pull (no impact on score), pre-approval uses hard pull (official decision)

**Co-Borrower Logic**: When DTI is high, automatically suggest co-borrower as option to strengthen application

**Rate Lock Automation**: Pre-approved applications should include rate lock expiration date (typically 30-60 days)

**Property Appraisal Triggers**: Auto-order appraisals for pre-approved mortgage applications to keep process moving

**Underwriter Dashboard**: Build Google Sheets dashboard with filters for underwriters to sort by approval status, loan amount, date

**Compliance Monitoring**: Regular audits of AI decisions to ensure no discriminatory patterns (disparate impact analysis)

**Customer Service Integration**: Link application IDs to support tickets so agents can quickly pull up loan status

**Marketing Attribution**: Track lead sources in form to measure which marketing channels produce best-quality applicants
