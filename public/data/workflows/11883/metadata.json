  "description": "**Overview**\n\nThis workflow turns audio attachments you receive by Gmail into Japanese transcripts and structured AI summaries, then saves everything to Google Drive and Google Sheets while notifying you via Gmail and Slack. Every time an email with a voice recording arrives, the audio is stored in a dated folder, fully transcribed in Japanese, summarized into clear meeting-style points, and logged so you can quickly review and search later. \n\nAudio Email to Japanese Transcr…\n\nAudio Email to Japanese Transcript with AI Summary & Multi-Channel Notification\n\n**Who this is for**\n\nPeople who get voice memos or meeting recordings as email attachments\n\nTeams that want clear Japanese transcripts plus action-item summaries from calls\n\nAnyone who wants audio notes automatically archived and searchable in Drive/Sheets\n\n**How it works**\n\nTrigger: New Gmail with audio attachment\nA Gmail Trigger watches your inbox, downloads attachments for each new email, and passes them into the workflow.\n\nSplit & filter attachments\nA Code node splits the email into one item per attachment and normalizes the binary data to binary.data.\nA Filter node keeps only audio files (mp3, wav, m4a, ogg) and discards everything else.\n\nCreate date-based Drive folder & upload audio\nA Code node builds a YYYY/MM folder path from the current date.\nA Google Drive node creates that folder (if it doesn’t exist) under your chosen parent folder.\nA Merge node combines folder info with file info, and the audio file is uploaded into that folder so all recordings are organized by year/month.\n\nTranscribe audio to Japanese text\nAn HTTP Request node calls the OpenAI Audio Transcriptions API (gpt-4o-transcribe) with the audio file.\nThe prompt tells the model to produce a verbatim Japanese transcript (no summarization, no guessing), returned as plain text.\n\nGenerate structured AI summary\nThe transcript is sent to an OpenAI Chat node (gpt-4o), which outputs JSON with:\n\ntitle: short Japanese title for the recording\n\npoints: key discussion points (array)\n\ndecisions: decisions made (array)\n\nactionItems: action items with owner/deadline (array)\nA Set node then formats this JSON into a Markdown summary (summaryContent) with sections for 要点 / 決定事項 / アクションアイテム.\n\nSave transcript & summary files to Drive\nThe transcript text is converted into a .txt file and uploaded to the same YYYY/MM folder.\nThe Markdown summary is converted into a .md file (e.g. xxx_summary.md) and uploaded as well.\nEach file is then shared in Drive so you have accessible web links to both transcript and summary.\n\nLog to Google Sheets\nA Code node collects the email subject, file name, full transcript, formatted summary, and Drive links into one JSON object.\nA Google Sheets node appends a new row with timestamp, subject, summary, transcript, and link so you get a running log of all processed audios.\n\nNotify via Gmail & Slack\nFinally, the workflow:\n\nSends a Gmail message back to the original sender with the meeting summary and links\n\nPosts a Slack notification in your chosen channel, including subject, file name, summary text, and Drive link\n\n**How to set up**\n\nConnect your Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Slack, and OpenAI credentials in the respective nodes.\n\nIn the Gmail Trigger, narrow the scope if needed (e.g. specific label, sender, or inbox).\n\nIn the Drive nodes, set the parent folder where you want the YYYY/MM subfolders to be created.\n\nIn the Google Sheets node, point to your own spreadsheet and sheet name.\n\nIn the Slack node, select the channel where reminders should be posted.\n\nMake sure your OpenAI credentials have access to both audio transcription and chat endpoints.\n\n**Customization ideas**\n\nFilter by sender, subject keyword, or label so only certain emails are processed.\n\nChange the folder structure (e.g. ProjectName/YYYY/MM or YYYY/MM/DD) in the folder-path Code node.\n\nAdjust the transcription prompt (e.g. allow light punctuation clean-up, use another language).\n\nModify the summary format or add extra fields (e.g. meeting participants, project name) in the AI prompt and Markdown template.\n\nSend notifications to other tools: add branches for Notion, LINE, Teams, or additional Slack channels.",
