Here’s how it works:

Schedule Trigger kicks off the workflow daily (or at your preferred interval).

Perplexity AI Node researches the most interesting recent AI news tailored for a non-technical audience.

AI Agent (Claude via Anthropic) turns that news into a full-length blog post based on a structured prompt that includes title, intro, 3+ section headers, takeaway, and meta description—designed for clarity, engagement, and SEO.

Optional Memory & Perplexity Tool Nodes enhance the agent's responses by allowing it to clarify facts or fetch more context.

Google Docs Node automatically saves the final blog post to your selected document—ready for review, scheduling, or publishing.
