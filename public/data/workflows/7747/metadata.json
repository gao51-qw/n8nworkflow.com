  "description": "## Turn LinkedIn Noise Into Weekly Slack Insights 🚀\n\nWhat if your team could skim the *best* of LinkedIn in 2 minutes instead of scrolling for hours?  \nThis workflow transforms raw LinkedIn posts into a **bite-sized Slack digest** — summarized, grouped, and delivered automatically every week.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ What It Does\n- **Scrapes Posts Automatically**: Pulls fresh posts from LinkedIn profiles you specify (via Apify).\n- **Summarizes with AI**: Condenses each post into **2–3 bullets** (≤15 words).\n- **Keeps It Lean**: Digest capped at **500 words total**.\n- **Organized by Author**: See exactly who said what, without searching.\n- **Delivers to Slack**: Neatly formatted digest drops in your channel on schedule, with post links in thread replies.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 How It Works\n1. **Google Sheets → Profile URLs**  \n   Add LinkedIn profile URLs into a Google Sheet tab — this is your watchlist.\n\n2. **Apify Scraper → Posts**  \n   Fetches up to 10 posts per profile within the past 7 days.\n\n3. **Clean & Format**  \n   Code nodes strip out clutter (hashtags, broken links, escapes).\n\n4. **OpenAI Summarizer**  \n   AI rewrites posts into concise bullets and trims the digest under 500 words.\n\n5. **Slack Delivery**  \n   Digest posts directly in Slack every Sunday morning, with original links attached as thread replies.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Pre-conditions / Requirements\n- **Google Sheets API credentials** connected in n8n.  \n- **Apify account + API Token** for the LinkedIn profile posts actor.  \n- **OpenAI API Key** for summarization.  \n- **Slack Bot Token** with permission to post messages in your chosen channel.  \n- Profiles you want to track must be publicly viewable or accessible to Apify.\n\n---\n\n## 🎛 Customization Options\n- **Schedule**: Change the Cron node if you prefer daily or monthly digests.  \n- **Batch Size**: Default is 5 profiles per batch — increase or decrease for performance.  \n- **Summaries**: Adjust OpenAI system prompt to allow longer or shorter bullet points.  \n- **Filters**: Extend `extendOutputFunction` to exclude reposts, sponsored posts, or keep specific authors only.  \n- **Slack Output**: Change formatting, channel, or send as direct message instead of posting in a channel.  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Why This Is Valuable\n- Saves your team **3–5 hours/week** of scrolling.  \n- Keeps everyone updated with **actionable insights, not filler**.  \n- Turns a chaotic LinkedIn feed into a **signal-only digest**.  \n- Positions you as the one who always brings the smartest highlights to the table.  \n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Best For\n- Founders who want LinkedIn insights without endless scrolling.  \n- Marketing and growth teams tracking thought leaders.  \n- Operators who want *signal over noise*, delivered straight to Slack.\n\n---\n\nNo more mindless scrolling. Just sharp insights, automatically packaged. ✅\n",
