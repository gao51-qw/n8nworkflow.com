  "description": "# SaaS Pricing Brief Generator (Decodo → LLM → Google Docs → PDF → Slack)\n## 🚀 Try Decodo — Web Scraping & Data API (Coupon: **TRUNG**)\n![Decodo Logo](https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/automatewith.me/decodo-logo-black.jpg)\n**Decodo** is a powerful public data access platform offering managed web scraping APIs and proxy infrastructure to collect structured web data at scale. It handles proxies, anti-bot protection, JavaScript rendering, retries, and global IP rotation—so you can focus on data, not scraping complexity.\n**Why Decodo**\n- Managed **Web Scraping API** with anti-bot bypass & high success rates  \n- Works with JS-heavy sites; outputs JSON/HTML/CSV  \n- Easy integration (Python, Node.js, cURL) for eCommerce, SERP, social & general web data\n**🎟️ Special Discount**\nUse coupon **`TRUNG`** to get the **Advanced Scraping API** plan — ~**23,000 requests for ~$5**.\n\n## Who this workflow is for\nThis workflow is designed for **Presales, Product Managers, Business Analysts, and Sales teams** who need to:\n- Monitor competitor or SaaS pricing pages\n- Convert unstructured pricing content into a structured, comparable format\n- Quickly generate and share an internal **pricing brief** without manual copy/paste\n\nIt is especially useful during **launches, pricing updates, or quarterly reviews**.\n\n## What this workflow does\nAt a high level, the workflow automates the full pricing intelligence pipeline:\n1. Scrapes a live SaaS pricing page using a real browser environment\n2. Cleans and normalizes the HTML for reliable parsing\n3. Uses an LLM agent to extract pricing plans into structured JSON\n4. Builds an executive-ready SaaS pricing brief\n5. Publishes the brief as a Google Doc and PDF\n6. Shares the final PDF directly to Slack\n\nThe output is a consistent, repeatable pricing brief ready for internal distribution.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Manual Trigger**  \n   The workflow is manually triggered to ensure intentional execution (ideal for known pricing updates).\n\n2. **Configure Target Pricing Page**  \n   Input the competitor pricing URL, device type, and report metadata.\n\n3. **Decodo Pricing Scraper**  \n   Renders the full pricing page using JS and device emulation so tier cards, modals, and dynamic content are captured correctly.\n\n4. **HTML Normalization**  \n   Custom code removes scripts, styles, and noise, leaving clean, readable text for the LLM.\n\n5. **Plan Extraction Agent (LLM)**  \n   The agent translates messy pricing text into a structured JSON schema including:\n   - Plan name\n   - Price and billing period\n   - Key features\n   - CTA / positioning notes\n\n6. **Build SaaS Pricing Brief**  \n   Transforms structured JSON into an executive-ready markdown brief with:\n   - Plan comparison table\n   - Key differentiators\n   - Observations and suggested next actions\n\n7. **Publish Assets**  \n   Creates a Google Doc in a predefined Drive folder and converts it to PDF for sharing.\n\n8. **Share in Slack**  \n   Uploads the PDF directly to a Slack channel (e.g. `#pricing-intel`) for instant visibility.\n\n## Requirements\n- Decodo node configured with a valid plan\n- OpenAI / LLM credentials for the Plan Extraction Agent\n- Google Drive API access\n- Slack workspace and upload permissions\n\n## Notes & best practices\n- Manual trigger avoids unnecessary scraping and rate-limit issues\n- Device emulation ensures accurate pricing capture\n- Structured JSON output enables future extensions (trend tracking, diffing, dashboards)\n- The workflow is modular and easy to adapt for other competitor intelligence use cases",
