## Who this workflow is for
This workflow is designed for **Presales, Product Managers, Business Analysts, and Sales teams** who need to:
- Monitor competitor or SaaS pricing pages
- Convert unstructured pricing content into a structured, comparable format
- Quickly generate and share an internal **pricing brief** without manual copy/paste

It is especially useful during **launches, pricing updates, or quarterly reviews**.

## What this workflow does
At a high level, the workflow automates the full pricing intelligence pipeline:
1. Scrapes a live SaaS pricing page using a real browser environment
2. Cleans and normalizes the HTML for reliable parsing
3. Uses an LLM agent to extract pricing plans into structured JSON
4. Builds an executive-ready SaaS pricing brief
5. Publishes the brief as a Google Doc and PDF
6. Shares the final PDF directly to Slack

The output is a consistent, repeatable pricing brief ready for internal distribution.

## How it works
1. **Manual Trigger**  
   The workflow is manually triggered to ensure intentional execution (ideal for known pricing updates).

2. **Configure Target Pricing Page**  
   Input the competitor pricing URL, device type, and report metadata.

3. **Decodo Pricing Scraper**  
   Renders the full pricing page using JS and device emulation so tier cards, modals, and dynamic content are captured correctly.

4. **HTML Normalization**  
   Custom code removes scripts, styles, and noise, leaving clean, readable text for the LLM.

5. **Plan Extraction Agent (LLM)**  
   The agent translates messy pricing text into a structured JSON schema including:
   - Plan name
   - Price and billing period
   - Key features
   - CTA / positioning notes

6. **Build SaaS Pricing Brief**  
   Transforms structured JSON into an executive-ready markdown brief with:
   - Plan comparison table
   - Key differentiators
   - Observations and suggested next actions

7. **Publish Assets**  
   Creates a Google Doc in a predefined Drive folder and converts it to PDF for sharing.

8. **Share in Slack**  
   Uploads the PDF directly to a Slack channel (e.g. `#pricing-intel`) for instant visibility.

## Requirements
- Decodo node configured with a valid plan
- OpenAI / LLM credentials for the Plan Extraction Agent
- Google Drive API access
- Slack workspace and upload permissions

## Notes & best practices
- Manual trigger avoids unnecessary scraping and rate-limit issues
- Device emulation ensures accurate pricing capture
- Structured JSON output enables future extensions (trend tracking, diffing, dashboards)
- The workflow is modular and easy to adapt for other competitor intelligence use cases
