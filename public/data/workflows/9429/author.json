  "bio": "Over the past 10+ years, I've led marketing initiatives for B2B SaaS companies at every stage, from initial market entry (0→1) through scaled growth (1→10). My approach is grounded in a simple principle: strategic thinking paired with hands-on execution. I focus on building sustainable growth engines, not just campaigns. Whether it's positioning a new product, optimizing conversion funnels, or scaling demand generation, I bring both the framework and the tactical expertise to move fast and win.",
