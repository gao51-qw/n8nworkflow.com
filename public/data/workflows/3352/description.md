## What does this template do ? 

This workflow performs scheduled health checks on a list of URLs stored in a Google Sheet. Every X minutes, it retrieves the URLs, sends HTTP requests to check their availability, and notifies a Telegram chat if any request fails.

You can easily replace Telegram with any other notification service supported by n8n, such as Slack, Discord, Email, or Microsoft Teams.
