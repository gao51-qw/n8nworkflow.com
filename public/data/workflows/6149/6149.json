    "description": "# Learn n8n: Interactive Lesson 1\n\nThis interactive tutorial teaches you how to build in **n8n** from scratch, using a live walkthrough with real-time examples. Rather than static documentation, this guided workflow explains key n8n concepts while you execute each step. It is ideal for developers new to n8n but experienced with programming, JSON, and APIs.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- An active n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n- Basic programming experience (JavaScript or TypeScript, JSON, and APIs)\n- Web browser with console access (for log inspection)\n\n---\n\n## What This Workflow Covers\n\n- Triggers, Form nodes, and data flow\n- How n8n executes nodes one step at a time\n- How data moves between nodes (variables, context, side effects)\n- Merge, Split, Aggregate, and Loop patterns\n- Code nodes in single vs multiple execution modes\n- Debugging using Logs and console output\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n1. **Manual Setup**  \n   Before starting, create your n8n account and optionally enable dark mode. A video link is included with suggested background material.\n\n2. **Form-Based Progression**  \n   The tutorial uses `Form Trigger` and `Form` nodes as interactive checkpoints. You will execute the workflow, follow the browser prompts, and observe what happens in the visual editor.\n\n3. **Live Code and Flow Examples**  \n   Key concepts like branching, merging, and data references are shown in action. Sticky notes in the workflow explain what to look for and how things work.\n\n4. **Execution Behavior**  \n   You will see how multiple items affect execution count, and how to control it using options like Execute Once, batching, and aggregation.\n\n5. **Debugging with Logs**  \n   Toward the end, the workflow encourages you to inspect inputs and outputs of each node, and use `console.log()` inside Code nodes to understand the data being passed around.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use This Workflow\n\nThis workflow is meant to be a long-term reference. If you get stuck building in n8n, return to it.\n\nEach section focuses on a core concept such as how data flows, how execution counts behave, or how to merge parallel branches. You can copy and paste working examples from this tutorial directly into your own workflows to solve common problems.\n\nThis is not just a lesson. It's a toolbox.\n",

Lesson 1\nThis is a follow-along workflow that will teach you how to develop in n8n, from scratch. n8n is a powerful and flexible tool -- but it's quirky, the AI help is often wrong, and the docs are not sufficient or effective.\n\nUsing this workflow you will learn concepts 'live', and can then refer back to these examples as you build your own workflows.\n\nBecause this is a live script, you also will see that its **working with the latest version**, unlike many of the resources you will find on youtube etc. n8n changes very fast, so understandably things that worked even a few months ago may no longer apply to the current version.\n\n### Who is this for?\nYou should have familiarity with:\n- programming (any language)\n- javascript / typescript\n- REST API concepts\n- JSON data\n\n\nIf any of those are not in your wheelhouse, building in n8n will be much more difficult, despite what you are told. \n**Consider that using n8n may be difficult without this knowledge.**\n\n## Ok, Lets Continue Below..."
