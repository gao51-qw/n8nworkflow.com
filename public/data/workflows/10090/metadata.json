  "description": "## Overview\n\nAutomates your complete social media content pipeline: sources articles from Wallabag RSS, generates platform-specific posts with AI, creates contextual images, and publishes via GetLate API. Built with 63 nodes across two workflows to handle LinkedIn, Instagram, and Bluesky—with easy expansion to more platforms.\n\n**Ideal for**: Content marketers, solo creators, agencies, and community managers maintaining a consistent multi-platform presence with minimal manual effort.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Two-Workflow Architecture:**\n\n\n1. **Content Aggregation Workflow**\n   * Monitors Wallabag RSS feeds for tagged articles (#to-share-linkedin, #to-share-instagram, etc.)\n   * Extracts and converts content from HTML to Markdown\n   * Stores structured data in Airtable with platform assignment\n2. **AI Generation & Publishing Workflow**\n   * Scheduled trigger queries Airtable for unpublished content\n   * Routes to platform-specific sub-workflows (LinkedIn, Instagram, Bluesky)\n   * LLM generates optimized post text and image prompts based on custom brand parameters\n   * Optionally generates AI images and hosts them on Imgbb CDN\n   * Publishes via GetLate API (immediate or draft mode)\n   * Updates Airtable with publication status and metadata\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* Tag-based content routing using Wallabag's native system\n* Swappable AI providers (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic)\n* Platform-specific optimization (tone, length, hashtags, CTAs)\n* Modular design—duplicate sub-workflows to add new platforms in \\~30 minutes\n* Centralized Airtable tracking with 17 data points per post\n\n## Set Up Steps\n\n**Setup time**: \\~45-60 minutes for initial configuration\n\n\n1. **Create accounts and get API keys** (\\~15 min)\n   * Wallabag (with RSS feeds enabled)\n   * GetLate (social media publishing)\n   * Airtable (create base with provided schema—see sticky notes)\n   * LLM provider (Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic)\n   * Image service (Hugging Face, [Fal.ai](http://Fal.ai), or Stability AI)\n   * Imgbb (image hosting)\n2. **Configure n8n credentials** (\\~10 min)\n   * Add all API keys in n8n's credential manager\n   * Detailed credential setup instructions in workflow sticky notes\n3. **Set up Airtable database** (\\~10 min)\n   * Create \"RSS Feed - Content Store\" base\n   * Add 19 required fields (schema provided in workflow sticky notes)\n   * Get Airtable base ID and API key\n4. **Customize brand prompts** (\\~15 min)\n   * Edit \"Set Custom SMCG Prompt\" node for each platform\n   * Define brand voice, tone, goals, audience, and image preferences\n   * Platform-specific examples provided in sticky notes\n5. **Configure platform settings** (\\~10 min)\n   * Set GetLate account IDs for each platform\n   * Enable/disable image generation per platform\n   * Choose immediate publish vs. draft mode\n   * Adjust schedule trigger frequency\n6. **Test and deploy**\n   * Tag test articles in Wallabag\n   * Monitor the first few executions in draft mode\n   * Activate workflows when satisfied with the output\n\n**Important**: This is a proof-of-concept template. Test thoroughly with draft mode before production use. Detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting tips, and customization guidance are in the workflow's sticky notes.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n* **63 nodes**: 9 Airtable operations, 8 HTTP requests, 7 code nodes, 3 LangChain LLM chains, 3 RSS triggers, 3 GetLate publishers\n* **Supports**: Multiple LLM providers, multiple image generation services, unlimited platforms via modular architecture\n* **Tracking**: 17 metadata fields per post, including publish status, applied parameters, character counts, hashtags, image URLs\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n* Accounts: Wallabag, GetLate, Airtable, LLM provider, image generation service, Imgbb\n* Basic understanding of n8n workflows and credential configuration\n* Time to customize prompts for your brand voice\n\n*Detailed documentation, Airtable schema, prompt examples, and troubleshooting guides are in the workflow's sticky notes.*\n\n## Category Tags\n\n`#social-media-automation`, `#ai-content-generation`, `#rss-to-social`, `#multi-platform-posting`, `#getlate-api`, `#airtable-database`, `#langchain`, `#workflow-automation`, `#content-marketing`",
