### 💸 GPT-4o Token Tracker – Measure AI Usage and Cost via WhatsApp or Telegram

Hi! I'm Amanda — I create smart, useful AI automations for n8n and Make.  
This workflow helps you monitor how many tokens are consumed per conversation with AI Agent Tokens, and logs that usage into **Google Sheets** — so you can track expenses and make smarter decisions about your AI usage.

You can connect it to **Telegram** or **WhatsApp (via Evolution API)**, and it will automatically capture:
- Prompt and completion tokens
- Total tokens
- Time of interaction
- The user/channel
- (Optional) Cost estimate in USD

---

### 📊 What this workflow does

- Logs token usage from LangChain agents  
- Calculates token totals for each request  
- Appends the data to a structured Google Sheet  
- Works with **WhatsApp (Evolution API)** or **Telegram bots**  
- Ideal for tracking AI Agent Tokens usage over time and controlling costs
