🎵 AI Spotify Playlist Generator (Telegram → Spotify)

instantly create a curated Spotify playlist based on a single song recommendation sent via Telegram. This workflow uses an AI Agent to generate similar tracks, creates a new playlist, sends you the link immediately, and then populates the playlist in the background.
✨ Features

    Instant Feedback: Creates the Spotify playlist and sends the URL back to your Telegram chat immediately, before the AI finishes processing.

    AI Curation: Uses an AI Agent (via OpenRouter) to act as a "Greatest DJ," generating 25 songs similar to your input.

    Smart Searching: Automatically searches Spotify for the generated tracks.

    Error Handling: Includes logic to skip tracks that cannot be found on Spotify.

    Rate Limiting: Includes a wait loop to ensure Spotify API rate limits are respected during population.

🛠️ Prerequisites

To use this workflow, you need:

    n8n: An active instance of n8n.

    Spotify Developer Account: You need a Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate the Spotify node.

    Telegram Bot: A bot token created via @BotFather.

    OpenRouter Account: An API key for OpenRouter to access the LLM (Language Model).

        Note: You can easily swap the OpenRouter node for an OpenAI or Anthropic node if preferred.

🔄 How it Works

    Trigger: You send a message to your Telegram Bot (e.g., "Daft Punk - One More Time").

    Create Playlist: The workflow immediately creates a new empty playlist on your Spotify account named with your username and the prompt.

    Reply: The bot replies to you with the link to the new playlist.

    AI Generation: The prompt is sent to an AI Agent which generates a JSON list of ~25 similar tracks and artists.

    Processing:

        The workflow splits the list into individual items.

        It loops through every item.

        It searches Spotify for the specific Track + Artist.

        If found, it adds the track to the playlist.

        It waits 1 second between adds to prevent API errors.

⚙️ Setup Instructions

    Credentials:

        Set up your Telegram API credentials in the Trigger and Send Message nodes.

        Set up your Spotify OAuth2 credentials in the Create, Search, and Add Item nodes.

        Set up your OpenRouter API credentials in the Chat Model node.

    Model Selection:

        The template is configured to use openai/gpt-5-nano via OpenRouter. If this model is unavailable to you, simply open the OpenRouter Chat Model node and change the model to openai/gpt-4o or meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct.

    Activate:

        Save the workflow and click Activate.

        Open your Telegram bot and send it a song name!
