  "description": "This automated **n8n workflow** continuously tracks real-time flight fare changes by querying airline APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Skyscanner). It compares new prices with historical fares and sends instant notifications to users when a fare drop is detected. All tracked data is structured and logged for audit and analysis.\n\n## **Key Insights**\n\n* Works post-booking to track price fluctuations for booked routes.\n* Supports multiple fare sources for improved accuracy and comparison.\n* Users are notified instantly via **email, SMS**, or **Slack** for high-value drops.\n* Historical pricing data is stored for trend analysis and refund eligibility checks.\n* Can be extended to monitor specific routes or apply airline-specific refund rules.\n\n## **Workflow Process**\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger**\n   Initiates the fare check every 6 hours.\n\n2. **Fetch Flight Fare Data**\n   Queries APIs (Amadeus, Skyscanner) for current flight fares.\n\n3. **Get Tracked Bookings**\n   Retrieves tracked routes from the internal database.\n\n4. **Compare Fares**\n   Detects price drops compared to original booking fares.\n\n5. **Update Fare History Table**\n   Logs the new fare and timestamp into the `fare_tracking` table.\n\n6. **Classify Drops**\n   Determines priority based on absolute and percentage savings.\n\n7. **Notify Users**\n\n   * **Email Alerts**: For all medium/high priority drops.\n   * **SMS Alerts**: For savings &gt; \\$100 or &gt;15%.\n   * **Slack Notifications**: For internal alerts and rebooking suggestions.\n\n8. **Log Activity**\n   Stores all sync actions and notifications in `fare_alert_logs`.\n\n## **Usage Guide**\n\n* **Import** the workflow into your n8n instance.\n* **Set up** API credentials for Amadeus and Skyscanner.\n* Configure **email, SMS (Twilio)**, and **Slack** credentials.\n* Update the booking database with valid records (with route, fare, timestamp).\n* Set schedule frequency (e.g., every 6 hours).\n* Review logs regularly to monitor fare alert activity and system health.\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\n* Valid accounts and credentials for:\n\n  * **Amadeus API**\n  * **Skyscanner API**\n  * **SendGrid (or SMTP)** for email\n  * **Twilio** for SMS\n  * **Slack** workspace & bot token\n* PostgreSQL or MySQL database for fare tracking\n* Tracked booking dataset (with routes, fares, and user contacts)\n\n## **Customization Options**\n\n* Adjust **alert thresholds** in the comparison logic (e.g., trigger only if fare drops &gt; \\$50 or &gt;10%).\n* Add new notification channels (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram).\n* Extend logic to track multi-leg or roundtrip fares.\n* Integrate airline refund APIs (where supported) to auto-initiate refund or credit requests.\n\n## **Excel Output Columns**\n\nWhen exporting or logging fare tracking data to Excel or CSV, use the following structure:\n\n| flight\\_number | airline         | departure                    | arrival                   | departure\\_time           | arrival\\_time             | current\\_fare | route   | timestamp                |\n| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |\n| AT5049         | Royal Air Maroc | John F Kennedy International | Los Angeles International | 2025-07-21T06:00:00+00:00 | 2025-07-21T08:59:00+00:00 | 235           | JFK-LAX | 2025-07-21T13:04:14.000Z |\n| BA1905         | British Airways | John F Kennedy International | Los Angeles International | 2025-07-21T06:00:00+00:00 | 2025-07-21T08:59:00+00:00 | 479           | JFK-LAX | 2025-07-21T13:04:14.000Z |\n",
