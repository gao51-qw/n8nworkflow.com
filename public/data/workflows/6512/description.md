This workflow **automatically removes backgrounds from images** using the APImage API. Simply provide an image URL, and the workflow will process it through **AI-powered background removal**, then download the processed image for use in your projects.

![APImage API Remove Backgrounf from Image with AI n8n workflow template.jpg](fileId:1874)

## Who's it for

This template is perfect for:
* E-commerce businesses needing clean product images
* Content creators who need transparent background images
* Marketing teams processing large batches of images
* Developers building image processing applications
* Anyone who regularly needs background-free images

## How it works

The workflow uses APImage's AI-powered background removal service to automatically detect and remove backgrounds from images. You provide an image URL through a form interface, the API processes the image using advanced AI algorithms, and returns a clean image with the background removed. The processed image is then downloaded and ready for use.

## How to set up

1. **Get your APImage API key:**
   - Sign in to the [APImage Dashboard 🡥](https://apimage.org/dashboard) (or create a new APImage account)
   - Copy your API key from the dashboard

2. **Configure the API connection:**
   - Double-click the **APImage Integration** node
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key (keep the `Bearer` prefix)

3. **Test the workflow:**
   - Click the **Remove Background** form trigger
   - Enter an image URL in the form
   - Submit to process the image

4. **Set up output destination (optional):**
   - Add nodes after the **Download** node to save images to your preferred storage
   - Options include Google Drive, Dropbox, databases, or cloud storage

## Requirements

- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- [APImage 🡥](https://apimage.org) account and valid API key
- Images accessible via public URLs for processing

## How to customize the workflow

**Replace Input Source:**
Swap the Form Trigger with data from other sources like:
- Database queries (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)
- Other APIs or webhooks
- Airtable, Notion, or other productivity tools

**Add Output Destinations:**
Connect additional nodes after the Download step to save processed images to:
- Cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)
- Databases for organized storage
- Content management systems
- Social media platforms
- Email attachments

**Batch Processing:**
Modify the workflow to process multiple images by connecting it to data sources that provide arrays of image URLs.

**Add Image Validation:**
Include nodes to validate image URLs or file formats before processing to avoid API errors.

## Workflow Structure

```
Form Trigger → APImage Integration → Download → [Your Output Destination]
```

The Form Trigger collects image URLs, APImage Integration processes the background removal via API, Download retrieves the processed image, and you can add any output destination for the final images.

## API Details

The workflow sends a POST request to `https://apimage.org/api/ai-remove-background` with:
- **Authorization header:** Your API key
- **image_url:** The URL of the image to process  
- **async:** Set to false for immediate processing

The processed image is returned with a transparent background and downloaded automatically.
