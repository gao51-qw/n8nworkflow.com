# 🧠 AI-Powered Business Prospecting Workflow (Google Maps + Email Enrichment)

### Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for **entrepreneurs, sales teams, marketers, and agencies** who want to **automate lead discovery** and **build qualified business contact lists** — without manual searching or copying data.  
It’s perfect for anyone seeking an **AI-driven prospecting assistant** that saves time, centralizes business data, and stays fully **compliant with GDPR**.

---

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Manually searching for potential clients, copying their details, and qualifying them takes hours — and often leads to messy spreadsheets.  
This workflow **automates the process** by:
- Gathering **publicly available business information** from Google Maps  
- Enriching that data with **AI-powered summaries and contact insights**  
- Compiling it into a clean, ready-to-use **Google Sheet database**

This means you can focus on **closing deals**, not collecting data.

---

### What this workflow does
This automation identifies, analyzes, and organizes business opportunities in just a few steps:
1. **Telegram Trigger** → Send a message specifying your business type, number of leads, and Google Maps URL.  
2. **Apify Integration** → Fetches business information from Google Maps (public data).  
3. **Duplicate Removal** → Ensures clean, non-redundant results.  
4. **AI Summarization (GPT-4)** → Generates concise business summaries for better understanding.  
5. **Email Extraction (GPT-4)** → Finds and extracts professional contact emails from company websites.  
6. **Google Sheets Integration** → Automatically stores results (name, category, location, phone, email, etc.) in a structured sheet.  
7. **Telegram Notification** → Confirms when all businesses are processed.  

All data is handled ethically and transparently — only from **public sources** and without any unsolicited contact.
