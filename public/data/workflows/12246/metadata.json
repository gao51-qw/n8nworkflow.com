  "description": "## How It Works\n***Top Branch Workflow A***\n\n**1. The Market Intelligence:** \n- **Patrols the Market:** Runs hourly to scrape competitor rates for future days.\n- **Gathers Intel:** If prices spike, it instantly checks event announcements to see if a major event is driving demand.\n- **Crunches Numbers:** Calculates the exact price gap and filters out noise.\n\n**2. The Revenue Manager:** \n- **Sets Strategy:** The AI Agent reviews the price gaps, competitor moves, and event signals.\n- **Reports:** Writes a strategic Executive Summary and sends it to your WhatsApp.\n\n\n***Bottom Branch Workflow B***\n\n**3. The Consultant:** \n - **Recall:** When you ask a question via WhatsApp, the bot retrieves the saved analysis, historical rates, and event schedule.\n  - **Answer:** It acts as an on-demand analyst, conducting further analysis to give an informed answer to questions\n\n\n## Setup Steps\n**1. Config:** Add your hotel + competitor hotels (IDs/names) in the Config node.\n\n**2. Monitor Window:** Set how far ahead you want to monitor (e.g., daysAhead = 30) in the Config node.\n\n**3. Sensitivity:** Set how sensitive alerts should be (e.g., alert only if competitor moves &gt; 10%) in the Significant Competitor Change node.\n\n**4. Connect Credentials:**\n\n- Amadeus (to fetch hotel prices)\n- WhatsApp (to send alerts)\n- Postgres/SQL (to store price snapshots, history, summary)\n- OpenAI (for the AI Agents)\n\n**5. Event Source:** Update the Fetch VCC nodes to scrape your local convention center or event site.\n\n**6. Run a test:**\n\nTrigger Workflow A manually and confirm you receive a WhatsApp alert.\n\nReply to that WhatsApp message to test Workflow B (Q&A).\n\n## Use Cases & Benefits\n**For Revenue Managers:** Automate the \"rate shop\" routine and catch competitor moves without opening a spreadsheet.\n\n**For Sales & Marketing Teams:** Go beyond raw data. Pairing \"what changed\" with \"why changed\" instantly.\n\n**For Hotel Leadership:** Perfect for GMs and division leaders who need instant, decision-ready alerts via WhatsApp.\n\n⚡ ***Zero-Touch Efficiency:*** Eliminates hours of manual searching by automating rate checks 3x daily. \n🧠 ***Contextual Intelligence:*** Tracks price AND explains why it moved by cross-referencing local events. \n🤖 ***Actionable Strategy:*** AI doesn't just report numbers; it recommends specific pricing tactics. \n📉 ***Long-Term Vision:*** Builds a permanent database of rate history, enabling the AI to answer complex trend questions over time.\n\n## 📬 Want to Customize This?\n[leelin.business@gmail.com](leelin.business@gmail.com)",
