## Try It Out!

This n8n template helps you create SEO-optimized Blog Posts for your businesses website or for personal use.

Whether you're managing a business or helping local restaurants improve their digital presence, this workflow helps you build SEO-Optimized Blog Posts in seconds using Google Autocomplete and People Also Ask (SerpAPI). 

Who Is It For? 
- This is helpful for people looking to SEO Optimize either another person's website or their own. 

How It Works?
- You start with a list of blog inspirations in Google Sheets (e.g., “Best Photo Session Spots”).
- The workflow only processes rows where the “Status” column is not marked as “done”, though you can remove this condition if you’d like to process all rows each time. 
- The workflow pulls Google Autocomplete suggestions and PAA questions using: A custom-built SEO API I deployed via Render (for Google Autocomplete + PAA), SerpAPI (for additional PAA data). 
- These search insights are merged. For example, if your blog idea is “Photo Session Spots,” the workflow gathers related Google search phrases and questions users are asking.
- Then, GPT-4 is used to draft a full blog post based on this data.
- The finished post is saved back into your Google Sheet.

How To Use
- Fill out the “Blog Inspiration” column in your Google Sheet with the topics you want to write about.
- Update the OpenAI prompt in the ChatGPT node to match your tone or writing style. (Tip: Add a system prompt with context about your business or audience.)
- You can trigger this manually, or replace it with a cron schedule, webhook, or other event.

Requirements
- A SerpAPI account to get PAA
- An OpenAI account for ChatGPT
- Access to Google Sheets and n8n

How To Set-Up? 
- Your Google Sheet should have three columns: "Blog Inspiration", "Status" → set this to “done” when a post has been generated, "Blog Draft" → this is automatically filled by the workflow. 

- To use the SerpAPI HTTP Request node: 1. Drag in an HTTP Request node, 2. Set the Method and URL depending on how you're using SerpAPI: Use POST to run the actor live on each request. Use GET to fetch from a static dataset (cheaper if reusing the same data). 3. Add query parameters for your SerpAPI key and input values. 4. Test the node.

- The “Autocomplete” node connects to a custom web service I built and deployed using Render. I wrote a Python script (hosted on GitHub) that pulls live Google Autocomplete suggestions and PAA questions based on any topic you send. This script was turned into an API and deployed as a public web service via Render. Anyone can use it by sending a POST request to: https://seo-api2.onrender.com/get-seo-data (the URL is already in the node). Since this is hosted on Render’s free tier, if the service hasn’t been used in the past ~15 minutes, it may “go to sleep.” When that happens, the first request can take 10–30 seconds to respond while it wakes up.


Happy Automating!
