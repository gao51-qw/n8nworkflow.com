## How It Works

**Automatic Processing Pipeline:**
* **Form Submission Trigger**: Workflow initiates when a user submits a document through a web form
* **Document Upload**: PDF files are automatically uploaded to LlamaIndex Cloud for processing  
* **Smart Status Monitoring**: The system continuously checks processing status and adapts the workflow based on results
* **Conditional Content Extraction**: Upon successful processing, extracted Markdown content is retrieved for further use
