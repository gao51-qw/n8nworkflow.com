**Feel like your inbox is a junk drawer you’re scared to open?** 📧

Meet the Sunday Sweep Gmail Zero workflow—the soft-tech hug your Gmail has been waiting for. 🕊️

**What it does (in plain English)**

• Every Sunday at 9 PM it quietly hunts down newsletters older than 30 days and gently archives them—no scary deletions, just a neat sweep.

• Fresh receipts, invoices or order confirmations from the past 24 hours are instantly labeled 🧾 “Receipts” so you can find them at tax time without digging.

• You wake up Monday to a crystal-clear inbox, zero overwhelm, and one big check-mark off your to-do list. ✅

**Who it’s perfect for:**

✨ Etsy shop owners, virtual assistants, wellness coaches, and any homemaker-preneur who wants automation that feels like a friend, not a robot takeover. No coding skills, no jargon—just plug in your Gmail account and let the calm routine run on autopilot.

**Bonus goodies**
