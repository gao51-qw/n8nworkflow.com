# How it works

It’s very important to come prepared to Sales calls. This often means a lot of manual research about the person you’re calling with. This workflow delivers a summary of the latest social media activity (LinkedIn + X) for businesses you are about to interact with each day.

- **Scans Your Calendar**: Each morning, it reviews your Google Calendar for any scheduled meetings or calls with companies based on each attendee email address.
- **Fetches Latest Posts**: For each identified company, it fetches recent LinkedIn and X posts and summerizes them using AI to deliver a qucik overview for a busy sales rep.
- **Delivers Insights**: You receive personalized emails via Gmail, each dedicated to a company you’re meeting with that day, containing a reminder of the meeting and a summary of company's recent social media activity.
