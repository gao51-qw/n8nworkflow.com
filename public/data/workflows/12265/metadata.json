  "description": "Turn any topic into a ready-to-study Anki deck. This workflow generates vocabulary flashcards with AI images and native pronunciation, then sends the .apkg file straight to your inbox.\n\n**What it does**\n1. You fill out a simple form (topic, languages, difficulty)\n2. GPT-4 creates vocabulary with translations, readings, and example sentences\n3. DALL-E 3 generates a unique image for each word\n4. ElevenLabs adds native pronunciation audio (word + example)\n5. Everything gets packaged into a real .apkg file\n6. The deck lands in your email, ready to import into Anki\n7. A backup copy saves to Google Sheets\n\n**Why I built this**\nI was spending hours making flashcards by hand for language learning. Finding images, recording audio, formatting everything for Anki... it took forever. This workflow does all of that in about 3 minutes.\n\n**Setup (~15 min)**\n1. Install npm packages: `jszip` and `sql.js`\n2. Add OpenAI credentials (for GPT-4 + DALL-E)\n3. Add ElevenLabs credentials\n4. Connect Gmail and Google Sheets via OAuth\n5. Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the DALL-E code node\n6. Update the Spreadsheet ID in the Sheets node\n\n**Features**\n- 20 languages supported\n- 7 image styles (minimal icons, kawaii, realistic, watercolor, pixel art...)\n- 6 difficulty levels (A1 to C2)\n- Optional reverse cards (target→native AND native→target)\n- Works on Anki desktop and mobile",
