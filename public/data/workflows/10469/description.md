Transform your Google Form into an intelligent customer support system that automatically analyzes, prioritizes, and responds to every inquiry with AI-powered personalization.

## How it works

When someone submits your Google Form, this workflow:

- **Generates personalized reply** using OpenAI, tailored to urgency and sentiment
- **Sends auto-reply** via Gmail with professional formatting
- **Alerts your team** on Slack for high-priority cases requiring human follow-up
- **Logs everything** to tracking sheet for analytics and audit trail

## How to customize

**Adjust triage criteria:**

Edit the "Analyze with AI Triage" prompt to define what qualifies as high/medium/low urgency for your business. Add custom categories beyond the default five (technical/sales/support/billing/general).

**Modify response templates:**

Customize the three response generation nodes to match your brand voice. Add company-specific information, policies, or FAQ links. Adjust tone from formal to casual based on your audience.

**Add advanced features:**

- Insert CRM integration to check customer history before responding
- Add condition nodes to route specific categories to different team members
- Include file attachments (brochures, manuals) based on inquiry type
- Implement follow-up sequences with Wait nodes
- Connect multiple notification channels (Discord, email, SMS)

The AI automatically detects and responds in the inquiry's language. Customize prompts with language-specific instructions if needed.
