  "description": "This workflow generates a tailored cover letter using a provided resume and job description.\n\nUsers submit a job description via form (or workflow input), the workflow uses an LLM to write a professional, casual cover letter, then creates and populates a Google Doc and redirects the user to download or review it.\n\n---\n\n## What You Must Update Before Running\n\n### 1. Resume Content\nUpdate the **Configuration** node to include your own resume text.  \nThis resume is injected directly into the prompt and used as the sole source of experience and qualifications.\n\n### 2. LLM Credentials\nThe workflow uses **OpenRouter** with an OpenAI-compatible model.\n\nYou must:\n- Add your own OpenRouter API credentials\n- Optionally change the model selection if desired\n\n### 3. Google Docs Credentials\nThis workflow creates and edits Google Docs.\n\nYou must:\n- Connect your own Google Docs OAuth credentials\n- Update the destination folder ID if you want files saved elsewhere\n\n---\n\n## What You Can Configure\n\n### 1. Prompt Tone & Constraints\nEdit the **Write Cover Letter** agent system prompt to adjust:\n- Tone (more formal or more casual)\n- Length\n- Writing style constraints\n\n### 2.
