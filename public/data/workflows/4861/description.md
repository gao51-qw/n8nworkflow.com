### Who this is for?

Google SERP Tracker + Trends and Recommendations is an AI-powered n8n workflow that extracts Google search results via Bright Data, parses them into structured JSON using Google Gemini, and generates actionable recommendations and search trends. It outputs CSV reports and sends real-time Webhook notifications.

This workflow is ideal for:

- SEO Agencies needing automated rank & trend tracking

- Growth Marketers seeking daily/weekly search-based insights

- Product Teams monitoring brand or competitor visibility

- Market Researchers performing search behavior analysis

- No-code Builders automating search intelligence workflows

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Traditional tracking of search engine rankings and search trends is often fragmented and manual. Analyzing SERP changes and trends requires:

- Manual extraction or using unstable scrapers

- Unstructured or cluttered HTML data

- Lack of actionable insights or recommendations

This workflow solves the problem by:

- Automating real-time Google SERP data extraction using Bright Data

- Structuring unstructured search data using Google Gemini LLM

- Generating actionable recommendations and trends

- Exporting both CSV reports automatically to disk for downstream use

- Notifying external systems via Webhook

### What this workflow does

- Accepts search input, zone name, and webhook notification URL

- Uses Bright Data to extract Google Search Results

- Uses Google Gemini LLM to parse the SERP data into structured JSON

- Loops over structured results to:

- Extract recommendations

- Extract trends

- Saves both as .csv files (example below):

	- Google_SERP_Recommendations_Response_2025-06-10T23-01-50-650Z.csv

	- Google_SERP_Trends_Response_2025-06-10T23-01-38-915Z.csv

- Sends a Webhook with the summary or file reference

**LLM Usage**
