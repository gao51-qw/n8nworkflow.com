## Description
This workflow is designed to evaluate newly added CVs for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) eligibility. It automatically ingests CVs from Google Drive, extracts key fields, analyzes them with Azure OpenAI, logs structured DEI outcomes in Google Sheets, and sends a concise DEI-focused summary email to the hiring manager. The entire flow prioritizes consistent, auditable DEI checks and controlled logic paths.

## What This Template Does
- Watches Google Drive for new CV files to trigger DEI evaluation.
- Downloads and extracts text/structured fields from PDF CVs.
- Assesses DEI eligibility using Azure OpenAI, following defined criteria and prompts.
- Appends DEI results (eligible/not eligible, rationale, confidence) to Google Sheets for tracking.
- Generates and sends a DEI-focused summary email to the hiring manager for review.

## Key Benefits
- Standardized DEI screening to support equitable hiring decisions.
- Centralized, structured logging in Sheets for transparency and audits.
- Automated DEI summaries for faster, consistent manager review.
- Reliable routing with true/false logic to enforce DEI evaluation steps.

## Features
- Google Drive trigger (fileCreated) for CV intake tied to DEI checks.
- PDF extraction mapped to fields relevant for DEI evaluation.
- Azure OpenAI Chat Model prompts tuned for DEI criteria and rationale.
- Google Sheets append with eligibility status, notes, and timestamps.
- Email node that delivers DEI summaries and next-step guidance.
- Logic branching (true/false) to control DEI evaluation and notifications.

## Requirements
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).
- Google Drive access to the CV intake folder.
- Google Sheets access for DEI results logging.
- Azure OpenAI access and configured prompts reflecting DEI criteria.
- Email node credentials to send DEI summaries to managers.

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

## DEI-Focused Best Practices
- Clarify DEI criteria and document them in your prompt and sheet schema.
- Avoid including sensitive PII in emails; store only necessary fields for DEI decisions.

- Maintain an audit trail (timestamps, model version, prompt version, decision rationale).
- Periodically review prompts and sheet schema to align with policy updates.
