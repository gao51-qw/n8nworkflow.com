## What this workflow does
This workflow automatically **downloads files from an FTP folder** and **uploads them to Google Drive**.  
It’s useful for backup, reporting, or syncing data between systems.

## How it works
1. **Cron Trigger** runs on a schedule (default: every hour).  
2. **FTP List node** checks the specified folder on your FTP server.  
3. **FTP Download node** fetches each file found.  
4. **Google Drive Upload node** saves the file into your chosen Google Drive folder.

## Pre-conditions / Requirements
- An active FTP server with accessible login credentials.  
- A Google account with access to the Drive folder you want to sync into.  
- Make sure the target Google Drive folder exists, and copy its Folder ID.  
- Ensure files in your FTP folder have unique names if you want to avoid overwriting in Google Drive.


## Setup
- **FTP:** Add your FTP credentials and replace `{{FTP_FOLDER}}` with the path of the folder you want to sync.  
- **Google Drive:** Connect your Google Drive account and replace `{{GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID}}` with the folder ID where files should be stored.  
- Adjust the Cron schedule (e.g. daily, weekly) depending on how often you need the sync.

## Customization Options
- **File filtering:** Add an *IF node* after the FTP List node to only download files matching certain extensions (e.g., `.csv`, `.pdf`).  
- **File renaming:** Use a *Set node* to rename files before uploading to Google Drive (helpful for timestamping or avoiding duplicates).  
- **Archiving:** Add a second Google Drive or FTP Upload node to store processed files in an archive folder.  
- **Error handling:** Connect an *Error Trigger* to notify you via Slack or email if a file transfer fails.
