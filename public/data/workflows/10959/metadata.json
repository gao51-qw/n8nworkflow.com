  "description": "## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors **eBay Deals** and sends **Telegram alerts** when relevant, high-quality deals are detected.\n\nIt combines:\n- **Web scraping with Decodo**\n- **JavaScript pre-processing (no raw HTML sent to the LLM)**\n- **AI-based product classification and deal scoring**\n- **Rule-based filtering using price and score**\n\nOnly valuable deals reach the final notification.\n\n## How it works (overview)\n\n1. The workflow runs manually or on a schedule.\n2. The eBay Deals page is scraped using **Decodo**, which handles proxies and anti-bot protections.  \n[Decodo – Web Scraper for n8n](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD)\n3. JavaScript extracts only key product data (ID, title, price, URL, image).\n4. An AI Agent classifies each product and assigns a deal quality score (0–10).\n5. Price and score rules are applied.\n6. Matching deals are sent to Telegram.\n\n\n## How to configure it\n\n### 1. Decodo\n- Add your **Decodo API credentials** to the Decodo node.\n- Optionally change the target eBay URL.\n\n### 2. AI Agent\n- Add your LLM credentials (e.g. Google Gemini).\n- No HTML is sent to the model — only compact, structured data.\n\n### 3. Telegram\n- Add your **Telegram Bot Token**.\n- Set your **chat_id** in the Telegram node.\n- Customize the alert message if needed.\n\n### 4. Filtering rules\n- Adjust price limits and minimum deal score in the **IF node**",
