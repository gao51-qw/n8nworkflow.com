This workflow acts as an automated engagement bot. It sends a Direct Message (DM) with a link or resource to any follower who replies to your post with a specific target keyword.

## Who is this for
Ideal for creators and community managers who want to distribute resources (PDFs, links, invites) to their audience automatically without manually messaging each person.

## What it does
It scans your notifications for new replies and applies a strict filter to ensure only the right people get messaged:
* **Targeted:** It only monitors replies on the specific post you choose.
* **Keyword Match:** Checks if the user's reply contains your specific trigger word (e.g., "Send").
* **Follower Check:** Verifies if the user is following you (if not, it skips them).
* **Delivery:** Opens a chat conversation and sends your pre-set message.
* **Engagement:** Automatically "Likes" the user's reply to confirm receipt.
* **Anti-Spam:** Remembers processed replies so it never messages the same user twice for the same interaction.

## How to set up
1. **Configuration:** Open the first node ("Configuration") and enter:
   * **BlueSky Credentials:** Your Handle and App Password.
   * **Target Post URL:** The full link to the specific BlueSky post you want to monitor.
   * **Trigger Keyword:** The word users must type (e.g., "Template").
   * **DM Message:** The actual text/link to send them.
2. **Activate:** Turn the workflow on. It runs every 30 minutes to batch-process new replies.
