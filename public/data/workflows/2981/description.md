# ✍️🌄 WordPress + AI Content Creator

This workflow automates the creation and publishing of multi-reading-level content for WordPress blogs. It leverages AI to generate optimized articles, automatically creates featured images, and provides versions of the content at different reading levels (Grade 2, 5, and 9).

## How It Works

### Content Generation & Processing 🎯
- Starts with a manual trigger and a user-defined blog topic
- Uses AI to create a structured blog post with proper HTML formatting
- Separates and validates the title and content components
- Saves a draft version to Google Drive for backup

### Multi-Reading Level Versions 📚
Automatically rewrites the content for different reading levels:
- Grade 9: Sophisticated language with appropriate metaphors
- Grade 5: Simplified with light humor and age-appropriate examples
- Grade 2: Basic language with simple metaphors and child-friendly explanations

### WordPress Integration 🌐
