## Who is this for
This workflow is designed for marketers, researchers, and business owners who need to quickly find and export company data from Google Maps into a structured table format.

## What problem is this workflow solving
Manually collecting business contact information from Google Maps is time-consuming and error-prone.

For example, title, rating, reviews, address, operating hours, phone, website, type, gps coordinates.
