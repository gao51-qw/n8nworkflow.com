  "description": "## Create Products in Shopify from a Google Sheet\n\nThis workflow creates products in your Shopify store from a google sheet. It also enables inventory tracking and sets the quantity of an inventory item at your store's default location. \n\nThis is a great way to get test data into test or staging stores to try out apps, update templates or try out new designs. \n\nThis Automation will only import new products. It will skip existing products if the slug matches an existing product's handle (Shopify's term for a slug).\n \n### Setup Notes\n\nThe Google Sheet has the following columns :\ntitle - free text\ndescription - free text\ncompany - free text\ncategory - free text\nstatus - ACTIVE, DRAFT or ARCHIVE\nslug - used in the product url, text with no spaces, can also use hyphen.\nprice - sale price of the products\ncompare_at_price - compare at price for products\nsku - unique code for each product\nstock_on_hand - quantity of this item available for purchase.\n\nUse those labels in the first row of your sheet and N8N will create one object per row with the column names as object fields. \n\n### Update GraphQL nodes with your Shopify store URL\n\n1) Replace the URL in all GraphQL nodes with the URL for your Shopify store. \n2) These GraphQL requests all use the Shopify 2025-04 GraphQL Admin API. \n\n\nThis flow is updated to use Airtable at [Sync Products between Airtable and Shopify with Inventory Management](https://n8n.io/workflows/7468-sync-products-between-airtable-and-shopify-with-inventory-management/)",
