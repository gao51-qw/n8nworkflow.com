## This n8n template implements an AI-Powered Chatbot for Automated WHMCS Support Ticket Creation

## Who's it for

This template is designed for **web hosting companies, domain registrars, and IT service providers** who want to automate their customer support ticket creation process. It's perfect for businesses looking to streamline support operations by automatically converting customer chat conversations into structured WHMCS support tickets while maintaining professional, empathetic customer interactions.

## How it works / What it does

This workflow creates an **AI-powered chatbot** that automatically converts customer chat messages into structured support tickets within the WHMCS system. The AI agent automatically:

1. **Receives customer queries** through a webhook endpoint
2. **Processes natural language requests** using Google Gemini AI
3. **Extracts key information** from customer conversations:
   - Customer name and email
   - Issue description and subject
   - Appropriate support department
   - Priority level (Low, Medium, High)
4. **Fetches valid support departments** from WHMCS using the GetSupportDepartments API
5. **Creates structured support tickets** via WHMCS OpenTicket API
6. **Maintains conversation context** with session-based memory
7. **Provides professional responses** while gathering necessary information

The system ensures **100% accuracy** by always mapping to valid WHMCS departments and never inventing ticket fields, maintaining data integrity and proper ticket routing.
