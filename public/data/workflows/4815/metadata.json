  "description": "### This n8n template demonstrates how to build a simple but effective vintage image restoration service using an AI model with image editing capabilities.\n\nWith Gemini now capable of multimodal output, it's a great time to explore this capability for image or graphics automation. Let's see how well it does for a task such as image restoration.\n\n**Good to know**\n* At time of writing, each image generated will cost $0.039 USD. See Gemini Pricing for updated info.\n* The model used in this workflow is geo-restricted! If it says model not found, it may not be available in your country or region.\n\n### How it works\n* Images are imported into our workflow via the HTTP node and converted to base64 strings using the Extract from file node.\n* The image data is then pipelined to Gemini's Image Generation model. A prompt is provided to instruct Gemini to \"restore\" the image to near new condition - of course, feel free to experiment with this prompt to improve the results!\n* Gemini's responds with the image as a base64 string and hence, a convert to file node is used to transform the data to binary.\n* With the restored image as a binary, we can then use this with our Google Drive node to upload it to our desired folder.\n\n### How to use\n* This demonstration uses 3 random images sourced from the internet but any typical image file will work.\n* Use a webhook node to allow integration from other applications.\n* Use a telegram trigger for instant mobile service!\n\n### Requirements\n* Google Gemini for LLM/Image generation\n* Google Drive for Upload Storage\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* AI image editing can be applied to many use-cases not just image restoration. Try using it to add watermarks, branding or modify an existing image for marketing purposes.",
