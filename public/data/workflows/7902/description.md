**Good to know**

At time of writing, each Gemini request is billed per token. See [Gemini Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for updated details.
The workflow uses Gmail labels (e.g., *youtube-viewers*, *sales-inquiry*, *meeting-request*, *potential-clients*, *collaboration-requests*) for classification — make sure these exist in your Gmail account.

**How it works**

* **Chat Trigger**: You interact with the agent via a chat interface (webhook).
* **AI Agent**: Gemini-powered assistant interprets your instructions (send, reply, label, delete, fetch emails).
* **Email Actions**: Based on your request, the assistant uses Gmail tools to act on emails (Send, Reply, Label, Delete, Get Many).
* **Contact Lookup**: If only a name is provided, the agent checks Google Sheets for the matching email address. If not found, it prompts you to add it.
* **Memory**: A buffer memory stores chat context so the assistant can maintain continuity across multiple interactions.
* **Labeling**: Emails can be auto-labeled for better organization (e.g., client inquiries, meeting requests).

**How to use**

* Send commands like:
  *“Reply to John’s email with a follow-up about the project.”*
  *“Label Sarah’s email as potential-client.”*
  *“Delete the latest spam email.”*
* The Gmail Agent will handle the request instantly and keep everything logged properly.
