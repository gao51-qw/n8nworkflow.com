Stop wasting time on video editing! This template is designed for **content creators and marketers** who need a fast, scalable way to convert simple text scripts into polished, shareable AI-generated videos and publish them automatically to Instagram. The workflow includes a critical human review step to maintain quality control.

### **Prerequisites**

To use this template, you must have the following:

* An active n8n instance.
* An **active Blotato account** (required for the AI video generation and Instagram upload API access).
* The **Blotato n8n node** must be installed on your n8n instance.
* A configured **Gmail** node to handle the human approval step.

### **How It Works (Workflow Breakdown)**

This automation efficiently moves your content from a text script to a live Instagram post:

1.  **Script Input (`Form` Node):**
    * The workflow starts by accepting your script via a simple form input.
2.  **Data Structuring (`Information Extractor` Node):**
    * The raw script is processed to arrange the information into a specific JSON schema, ensuring the **Blotato Create Content** node receives the correct input format required for AI video generation.
3.  **AI Video Generation (`Blotato` Node):**
    * The process triggers the **Blotato AI video generation**. This process is set to run in a *Queue* mode.
4.  **Status Check Loop (`Loop`, `Wait`, `IF` Nodes):**
    * Since video generation takes time, the workflow enters a loop:
        * It uses a **Wait** node to pause for 80 seconds.
        * It then uses the **Blotato Get Video** node, combined with an **IF** node, to check the generation status.
        * This loop continues until the video is fully generated.
5.  **Human Approval (`Gmail` Node):**
    * Once the video is generated, the hosted video link is sent to your Gmail. The email includes two interactive buttons: "Approve" and "Disapprove."
6.  **Instagram Upload (`Blotato` Node):**
    * If you choose to "Approve" the video, the final step uses the **Blotato** node to automatically upload the finished video as an Instagram Reel.
