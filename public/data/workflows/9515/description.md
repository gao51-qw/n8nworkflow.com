This workflow streamlines your lead management process by automatically capturing form submissions from **Jotform**, updating **Attio CRM**, and notifying your **team (sales team for example) via Slack** — all without manual work.

## How it works
1. **Receive Lead:**
- A new submission is captured from Jotform (name, email, message).

2. **Prepare CRM:**
- Checks if the `Pending` and `Urgent` deal stages exist in Attio CRM and creates them if they don’t exist.
- Checks if the `Message` column exists in Attio CRM and creates it if it doesn't exist.

3. **Lead Handling:**
- If the lead **doesn't exist** in Attio CRM, the contact is created, a new deal is added to the `Pending` stage, and a Slack notification is sent.
- If the lead **exists but has no deal**, a new deal is added to `Pending`, and Slack is notified.
- If the **lead exists with a deal**, the deal is moved to the `Urgent` stage, and Slack is notified.

4. **Slack Notification:**
- Your team (sales team for example) receives an instant Slack message whenever a new or existing lead is processed, so they can act fast.
