### **Secret Santa (Amigo Invisible) Automation 🎁**

This workflow fully automates a **Secret Santa** (Amic Invisible) event — perfect for friends, families, or office teams who want to make their gift exchange fun, fair, and completely private.

It takes a simple list of participant names and emails, then automatically pairs everyone using a **non-repeating random assignment system (derangement algorithm)** — meaning no one is ever assigned to themselves and every participant both gives and receives a gift exactly once.

Once the pairs are generated, the workflow sends each participant a beautifully formatted email revealing only their assigned recipient. After each email is sent, it is **automatically deleted from the “Sent” folder** to ensure the organizer cannot see or trace who got whom, keeping the surprise intact.

At the end of the process, the workflow generates a **numerical summary** like “1 sent to 2, 2 sent to 3…” — allowing the organizer to verify that everything worked correctly **without revealing the actual names or emails** of the participants.

This automation combines creativity, privacy, and transparency — making it perfect for anyone who wants to manage a Secret Santa game with ease, fairness, and a touch of automation magic.
