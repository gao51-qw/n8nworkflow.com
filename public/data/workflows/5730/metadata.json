  "description": " ## How It Works – Data Deduplication in n8n\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to remove duplicate records from a dataset using JavaScript logic inside n8n's Code nodes. It simulates real-world data cleaning by generating sample user data with intentional duplicates (based on email addresses) and walks you through the process of deduplication step-by-step.\n\n**The process includes**:\n\nCreating Sample Data with duplicates.\nFiltering Out Duplicates using filter() and findIndex() based on email.\nDisplaying Cleaned Results with simple statistics for before-and-after comparison.\nThis is ideal for scenarios like CRM imports, ETL processes, and general data hygiene.\n\n## ⚙️ Set-Up Steps\n\n🔹 Step 1: Manual Trigger\nNode: When clicking 'Test workflow'\nPurpose: Initiates the workflow manually for testing.\n\n🔹 Step 2: Generate Sample Data\nNode: Create Sample Data (Code node)\nWhat it does:\n\nCreates 6 users, including 2 intentional duplicates (by email).\nOutputs data as usersJson with metadata (totalCount, message).\nMimics real-world messy datasets.\n🔹 Step 3: Deduplicate the Data\nNode: Deduplicate Users (Code node)\nWhat it does:\n\nParses usersJson.\nUses .filter() + .findIndex() to keep only the first instance of each email.\nLogs total, unique, and removed counts.\nOutputs clean user list as separate items.\n🔹 Step 4: Display Results\nNode: Display Results (Code node)\nWhat it does:\n\n**Outputs structured summary**:\nUnique users\nStatus\nTimestamp\nPrepares results for review or downstream use.\n📈 Sample Output\n\nOriginal count: 6 users\nDeduplicated count: 4 users\nDuplicates removed: 2 users\n🎯 Learning Objectives\n\n**You'll learn how to**:\n\nUse .filter() and .findIndex() in n8n Code nodes\nClean JSON data within workflows\nCreate simple, effective deduplication pipelines\nOutput structured summaries for reporting or integration\n🧠**Best Practices**\n\nValidate input format (e.g., JSON schema)\nHandle null or missing fields gracefully\nUse logging for visibility\nAdd error handling for production use\nUse pagination/chunking for large datasets",
