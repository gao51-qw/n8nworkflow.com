  "description": "**How it works**\n\nStart every morning on a positive note! This workflow automates delivering a curated summary of positive news directly to your mailbox. It automatically:\n\n- Fetches the latest articles from a dedicated \"good news\" source (like Good News Network) every morning.\n\n- Uses Artificial Intelligence to summarize each positive article concisely.\n\n- Compiles these summaries into a clear and uplifting daily digest.\n\n- Sends the daily digest to your specified email address.\n\nSay goodbye to doomscrolling and hello to your dose of daily inspiration!\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nSetting up this workflow is straightforward, typically taking around 10-15 minutes. You'll need to:\n\n- Authenticate your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail).\n\n- Obtain an API key for your chosen AI service (e.g., OpenAI).\n\nAll detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.",
