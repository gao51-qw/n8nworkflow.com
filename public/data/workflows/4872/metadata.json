  "description": "![image.png](fileId:1497)\n\n📝 **Overview**\nThis workflow transforms n8n into a smart real-estate concierge by combining an AI chat interface with [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/ar8wlq0xkpv5)’s marketplace datasets. Users interact via chat to specify city, price, bedrooms, and bathrooms—and receive a curated list of three homes for sale, complete with images and briefings.\n\n🎥 **Workflow in Action**\nWant to see this workflow in action? Play the [video](https://public.n8nhackers.com/videos/real-estate-agent.webm)\n\n\n🔑 **Key Features**\n\n* **AI-Powered Chat Trigger:** Instantly start conversations using LangChain’s Chat Trigger node.\n* **Contextual Memory:** Retain up to 30 recent messages for coherent back-and-forth.\n* **Bright Data Integration:** Dynamically filter “FOR\\_SALE” properties by city, price, bedrooms, and bathrooms (limit = 3).\n* **Automated Snapshot Retrieval:** Poll for dataset readiness and fetch full snapshot content.\n* **HTML-Formatted Output:** Present results as a `<ul>` of `<li>` items, embedding property images.\n\n🚀 **How It Works (Step-by-Step)**\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n\n   * n8n ≥ v1.0\n   * Community nodes: install `n8n-nodes-brightdata` (the unverified community node)\n   * API credentials: OpenAI, Bright Data\n   * Webhook endpoint to receive chat messages\n\n2. **Node Configuration:**\n\n   * **Chat Trigger:** Listens for incoming chat messages; shows a welcome screen.\n   * **Memory Buffer:** Stores the last 30 messages for context.\n   * **OpenAI Chat Model:** Uses GPT-4o-mini to interpret user intent.\n   * **Real Estate AI Agent:** Orchestrates filtering logic, calls tools, and formats responses.\n   * **Bright Data “Filter Dataset” Tool:** Applies user-defined filters plus `homeStatus = FOR_SALE`.\n   * **Wait & Recover Snapshot:** Polls until snapshot is ready, then fetches content.\n   * **Get Snapshot Content:** Converts raw JSON into a structured list.\n\n3. **Workflow Logic:**\n\n   * User sends search criteria → Agent validates inputs.\n   * Agent invokes “Filter Dataset” once all filters are present.\n   * Upon dataset readiness, the snapshot is retrieved and parsed.\n   * Final output rendered as a bullet list with property images.\n\n4. **Testing & Optimization:**\n\n   * Use the built-in **Execute Workflow** trigger for rapid dry runs.\n   * Inspect node outputs in n8n’s UI; adjust filter defaults or snapshot limits.\n   * Tune OpenAI model parameters (e.g., `maxIterations`) for faster responses.\n\n5. **Deployment & Monitoring:**\n\n   * Activate the main workflow and expose its webhook URL.\n   * Monitor executions in the “Executions” panel; set up alerts for errors.\n   * Archive or duplicate workflows as needed; update credentials via credential manager.\n\n✅ **Pre-requisites**\n\n* **Bright Data Account:** API key for marketplaceDataset.\n* **OpenAI Account:** Access to GPT-4o-mini model.\n* **n8n Version:** v1.0 or later with community node support.\n* **Permissions:** Webhook access, credential vault read/write.\n\n👤 **Who Is This For?**\n\n* Real-estate agencies and brokers seeking to automate client queries.\n* PropTech startups building conversational search tools.\n* Data analysts who want on-demand property snapshots without manual scraping.\n\n📈 **Benefits & Use Cases**\n\n* **Time Savings:** Replace manual MLS searches with an AI-driven chat.\n* **Scalability:** Serve multiple clients simultaneously via webchat or embedded widget.\n* **Consistency:** Always report exactly three properties, ensuring concise results.\n* **Engagement:** Visual listings with images boost user satisfaction and conversion.\n\n\n*Workflow created and verified by Miquel Colomer [https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelcolomersalas/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquelcolomersalas/) and N8nHackers [https://n8nhackers.com](https://n8nhackers.com)*\n",
