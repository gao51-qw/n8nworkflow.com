  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow automates LinkedIn posting for businesses and personal brands.  \nIt starts with a form where you submit your post idea. Then:\n1. **Message Model (OpenAI)** generates the LinkedIn post text in a professional and engaging style.  \n2. **Image Generation (OpenAI)** creates a custom visual to match the post idea and brand style.  \n3. **LinkedIn Node** publishes the text + image directly to your LinkedIn account.  \n\nThis way, you can go from idea → AI-written post → branded visual → live LinkedIn content, all in one automated flow.  \n\n## Setup steps\n- Connect your **Form Trigger** (or replace with Google Forms/Typeform/Notion etc. if you prefer).  \n- Configure **OpenAI credentials** for text and image generation.  \n- Adjust the AI prompts with your own details: `[business name]`, `[founder name]`, `[brand colors]`, `[tone of voice]`.  \n- Connect your **LinkedIn account** in the final node.  \n\n## Requirements\n- OpenAI API key (for text + image generation)  \n- LinkedIn account with API access  \n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)  \n",
