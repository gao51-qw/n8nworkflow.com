## What problem is this workflow solving?

Finding qualified prospects on LinkedIn manually is time-consuming and inefficient. Traditional methods involve:
- Manually searching LinkedIn with limited search capabilities
- Copy-pasting profile information one by one
- Struggling with LinkedIn's search limitations and restrictions
- Difficulty organizing and tracking prospect data
- No systematic way to avoid duplicate contacts

This workflow solves these challenges by leveraging Google's powerful search capabilities to find LinkedIn profiles at scale, automatically extracting key information, and organizing everything in a structured database.

## What this workflow does

The workflow performs intelligent LinkedIn prospect discovery through these key steps:

1. **Keyword-Based Search**: Uses Google Custom Search API to find LinkedIn profiles matching your specific criteria (job titles, industries, locations)
2. **Smart Data Extraction**: Automatically parses profile titles, descriptions, URLs, and search snippets from Google results
3. **Structured Storage**: Saves all prospect data to Airtable with proper field mapping and automatic deduplication
4. **Pagination Handling**: Automatically processes multiple pages of search results to maximize prospect discovery
5. **Rate Limiting**: Includes built-in delays to respect API limits and ensure reliable operation

Key features:
- **Deduplication**: Prevents storing duplicate LinkedIn profiles
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large prospect lists efficiently
- **Customizable Search**: Easily modify keywords to target different professional segments
- **Clean Data Output**: Structured data ready for outreach campaigns
