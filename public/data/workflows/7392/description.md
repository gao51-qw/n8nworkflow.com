# Custom Interface for GLPI with n8n

Transform your GLPI system's user experience with a modern, optimized web interface that simplifies technical support ticket creation.
How it works

Unified entry portal: Users access an intuitive web form where they select between "Request" or "Incident"
Custom data collection: Specific forms adapt fields based on ticket type, requesting only relevant information
Automatic processing: The system automatically maps categories and priorities, creates tickets in GLPI via REST API
File management: Allows document attachments that are automatically linked to the created ticket
Confirmation and tracking: Provides the generated ticket ID for future follow-up
