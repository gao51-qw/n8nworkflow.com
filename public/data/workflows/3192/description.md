This n8n template empowers IT support teams by automating document ingestion and instant query resolution through a conversational AI. It integrates **Google Drive**, **Pinecone**, and a Chat AI agent (using Google Gemini/OpenRouter) to transform static support documents into an interactive, searchable knowledge base. With two interlinked workflows—one for processing support documents and one for handling chat queries—employees receive fast, context-aware answers directly from your support documentation.

## Overview

### Document Ingestion Workflow
- **Google Drive Trigger:** Monitors a specified folder for new file uploads (e.g., updated support documents).
- **File Download & Extraction:** Automatically downloads new files and extracts text content.
- **Data Cleaning & Text Splitting:** Utilizes a Code node to remove line breaks, trim extra spaces, and strip special characters, while a text splitter segments the content into manageable chunks.
- **Embedding & Storage:** Generates text embeddings using Google Gemini and stores them in a Pinecone vector store for rapid similarity search.

### Chat Query Workflow
- **Chat Trigger:** Initiates when an employee sends a support query.
- **Vector Search & Context Retrieval:** Retrieves the top relevant document segments from Pinecone based on similarity scores.
- **Prompt Construction:** A Code node combines the retrieved document snippets with the user’s query into a detailed prompt.
- **AI Agent Response:** The constructed prompt is sent to an AI agent (using OpenRouter Chat Model) to generate a clear, step-by-step solution.

## Key Benefits & Use Case

Imagine a large organization where every IT support document—from troubleshooting guides to system configurations—is stored in a single Google Drive folder. When an employee encounters an issue (e.g., “How do I reset my VPN credentials?”), they simply type the query into a chat interface. Instantly, the workflow retrieves the most relevant context from the ingested documents and provides a detailed, actionable answer. This process reduces resolution times, enhances support consistency, and significantly lightens the load on IT staff.

## Prerequisites
- A valid **Google Drive** account with access to the designated folder.
- A **Pinecone** account for storing and retrieving text embeddings.
- **Google Gemini** (or **OpenRouter**) credentials to power the Chat AI agent.
- An operational **n8n** instance configured with the necessary nodes and credentials.

## Workflow Details

### 1 Document Ingestion Workflow
- **Google Drive Trigger Node:**  
   - Listens for file creation events in the specified folder.
- **Google Drive Download Node:**  
   - Downloads the newly added file.
- **Extract from File Node:**  
   - Extracts text content from the downloaded file.
- **Code Node (Data Cleaning):**  
   - Cleans the extracted text by removing line breaks, trimming spaces, and eliminating special characters.
- **Recursive Text Splitter Node:**  
   - Segments the cleaned text into manageable chunks.
- **Pinecone Vector Store Node:**  
   - Generates embeddings (via Google Gemini) and uploads the chunks to Pinecone.

### 2 Chat Query Workflow
- **Chat Trigger Node:**  
   - Receives incoming user queries.
- **Pinecone Vector Store Node (Query):**  
   - Searches for relevant document chunks based on the query.
- **Code Node (Context Builder):**  
   - Sorts the retrieved documents by relevance and constructs a prompt merging the context with the query.
- **AI Agent Node:**  
   - Sends the prompt to the Chat AI agent, which returns a detailed answer.

## How to Use

1. **Import the Template:**  
   - Import the template into your n8n instance.
2. **Configure the Google Drive Trigger:**  
   - Set the folder ID (e.g., `1RQvAHIw8cQbtwI9ZvdVV0k0x6TM6H12P`) and connect your Google Drive credentials.
3. **Set Up Pinecone Nodes:**  
   - Enter your Pinecone index details and credentials.
4. **Configure the Chat AI Agent:**  
   - Provide your Google Gemini (or OpenRouter) API credentials.
5. **Test the Workflows:**  
   - Validate the document ingestion workflow by uploading a sample support document.
   - Validate the chat query workflow by sending a test query and verifying the returned support information.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure all credentials (Google Drive, Pinecone, and Chat AI) are correctly set up and tested before deploying the workflows in production.
- The template is fully customizable. Adjust the text cleaning, splitting parameters, or the number of document chunks retrieved based on your support documentation's size and structure.
- This template not only enhances IT support efficiency but also offers a scalable solution for managing and leveraging growing volumes of support content.
