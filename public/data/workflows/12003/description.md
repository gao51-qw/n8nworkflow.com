- Personal Chatbot

**Prerequisites:**
- OpenAI API Key
- Gemini API Key

**How to set up:**

1. Create a telegram bot using BotFather, and the BotFather will give you an API key
2. Copy the API key and set it up in a Telegram node inside n8n
3. Get a free gemini api from https://aistudio.google.com/
