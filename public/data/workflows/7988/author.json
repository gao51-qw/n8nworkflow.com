  "bio": "I’m currently obsessed with building cool things using AI automation and AI agents — systems that save time, cut manual work, and actually do stuff on their own. If there’s a way to automate it, I’m probably already trying it out (or planning to). Having worked in IT industry for 15 years, I’m combining that background with AI to help businesses move smarter, not just faster.\n",
