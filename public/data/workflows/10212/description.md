### How it works

This workflow automates the end-to-end process of generating AI videos and publishing them to TikTok. It is triggered either manually or on a recurring schedule.

1.  **Trigger & Data Fetch:** The workflow starts by checking a specified Form for new entries. It looks for rows where a video has been requested (a "PROMPT" is filled) but not yet generated (the "VIDEO" column is empty).

2.  **AI Video Generation:** For each new prompt found, the workflow sends a request to the **Fal.ai Sora 2** model to generate a video. It then enters a polling loop, repeatedly checking the status of the generation request every 60 seconds until the video is "COMPLETED".

3.  **Post-Processing & Upload:** Once the video is ready, the workflow performs several actions in parallel:
    *   **Fetch Video & Store:** It retrieves the final video URL, downloads the video file
    *   **Generate Title:** It uses the **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** model to analyze the original prompt and generate an optimized, engaging title for the video.
    *   **Publish to TikTok:** The video file is uploaded to **Postiz**, a social media scheduling tool, which then automatically publishes it to a connected TikTok channel, using the AI-generated title as the post's caption.

### Set up steps

To make this workflow functional, you need to complete the following configuration steps:

1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**
    *   Create a Form with at least "PROMPT", "DURATION", and "VIDEO" fields.

2.  **Configure Fal.ai for Video Generation:**
    *   Create an account at [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain your API key.
    *   In both the **"Create Video"** and **"Get status"** HTTP Request nodes, set up the "Header Auth" credential.
    *   Set the `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.

3.  **Set up TikTok Publishing via Postiz:**
    *   Create an account on [Postiz](https://postiz.com/) and connect your TikTok account to get a **Channel ID**.
    *   Obtain your Postiz API key.
    *   In the **"Upload Video to Postiz"** and **"TikTok" (Postiz)** nodes, configure the API credentials.
    *   In the **"TikTok"** node, replace the placeholder `"XXX"` in the `integrationId` field with your actual TikTok Channel ID from Postiz.

4.  **(Optional) Configure AI Title Generation:**
    *   The **"Generate title"** node uses OpenAI. Ensure you have valid OpenAI API credentials configured in n8n for this node to work.
