## 🚀 Enrich CRM Leads with LinkedIn Company Data Using AI

### **Who's it for**
Sales teams, marketers, and business development professionals who need to automatically enrich their CRM records with detailed company information from LinkedIn profiles. Perfect for anyone doing B2B outreach who wants to personalize their messaging at scale.

### **What it does**
This workflow transforms bare-bones lead records into rich, personalized prospect profiles by:
- Automatically scraping LinkedIn company profiles
- Using AI (GPT-4) to extract key business intelligence
- Generating 15+ email-ready personalization variables
- Updating your CRM with structured, actionable data

The workflow pulls company overviews, products/services, funding information, recent posts, and converts everything into natural-language variables that can be dropped directly into your outreach templates.

### **How it works**
1. **Trigger**: Workflow starts when a new lead is added to Airtable (or on schedule)
2. **Fetch**: Retrieves the lead record containing the LinkedIn company URL
3. **Scrape**: Pulls the raw HTML from the company's LinkedIn profile
4. **Clean**: Strips HTML tags and formats content for AI processing
5. **Analyze**: GPT-4 extracts structured company intelligence (overview, products, market presence, recent posts)
6. **Transform**: Converts analysis into 15+ email-ready variables with natural phrasing
7. **Update**: Writes enriched data back to your CRM

### **Setup Requirements**
- **Airtable account** (free tier works fine)
- **OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o-mini recommended for cost-effectiveness)
- **LinkedIn company URLs** stored in your CRM
- **5 minutes** for initial configuration
