## Seamlessly Sync and Update Data from a csv in OneDrive to Excel with n8n

This workflow is perfect for users who need a reliable, automated way to transfer and organize data from OneDrive into Excel—especially for tasks like portfolio tracking, inventory management, and record-keeping. By monitoring your OneDrive folder for new CSV files, it performs data cleaning, transformation, and real-time updates in an Excel sheet, ensuring only new or changed records are added.

## How it Works

1. **Automated Monitoring**: Every minute, the workflow scans a designated OneDrive folder for new files.
2. **File Verification**: It checks if the detected file is in CSV format; if not, the process stops with an error message.
3. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: CSV data is loaded, and irrelevant headers are removed before mapping to specified columns in Excel.
4. **Excel Update**: The workflow maps data to your Excel sheet, updating only new or modified entries based on a unique identifier ("Ticker/ISIN").
5. **Cleanup**: To keep your OneDrive organized, processed files are deleted after updating Excel.
