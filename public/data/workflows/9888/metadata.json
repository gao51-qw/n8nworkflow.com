  "description": "🎧 Automated Spotify Playlist Organizer — Sort and Queue Tracks by Popularity\n\n🧠 Overview\n\nThis workflow acts as your AI-powered Spotify DJ assistant.\nIt retrieves your playlists, cleans and organizes them, sorts tracks by popularity, and automatically queues them for playback — creating a ready-to-play, personalized listening session.\n\n⸻\n\n⚙️ Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1.

Clean & Deduplicate\n\nNode: Clean & Deduplicate (Code node)\nThis JavaScript block:\n\t•\tNormalizes input (handles arrays and multiple items).\n\t•\tExtracts only useful fields: name, uri, total.\n\t•\tFilters out playlists missing data.\n\t•\tRemoves duplicates by URI.\n\n🧹 Result: a clean, uniform list of your playlists.\n\n⸻\n\n4.
