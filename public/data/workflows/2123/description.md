# What it does
The workflow is a simple yet efficient way to automate the process of indexing your website on Google using the Google Indexing API.

# How it works

It works by extracting information from your sitemap, converting it into a JSON file, and looping through each URL to submit it for indexing. 


Here's a brief rundown of the workflow:

1. The workflow can be triggered manually via the "Execute Workflow" button or scheduled to run at a specific time using the "Schedule Trigger" node.

2. The sitemap of your website is fetched using the "sitemap_set" node with a HTTP Request to the sitemap URL. 

3. This XML sitemap is then converted into a JSON file using the "sitemap_convert" node.

4. The "sitemap_parse" node splits the JSON file into individual URLs.

5. The "url_set" node then prepares each URL to be sent to the Google Indexing API.

6. A loop is created using the "loop" node to process each URL individually and make a POST request to Google Indexing API indicating that the URL has been updated.

7. If the POST request is successful and the URL has been updated, the workflow waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next URL.

8. In case the daily limit for the Google Indexing API is reached (200/day by default), an error message is triggered using the "Stop and Error" node.
