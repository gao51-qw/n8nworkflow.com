  "description": "### Overview  \n\n- This workflow acts as an AI-powered research assistant that takes a topic from the user, performs multi-step intelligent research, and stores the final report in Notion. It uses advanced search, content extraction, and AI summarization to deliver a high-quality research report—fully automated from query to publication.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works  \n- **User Interaction**  \n  - The workflow starts by asking the user what topic they want to research.  \n  - A “Strategy Agent” asks 2–3 clarifying questions to refine the scope.  \n  - Once the user confirms, it creates a **Notion database page** with the research title.\n\n- **Search Query Generation**  \n  - Generates up to **3 relevant search queries** for the given topic.\n\n- **Data Gathering** (Loop over each query)  \n  - Sends the query to **Tavily Search API** to find the most relevant blogs/articles.  \n  - Picks the top-matched link and uses Tavily again to extract its content.  \n  - Repeats the process for all 3 queries.\n\n- **Report Compilation**  \n  - Aggregates extracted content from all sources.  \n  - A **Final Report Agent** creates a well-structured research report in **Markdown**.  \n  - Converts Markdown → HTML → splits into chunks.  \n  - Pushes each chunk into the Notion report page.  \n\n- **Delivery**  \n  - Sends the **final Notion report link** back to the user.\n\n---\n\n### How to Use  \n- This workflow is triggered via **Webhook**.  \n- **Attach the provided webhook URL** to any application, form, or chatbot to collect the user’s topic.  \n- Once triggered, the workflow will run automatically and deliver the research link without any manual steps.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements  \nTo use this workflow, you’ll need:  \n- **n8n account** (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- **Notion account** with a database where reports will be stored  \n- **Tavily API Key** – for search & content extraction  \n- **OpenRouter API key** *or* **OpenAI API key** – for AI agents & report generation  \n- **Google Gemini API Key** – for converting Markdown to HTML and splitting content for Notion  \n- Notion database ID connected in n8n\n",
