## Use Cases
1. Tech Startup (100 Employees, High Growth)
Engineer resigns to join competitor. AI detects compensation issue (40% below market), flags manager micromanagement concerns, and identifies preventable departure (preventability: 85%). HR immediately initiates compensation review for engineering team, schedules manager coaching, and retains 3 other engineers considering leaving. Access to codebase revoked automatically on last day. Boomerang probability: 70% - maintains relationship for future recruiting.
2. Healthcare System (500 Nurses)
Nurse leaves citing burnout. AI identifies systemic staffing issues in ER department affecting 15% of departures. Flags potential HIPAA violation concern requiring investigation. Automatically revokes EHR access on final day. Equipment recovery (badge, pager, scrubs) tracked with 100% success. Exit insights lead to ER staffing model changes, reducing nurse turnover by 30%.
3. Financial Services Firm
Compliance officer departs. AI red flags potential ethics concern requiring immediate investigation. Legal team notified within minutes. Knowledge transfer flagged as "critical risk" due to regulatory expertise. Detailed 30-day handover plan auto-generated. All system access revoked immediately. Complete audit trail maintained for regulatory review. Investigation reveals process gap, not ethical issue, preventing regulatory exposure.
4. Retail Chain (2,000 Employees)
Store manager exits. AI aggregates insights across 50 recent retail departures, identifying district manager as common thread (manager rating consistently 2/5). Regional HR intervenes with district manager coaching. Equipment return (keys, registers codes, uniforms) automated via checklist. 95% equipment recovery vs previous 60%. Sentiment trends show seasonal staff prefer flexible scheduling - policy updated chain-wide.
Remote Software Company
5. Developer in different timezone resigns. Automated offboarding coordinates across 3 time zones: access revoked at EOD local time, equipment return label emailed internationally, knowledge transfer scheduled with overlap hours. AI detects "career growth" as preventable issue - company implements career ladder framework, reducing senior developer attrition by 45%.

## Pro Tips

1. Timing Matters: Send Jotform link 1 week before last day for honest feedback (not on exit day)
2. Anonymity Option: Consider anonymous feedback for more candid responses (separate form)
3. Benchmark Scoring: After 50+ exits, calculate your company's average preventability score
4. Manager Patterns: Track exits by manager to identify coaching needs early
5. Department Trends: Monthly reviews of AI insights by department for systemic issues
6. Compensation Data: Cross-reference "compensation issue" flags with market data
7. Boomerang Program: Create formal alumni network for high-probability boomerang candidates
8. Equipment Deposits: Consider requiring deposits for easier equipment recovery
9. Exit Interview Training: Train managers on how to act on AI insights constructively
10. Legal Review: Have legal team review red flag escalation categories quarterly
11. Continuous Improvement: Use AI recommendations to create quarterly retention action plans
12. Stay Interviews: Use exit interview insights to inform "stay interview" questions for current employees
