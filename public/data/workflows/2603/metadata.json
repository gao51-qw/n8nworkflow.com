  "description": "This n8n template showcases a cool feature of n8n Forms where the form itself can be defined dynamically using the [form fields schema](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/#defining-the-form-using-json).\n\nIt may be debateable how useful this template actually is since both [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/cKzxFYVc) and [Baserow](https://baserow.io) provide form interfaces already but still a great exercise and demonstration if ever the use-case comes around.\n\n## How it works\n* A form trigger is used to dynamically select a database/table from which to build the n8n form from.\n* the table's schema is imported into the workflow and using the code node, is converted into the n8n form fields schema.\n* This let's us dynamically build the fields in our n8n form when we choose to define the form using the JSON option.\n* Once the n8n form submits, we convert the values back into our table's API schema so that we can create a new row.\n* Note any files/attachments fields are removed as they need to be handled separately.\n* Files are processed separately as they may first need to be stored. Once complete, the reference is saved into the newly created row.\n\n**Check out the example Airtable here** - [https://airtable.com/appfP15Xd0aVZR9xV/shrGFgXLyQ4Jg58SU](https://airtable.com/appfP15Xd0aVZR9xV/shrGFgXLyQ4Jg58SU)\n\n## How to use\n* The n8n form is autogenerated which means you only need provide access to the table. Using this approach, this template can be reused for any number of Airtable and/or Baserow tables.\n\n## Requirements\n* You'll need either an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/cKzxFYVc) or a [Baserow](https://baserow.io) account to use this template.\n* Accessible n8n instance to your users\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Not using either Airtable or Baserow? Theoretically any datastore which provides a fields schema can be used with this template.\n* If you're feeling creative, split the table into multiple forms for a better user experience.",
