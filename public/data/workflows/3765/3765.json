    "description": "### Description\nCandidate Engagement | Resume Screening | AI Voice Interviews | Applicant Insights\n\nThis intelligent n8n workflow automates the process of extracting and scoring resumes received through a company career page, populating a Notion database with AI insights where the recruiter or hiring manager can automatically invite the applicant to an instant interview with an Elevenlabs AI voice agent.  After the agent conducts the behavior-based interview, the workflow scores the overall interview against customizable evaluation criteria and updates the Notion database with AI insights about the applicant.\n\n[AI Powered Resume Screening & Voice AI that interviews like a Recruiter!](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=197WXAPUe0256SJniNEbBQ8A9QNByaLCM)\n\n[AI Insights in Notion dashboard](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19A7qjEjN0hCUNVwxxsUyh3TUUqYziPg1)\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nHR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals\n\nThis workflow is ideal for HR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals looking for a foundational, extensible framework to automate early stage recruiting. Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or scaling automation across your hiring process, this template provides a base for screening, interviewing, and tracking candidates—powered entirely by n8n, Elevenlabs, Notion, and LLM integrations.  Be sure to consult State and Country regulations with respect to AI Compliance, AI Bias Audits, AI Risk Assessment, and disclosure requirements.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nManually screening resumes and conducting initial interviews slows down hiring. This template automates:\n\n**Resume assessment against job description.**\n\n**Scheduling first and second round interviews.**\n\n**First-round AI-led behavioral interviews with AI scoring assessment.**\n\n**Centralized tracking of AI assessments in Notion.**\n\n### What this does\n\nThis customizable tool, configured to manage 3 requisitions in parallel, automates the application process, resume screen, and first round behavioral interviews. \n\n### Pre-screen Applicants with AI\n\nImmediately screens and scores applicant’s resume  against the job description.  The AI Agent generates a score and an AI assessment, adding both to the applicant's profile in Notion.  Notion automatically notifies hiring manager when a resume receives a score of 8 or higher.\n\n### Voice AI that Interviews like a Recruiter\n\nAI Voice agent adapts probing questions based on applicant’s response and intelligently dives deeper into skill and experience to assess answers against a scoring rubric for each question.  \n\n### AI Applicant Insights in Notion\n\nGet detailed post-interview AI analysis, including interview recordings and question-by-question scoring breakdowns to help identify who you should advance to the next stage in the process.  \n\nAI insight provided in Notion ATS dashboard with drag and drop to advance top candidates to the next interview stage.\n\n### How it works\n[Link to Notion Template](https://www.notion.so/marketplace/templates/ai-recruiter?cr=cre%3Aculturedatasolutions)\n### Notion Career Page:\n\nNotion Career Page published to web, can be integrated with your preferred job board posting system.\n\n### Notion Job Posting:\n\nGateway for applicants to apply to active requisitions with ‘Click to Apply’ button.\n\n### Application Form:\n\nN8N webform embedded into Notion job posting captures applicant information and routes for AI processing.\n\n### AI Agent evaluates resume against job description\n\nAI Agent evaluates resume against the job description, stored in Notion, and scores the applicant on a scale of 1 to 10, providing rationale for score.\n\n### Creates ATS record in Notion with assessment and score\n\nWorkflow creates the applicant record in the Notion ATS where Recruiters and Hiring Managers see applicants in a filtered view, sorted by AI generated resume score.  Users can automatically advance applicants to the next step in process (AI Conversation interview) with drag and drop functionality. \n\n### Invites applicant to an Instant AI Interview\n\nDragging the applicant to AI Interview step in the Notion ATS dashboard triggers Notion automation that sends the applicant an email with a link to the Elevenlabs Conversation AI Agent.  The AI Conversation Agent is provided with instructions on how to conduct the behavior-based interview, including probing questions, for the specific role.\n\n### AI Conversation Agent Behavior Based Interview\n\nThe email link resolves to an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) AI Conversation agent that has been instructed to interview applicants using pre-defined interview questions, scoring rubric, job description, and company profile.  The Elevenlabs agent assesses the applicant on a scale of 1 to 5 for each interview question and provides an overall assessment of the interview based on established evaluation criteria.\n\n\n[Click to hear AI Voice Agent in action](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16YgEnDt4RWU1U7i_la5b3jGNDUcMpvdx)\n\n\nExample:\n**Role:** IT Support Analyst\n**Mark:**  Elevenlabs AI Agent instructed to interview applicants for specific role\n**Gemini:** Google AI coached to answer questions as an IT Support Analyst being interviewed\n\n\n### Updates Notion record with Interview Assessment and Score\n\nAll results—including the conversation transcript, interview scores, and rationale for assessment are automatically added back to the applicant’s profile in Notion where the Hiring Manager can validate the AI assessment by skimming through the embedded audio file.\n\nAI Interview Overall Score: **1 to 5** based on response to all questions and probes.\n\n\nAI Agent confirms that it was able to evaluate the interview using the assigned rubric.\n\nAI Interview Criteria Score: **Success/Failure** based on response to individual interview questions.\n\n\n\n### Invites applicant to second interview with Hiring Manager\n\nDragging the applicant to the **‘Hiring Manager Interview’** step in the Notion ATS dashboard triggers a Notion automation that sends an email with a link to the Hiring Manager’s calendar scheduling solution. \n\n### Configuration and Set Up\n### Accounts & API Keys\nYou wil need accounts and credentials for:\n\nn8n (hosted or self-hosted) \nElevenlabs (for AI Conversation Agent) \nGemini (for LLM model access)\nGoogle Drive (to back up applicant data)\nCalendly (to automate interview scheduling)\nGmail (to automate interview scheduling)\n\n### Data / Documents to implement\n\nJob Descriptions for each role\nInterview questions for each role\nEvaluation criteria for each interview question\n\n### Notion Set Up\n\n\n### Customize your Notion Career Page\n[Link to Free Notion Template that enables workflow:](https://www.notion.so/marketplace/templates/ai-recruiter?cr=cre%3Aculturedatasolutions)\n\n### Update Notion job description database\n-update **job description(s)** for each role\n-add **interview questions** to the job description database page in Notion\n-add **evaluation criteria** to the job description database page in Notion\n-edit each **‘Click to Apply’ button** in the job description template so it resolves to the corresponding N8N 'Application Form' webform production URL (detail provided below)\n\n### Notion Applicant Tracker\n\nIn the Applicant Tracker database, update position titles, tab headings, in the custom database view (Notion) so it reflects the title of the position you are posting.
