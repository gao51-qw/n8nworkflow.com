### Who is this for?

HR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals

This workflow is ideal for HR teams, recruiters, and talent acquisition professionals looking for a foundational, extensible framework to automate early stage recruiting. Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or scaling automation across your hiring process, this template provides a base for screening, interviewing, and tracking candidates—powered entirely by n8n, Elevenlabs, Notion, and LLM integrations.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually screening resumes and conducting initial interviews slows down hiring. This template automates:

**Resume assessment against job description.**

**Scheduling first and second round interviews.**

**First-round AI-led behavioral interviews with AI scoring assessment.**

**Centralized tracking of AI assessments in Notion.**

### What this does

This customizable tool, configured to manage 3 requisitions in parallel, automates the application process, resume screen, and first round behavioral interviews. 

### Pre-screen Applicants with AI

Immediately screens and scores applicant’s resume  against the job description.  The AI Agent generates a score and an AI assessment, adding both to the applicant's profile in Notion.  Notion automatically notifies hiring manager when a resume receives a score of 8 or higher.

### Voice AI that Interviews like a Recruiter

AI Voice agent adapts probing questions based on applicant’s response and intelligently dives deeper into skill and experience to assess answers against a scoring rubric for each question.  

### AI Applicant Insights in Notion

Get detailed post-interview AI analysis, including interview recordings and question-by-question scoring breakdowns to help identify who you should advance to the next stage in the process.  

AI insight provided in Notion ATS dashboard with drag and drop to advance top candidates to the next interview stage.

### Notion Career Page:

Notion Career Page published to web, can be integrated with your preferred job board posting system.

### Notion Job Posting:

Gateway for applicants to apply to active requisitions with ‘Click to Apply’ button.

### Application Form:

N8N webform embedded into Notion job posting captures applicant information and routes for AI processing.

### AI Agent evaluates resume against job description

AI Agent evaluates resume against the job description, stored in Notion, and scores the applicant on a scale of 1 to 10, providing rationale for score.

### Creates ATS record in Notion with assessment and score

Workflow creates the applicant record in the Notion ATS where Recruiters and Hiring Managers see applicants in a filtered view, sorted by AI generated resume score.  Users can automatically advance applicants to the next step in process (AI Conversation interview) with drag and drop functionality. 

### Invites applicant to an Instant AI Interview

Dragging the applicant to AI Interview step in the Notion ATS dashboard triggers Notion automation that sends the applicant an email with a link to the Elevenlabs Conversation AI Agent.  The AI Conversation Agent is provided with instructions on how to conduct the behavior-based interview, including probing questions, for the specific role.

### AI Conversation Agent Behavior Based Interview

The email link resolves to an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) AI Conversation agent that has been instructed to interview applicants using pre-defined interview questions, scoring rubric, job description, and company profile.  The Elevenlabs agent assesses the applicant on a scale of 1 to 5 for each interview question and provides an overall assessment of the interview based on established evaluation criteria.
