### How It Works

1.  **Scheduled Daily Trigger**: The workflow runs automatically every day at 6 AM IST, ensuring you always have fresh content ideas to start your day.
2.  **AI-Powered News Gathering**: It uses **Perplexity AI** to fetch the latest, most interesting, and relevant stories across three key AI topics:
    * **Topic 1**: General AI News
    * **Topic 2**: AI Market and Industry Trends
    * **Topic 3**: AI Business Automation
3.  **Organize and Combine Content**: The information from each topic is organized, and then all content and their respective citations are combined into a single, comprehensive input.
4.  **Personalize "About Me"**: Crucially, a configurable "About me" node allows you to define the personal brand of the founder (e.g., Name, Niche, Business Name, Business Type). This context is fed to the AI to ensure generated content aligns perfectly with your persona and business objectives.
5.  **Generate Content Packages**: Leveraging **OpenAI (acting as "CreatorAI")**, the workflow takes the combined news and your "About me" information to:
    * **Identify a Unique Angle**: Finds a distinct, engaging angle from the input that aligns with key content pillars (e.g., AI solving business pain points, future of work with AI).
    * **Craft Video Scripts**: Generates concise video scripts (under 700 characters) with powerful hooks, mini-narratives (problem → AI solution → impact), and a focus on tangible business benefits. It subtly references your business as a thought leader, not a direct pitch.
    * **Write Captions**: Creates friendly, expert-toned captions with engaging hooks, more context, a clear call to action (e.g., "Comment 'Workflow' for more"), and relevant hashtags.
    * **Design Text Overlays**: Produces short, punchy text overlays (3-7 words, ALL CAPS or Title Case) perfect for video thumbnails or initial screens.
6.  **Save to Google Sheet**: Each generated content package (Text Overlay, Video Script, Caption) is appended as a new row in your designated Google Sheet ("Content Idea" sheet within "Video Automation (Vansh)").
7.  **Notify User**: Finally, you'll receive an email notification confirming that new content ideas have been generated and saved to your Google Sheet.
