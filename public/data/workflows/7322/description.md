- Tracks selected flights and sends real-time price alerts.
- Provides 24/7 AI-powered travel recommendations.

# Set up steps
- **Add credentials** for your chosen Chat Model (DeepSeek in this case) and SerpAPI (Google Flights).
- In the **AI Agent** node, link:
  - Chat Model → **DeepSeek Chat Model** node.
  - Memory → **Simple Memory** node (for conversation context).
  - Tool → **Google_flights search in SerpApi** node.
- In the **SerpApi** node, set `engine=google_flights` and map input fields for departure, destination, and travel dates.
- Test the workflow by providing a sample itinerary request in the **Chat** node’s input.
- Review AI responses to ensure it searches, compares, and returns relevant flight options.
