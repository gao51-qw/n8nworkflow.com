  "description": "## 📖 Description  \n\n### 🔹 How it works  \nThis workflow introduces an **AI + Human-in-the-Loop pipeline** for employee timesheet management. It combines the power of **Google Drive, AI (OCR + LLM), and Gmail** with a **human review step** to ensure accuracy and compliance.  \n\n1. **AI-Powered File Discovery**  \n   - Scans a Google Drive folder for new or updated timesheet files (PDF, Word, Excel, Images).  \n\n2. **AI Data Extraction**  \n   - Uses OCR and LLM (Mistral) to intelligently read and extract structured data. \n   -  Supports **multiple formats**: PDF, Word (DOC/DOCX), Excel (XLS/XLSX), and Image files (JPG, PNG, scanned documents).   \n   - Creates clean JSON with file details and timesheet logs (date, hours worked, tasks, notes).  \n\n3. **Smart Data Formatting**  \n   - Converts AI output into a **clear HTML summary table** for easy review.  \n   - Flags potential anomalies (missing hours, duplicate dates, irregular entries).  \n\n4. **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**  \n   - Sends an approval email via Gmail containing:  \n     - File metadata  \n     - AI-generated HTML summary  \n     - JSON attachment of raw extracted data  \n   - HR/Managers review the summary and **approve/reject** before final actions occur.  \n\n5. **Post-Approval Automation** *(optional)*  \n   - Approved records can be saved in a separate Google Drive folder.  \n   - Employees or HR receive confirmation emails.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Set up steps  \n\n1. **Connect Credentials**  \n   - Add Google Drive and Gmail credentials in n8n.  \n   - Configure Mistral (or any LLM) API credentials. \n\n2. **Configure Google Drive**  \n   - In the “Search files and folders” node, replace the `folderId` with your company’s timesheet folder ID.  \n\n3. **Customize Extraction Schema**  \n   - Sticky notes explain how JSON output is structured.  \n   - Adapt it for your organization’s needs (e.g., overtime, project codes).  \n\n4. **Set Up Human Verification Emails**  \n   - Update Gmail node recipients to your HR or approval team.  \n   - Customize the email body (AI summary + JSON file attached).  \n\n5. **Activate & Test**  \n   - Enable the workflow.  \n   - Upload a sample timesheet to trigger the AI + human verification loop.  \n\n---\n\n  \n\n\n\n⚡ **Result:** A robust **AI + Human-in-the-Loop workflow** that reduces repetitive data entry, prevents payroll errors, and gives HR full confidence before final approval.
