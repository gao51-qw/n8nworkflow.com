**Automate Facebook Messenger orders to Google Sheets and Google Calendar**

---

## Introduction

This workflow automates **Facebook Messenger order management** by connecting your Facebook Page with **Google Sheets** and **Google Calendar**.

It’s designed to help small businesses save time, reduce errors, and streamline order-taking. Every time a customer messages your page, they receive a structured order form, their responses are parsed, and the details are saved directly to Google Sheets. The same workflow also creates a Google Calendar event, ensuring you never miss a delivery or pickup schedule.

## Requirements
