Managing your inbox can feel like a full-time job. Some emails deserve an instant response, others need thoughtful handling, and many don’t need a reply at all. 

This workflow takes that weight off your shoulders by combining **AI intelligence** with **human oversight**, so you spend less time sorting and more time focusing on what matters.

## Why This Workflow Matters

Think about how much energy gets drained just deciding:
- Should I reply to this now?
- Is this too sensitive for an automatic response?
- Or is this just noise I can safely ignore?

This workflow does that decision-making for you. With the help of Google Gemini, it reads each incoming email, categorizes it, and then either:
- Replies instantly with a warm, professional message,  
- Prepares a draft reply for you to review,  
- Or does nothing if the message is irrelevant.  

It’s like having a personal assistant who knows when to step in and when to leave things for you.

## Benefits You’ll Notice

- **Clarity in your inbox**: No more second-guessing which emails need your attention.  
- **Faster replies**: Routine messages get answered automatically in seconds.  
- **Peace of mind**: Sensitive or complex topics are flagged for your review, you’re always in control.  
- **Less mental clutter**: By ignoring noise (marketing blasts, spam, automated notifications), you can focus on meaningful conversations.  
- **Consistency**: Every reply feels polite, professional, and human, without you lifting a finger.  

Over time, you’ll notice your inbox feels lighter, your response times improve, and your focus shifts back to real work rather than inbox triage.

## How It Works
1. **Gmail Trigger** catches every new incoming email.  
2. **AI Categorizer** decides whether the message should be:  
   - **Reply** (safe to answer immediately),  
   - **Draft** (needs your review),  
   - **Nothing** (ignore).  
3. **AI Writer** generates either a ready-to-send reply or a draft that feels natural and professional.  
4. **Gmail Integration** then either sends, drafts, or ignores, based on the AI’s decision.

## FAQ

**Q: Will this replace my judgment entirely?**  
No. It only automates what’s safe. Complex or sensitive emails are always drafted for you to review.  

**Q: Can I customize how the AI writes replies?**  
Yes. You can adjust the prompt inside the workflow to match your own style and tone.  

**Q: What happens if the AI misclassifies an email?**  
At worst, you’ll get a draft instead of an auto-reply. You’ll never lose control over sensitive communication.  

**Q: Does this cost extra to run?**  
Using Gmail via n8n is free, but you’ll need Google Gemini API access, which may come with its own usage limits or costs.

⚠️ **Important Note**:  
This workflow comes with **no support**. You need to be comfortable working with n8n, credentials, and AI nodes on your own. It’s provided as-is for the community to experiment with and adapt.
