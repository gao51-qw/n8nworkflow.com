  "description": "Managing your inbox can feel like a full-time job. Some emails deserve an instant response, others need thoughtful handling, and many don’t need a reply at all. \n\nThis workflow takes that weight off your shoulders by combining **AI intelligence** with **human oversight**, so you spend less time sorting and more time focusing on what matters.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Workflow Matters\n\nThink about how much energy gets drained just deciding:\n- Should I reply to this now?\n- Is this too sensitive for an automatic response?\n- Or is this just noise I can safely ignore?\n\nThis workflow does that decision-making for you. With the help of Google Gemini, it reads each incoming email, categorizes it, and then either:\n- Replies instantly with a warm, professional message,  \n- Prepares a draft reply for you to review,  \n- Or does nothing if the message is irrelevant.  \n\nIt’s like having a personal assistant who knows when to step in and when to leave things for you.\n\n---\n\n## Benefits You’ll Notice\n\n- **Clarity in your inbox**: No more second-guessing which emails need your attention.  \n- **Faster replies**: Routine messages get answered automatically in seconds.  \n- **Peace of mind**: Sensitive or complex topics are flagged for your review, you’re always in control.  \n- **Less mental clutter**: By ignoring noise (marketing blasts, spam, automated notifications), you can focus on meaningful conversations.  \n- **Consistency**: Every reply feels polite, professional, and human, without you lifting a finger.  \n\nOver time, you’ll notice your inbox feels lighter, your response times improve, and your focus shifts back to real work rather than inbox triage.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Gmail Trigger** catches every new incoming email.  \n2. **AI Categorizer** decides whether the message should be:  \n   - **Reply** (safe to answer immediately),  \n   - **Draft** (needs your review),  \n   - **Nothing** (ignore).  \n3. **AI Writer** generates either a ready-to-send reply or a draft that feels natural and professional.  \n4. **Gmail Integration** then either sends, drafts, or ignores, based on the AI’s decision.  \n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Customer support**: Quick replies for common questions, while important issues get drafted for your review.  \n- **Freelancers & solopreneurs**: Keep clients happy with fast replies, but stay safe on sensitive topics.  \n- **Personal inbox management**: Lighten the load of newsletters, promotions, and low-value emails.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- An **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud).  \n- A **Gmail account** connected via OAuth2 in n8n.  \n- **Google Gemini API access** for AI categorization and drafting.  \n- Basic familiarity with n8n workflows and how to connect credentials.  \n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Will this replace my judgment entirely?**  \nNo. It only automates what’s safe. Complex or sensitive emails are always drafted for you to review.  \n\n**Q: Can I customize how the AI writes replies?**  \nYes. You can adjust the prompt inside the workflow to match your own style and tone.  \n\n**Q: What happens if the AI misclassifies an email?**  \nAt worst, you’ll get a draft instead of an auto-reply. You’ll never lose control over sensitive communication.  \n\n**Q: Does this cost extra to run?**  \nUsing Gmail via n8n is free, but you’ll need Google Gemini API access, which may come with its own usage limits or costs.  \n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Important Note**:  \nThis workflow comes with **no support**. You need to be comfortable working with n8n, credentials, and AI nodes on your own. It’s provided as-is for the community to experiment with and adapt.  \n\n---\n\nStart using it, and you’ll quickly see how much lighter your inbox feels.\n",
