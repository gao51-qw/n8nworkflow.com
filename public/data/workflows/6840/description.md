## 👤 Who’s it for

- Recruiters & Talent Acquisition Specialists  
- Event Teams collecting business cards  
- Admins who manage contact databases manually  

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

This workflow automates the extraction of contact details from uploaded name card (business card) images and stores them in a structured Google Sheet for easy tracking and follow-up.

### Workflow Steps:
1. User uploads one or more name card images through a web form.
2. The uploaded files are saved to a Google Drive folder for archiving.
3. A smart AI agent (with OCR and GPT capabilities) scans each image and extracts relevant contact data into structured JSON format.
4. Data is transformed, cleaned (e.g., removing `+` from phone numbers), and filtered.
5. Valid contacts are appended to a Google Sheet for central tracking and future use.

## 🛠 How to set up

1. **Create a Form**  
   - Allow file upload (JPG/PNG format).
   - Label it as “Name Card Uploader” with a clear description.

2. **Upload to Google Drive**  
   - Use the Google Drive node to store uploaded images.

3. **Configure Smart Agent**  
   - Use GPT-4o or similar model with OCR capability.
   - Apply a structured output parser to extract contact fields like name, phone, email, company, etc.

4. **Transform Data**  
   - Use the Code node to clean and structure contact info.
   - Strip out unwanted characters from phone numbers (e.g., `+`).

5. **Filter Invalid Records**  
   - Remove entries with no meaningful contact data.

6. **Append to Google Sheets**  
   - Use the Google Sheets node with "Append Sheet Row".
   - Map fields to columns like Name, Phone, Email, etc.

## ✅ Requirements

- n8n workflow environment  
- Google Drive integration (for file storage)  
- Google Sheets integration (for storing contacts)  
- GPT-4o or any image-capable LLM  
- Clear name card images (PNG/JPG, readable text)  
- (Optional) Slack/email integration for notifications

## 🧩 How to customize the workflow

- **CRM Sync**: Connect to platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zoho.  
- **Validation Logic**: Ensure records contain key fields like name or email before writing.  
- **Uploader Info**: Attach submitter metadata to each contact record.  
- **Language Adaptation**: Adjust extracted field labels/output to target your preferred language.  
- **Batch Upload**: Handle multiple cards in a single image or multiple uploads in one go.
