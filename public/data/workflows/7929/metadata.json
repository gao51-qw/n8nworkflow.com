  "description": "# 🚀 B2B Outreach Automation: Email Finder & Sequence Writer — n8n Template\n\nThis template is built for founders, SDR teams, and agencies who prospect on LinkedIn and want the entire cold-outreach pipeline automated. It turns a simple LinkedIn profile URL into a verified email and a fully personalized 5-step email sequence—then logs everything to Google Sheets for tracking and iteration.\n\nNo more switching tools, copying data, or writing follow-ups by hand.  \n**One run = research → verified email → 1 intro + 4 follow-ups → clean sheet update.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Workflow Capabilities\n- **LinkedIn → Verified Email**: Finds professional emails from LinkedIn profiles using AnyMailFinder, including `email_status` (e.g., verified/catch-all).  \n- **Contextual Research**: Pulls company insights with Perplexity and scrapes LinkedIn profile details via Apify for richer personalization.  \n- **AI Email Writing**: Generates 1 personalized intro email + 4 strategic follow-ups with subject lines using OpenAI; enforces a strict JSON structure to avoid messy output.  \n- **Google Sheets CRM**: Writes all results back to your sheet (emails, names, titles, subjects, bodies, status).  \n- **Safe & Scalable**: Processes leads in batches, with optional wait/rate-limits to respect APIs; supports append-or-update logic to prevent duplicates.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n1. **Read** new leads from Google Sheets (rows where `Email status` is empty).  \n2. **Discover** the contact’s email via AnyMailFinder using the LinkedIn URL.  \n3. **Enrich** with Perplexity company research + Apify LinkedIn scrape; clean profile data into a concise summary.  \n4. **Generate** a complete sequence (intro + 4 follow-ups) via OpenAI with your base template and service description.  \n6. **Write Back** to Google Sheets: subjects, bodies, verified email, status, and core fields (Full Name, Title, Company).  \n7. **Loop** to the next profile.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Easy Setup\n- Connect APIs (**Google Sheets, OpenAI, AnyMailFinder, Apify, Perplexity**).  \n- Add your keys & paste your email template.  \n- Fill the Google Sheet, run a test, then scale.  \n\n---\n\n\n\n## 🎁 What You Get\n- Production-ready **n8n workflow (JSON)** for Cloud or Self-Hosted.  \n- Pre-mapped **Google Sheet structure**.  \n- Step-by-step setup notes inside **Sticky Notes**.  \n- **10 bonus cold email templates** to swap into the base prompt.  \n",
