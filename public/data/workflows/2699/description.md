**How it works:**

- Send notes from Obsidian via Webhook to start the audio conversion
- OpenAI converts your text to natural-sounding audio and generates episode descriptions
- Audio files are stored in Cloudinary and automatically attached to your notes in Obsidian
- A professional podcast feed is generated, compatible with all major podcast platforms (Apple, Spotify, Google)

**Set up steps:**

- Install and configure the [Post Webhook Plugin](https://github.com/Masterb1234/obsidian-post-webhook/) in Obsidian
- Set up Custom Auth credentials in n8n for Cloudinary using the following JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "Cloudinary API",
  "type": "httpHeaderAuth",
  "authParameter": {
    "type": "header",
    "key": "Authorization",
    "value": "Basic {{Buffer.from('your_api_key:your_api_secret').toString('base64')}}"
  }
}
```

- Configure podcast feed metadata (title, author, cover image, etc.)

Note: The second flow is a generic Podcast Feed module that can be reused in any '[...]-to-Podcast' workflow. It generates a standard RSS feed from Google Sheets data and podcast metadata, making it compatible with all major podcast platforms.
