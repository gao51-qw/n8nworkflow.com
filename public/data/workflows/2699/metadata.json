  "description": "**How it works:**\n\n- Send notes from Obsidian via Webhook to start the audio conversion\n- OpenAI converts your text to natural-sounding audio and generates episode descriptions\n- Audio files are stored in Cloudinary and automatically attached to your notes in Obsidian\n- A professional podcast feed is generated, compatible with all major podcast platforms (Apple, Spotify, Google)\n\n**Set up steps:**\n\n- Install and configure the [Post Webhook Plugin](https://github.com/Masterb1234/obsidian-post-webhook/) in Obsidian\n- Set up Custom Auth credentials in n8n for Cloudinary using the following JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Cloudinary API\",\n  \"type\": \"httpHeaderAuth\",\n  \"authParameter\": {\n    \"type\": \"header\",\n    \"key\": \"Authorization\",\n    \"value\": \"Basic {{Buffer.from('your_api_key:your_api_secret').toString('base64')}}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Configure podcast feed metadata (title, author, cover image, etc.)\n\nNote: The second flow is a generic Podcast Feed module that can be reused in any '[...]-to-Podcast' workflow. It generates a standard RSS feed from Google Sheets data and podcast metadata, making it compatible with all major podcast platforms.",
