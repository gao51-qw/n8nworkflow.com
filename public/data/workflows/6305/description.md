# Salesforce to S3 File Migration & Cleanup

Automate archiving old Salesforce files to Amazon S3, log them back in Salesforce, and free up org storage — all from a scheduled n8n workflow.

---

## 🔧 How It Works (High-Level)

1. **Schedule Trigger** kicks off (e.g., daily).  
2. **Query Salesforce** for `ContentDocument` records older than 365 days.  
3. **Loop Each File** → download binary via REST.  
4. **Upload to S3** with the original filename.  
5. **Lookup Links** (`ContentDocumentLink`) to keep the parent record reference.  
6. **Filter Out Users** (ignore `LinkedEntityId` starting with `005`).  
7. **Create `S3_File__c`** record in Salesforce for traceability.  
8. **Delete Original File** from Salesforce to reclaim storage.  
9. **Notify via Slack** when the batch is done.

## 🚀 Set Up Steps (Time: ~45–90 mins)

1. **Import n8n Workflow JSON** and wire up credentials (Salesforce OAuth2, AWS S3, Slack).  
2. **Install Salesforce Unmanaged Package** (Custom Object `S3_File__c`, Apex controller, LWC, settings).  
3. **Fill `S3Settings__c`** (bucket, region, keys, expiry) or swap to Named Credentials.  
4. **Test with a Sandbox Batch** (e.g., small date range) and verify upload/delete.  
5. **Schedule & Monitor** (tweak interval, Slack channel).
