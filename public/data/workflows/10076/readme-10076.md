# Automate Dutch Public Procurement Data Collection with TenderNed

> # TenderNed Public Procurement

## What This Workflow Does

This workflow automates the collection of public procurement data from TenderNed (the official Dutch tender platform). It:

1. **Fetches** the latest tender publications from the TenderNed API
2. **Retrieves** detailed information in both XML and JSON formats for each tender
3. **Parses** and extracts key information like organization names, titles, descriptions, and reference numbers
4. **Filters** results based on your custom criteria
5. **Stores** the data in a database for easy querying and analysis


## Setup Instructions
This template comes with sticky notes providing step-by-step instructions in Dutch and various query options you can customize.

### Prerequisites

1. **TenderNed API Access** - Register at [TenderNed](https://www.tenderned.nl/) for API credentials

### Configuration Steps

1. **Set up TenderNed credentials:**
   - Add HTTP Basic Auth credentials with your TenderNed API username and password
   - Apply these credentials to the three HTTP Request nodes:
     - "Tenderned Publicaties"
     - "Haal XML Details"
     - "Haal JSON Details"

2. **Customize filters:**
   - Modify the "Filter op ..." node to match your specific requirements
   - Examples: specific organizations, contract values, regions, etc.


## How It Works

### Step 1: Trigger
The workflow can be triggered either manually for testing or automatically on a daily schedule.

### Step 2: Fetch Publications
Makes an API call to TenderNed to retrieve a list of recent publications (up to 100 per request).

### Step 3: Process & Split
Extracts the tender array from the response and splits it into individual items for processing.

### Step 4: Fetch Details
For each tender, the workflow makes two parallel API calls:
- **XML endpoint** - Retrieves the complete tender documentation in XML format
- **JSON endpoint** - Fetches metadata including reference numbers and keywords

### Step 5: Parse & Merge
Parses the XML data and merges it with the JSON metadata and batch information into a single data structure.

### Step 6: Extract Fields
Maps the raw API data to clean, structured fields including:
- Publication ID and date
- Organization name
- Tender title and description
- Reference numbers (kenmerk, TED number)

### Step 7: Filter
Applies your custom filter criteria to focus on relevant tenders only.

### Step 8: Store
Inserts the processed data into your database for storage and future analysis.

## Customization Tips

### Modify API Parameters
In the "Tenderned Publicaties" node, you can adjust:
- `offset`: Starting position for pagination
- `size`: Number of results per request (max 100)
- Add query parameters for date ranges, status filters, etc.

### Add More Fields
Extend the "Splits Alle Velden" node to extract additional fields from the XML/JSON data, such as:
- Contract value estimates
- Deadline dates
- CPV codes (procurement classification)
- Contact information

### Integrate Notifications
Add a Slack, Email, or Discord node after the filter to get notified about new matching tenders.

### Incremental Updates
Modify the workflow to only fetch new tenders by:
1. Storing the last execution timestamp
2. Adding date filters to the API query
3. Only processing publications newer than the last run

## Troubleshooting

**No data returned?**
- Verify your TenderNed API credentials are correct
- Check that you have setup youre filter proper
