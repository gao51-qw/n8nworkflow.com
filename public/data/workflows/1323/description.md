This workflow automatically does the following:
- Scrapes comments and likes from a LinkedIn post.
- Adds contact data (nominative and verified email address,  gender, standardized first name and last name, all legal company information).
- Adds these contacts to Airtable.
- Sends an ultra-personalized cold email sequence.
- Sends a Linkedin invitation after the cold email sending.
- Pushes all contacts to HubSpot.

## Prerequisites

- A Phantombuster account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/phantombuster/)
- A Lemlist account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/lemlist/)
- A Dropcontact account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/dropcontact/)
- A HubSpot account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/hubspot/)

## How it works

- [Cron node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cron/) executes the workflow every hour.
- [Phantombuster node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.phantombuster/) **(Launch agent)** launches the "LinkedIn Post Likers" phantom and the "LinkedIn Post Commenters" phantom. Note that you have to create these phantoms before setting your workflow automation.
- **Phantombuster node (Get Output agent)** gets results from the previous phantoms.
- [Dropcontact node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.dropcontact/) fetches the new contact information and returns the data of the person and the company associated with the email address, job function, and all legal information.
- [Airtable node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) **(List)** lists all the records in the Contacts table.
- [IF node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) routes the workflow based on whether a contact is in Airtable.
- [Set node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) sets the required data for the following nodes.
- **Airtable node (Update)** updates the record's name.
- **Airtable node (Append)** creates a record if the account doesn't exist yet.
- [Lemlist node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.lemlist/) adds a contact to an existing campaign.
- **Phantombuster node (Launch agent)** launches the "LinkedIn Network Booster" phantom. Note that you have to create these phantoms before setting your automation.
- [Hubspot node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/) creates or updates the contacts in the HubSpot CRM.
