## How it Works.

The workflow runs automatically every day and collects analytics data for both today and yesterday. It cleans and standardizes both datasets in the same way so they are easy to compare. After that, it measures how performance has changed from one day to the next and interprets those changes to understand trends and context. Once all calculations are finished, the AI creates a clear, easy-to-read summary of what happened. This summary is then formatted and sent through the required communication channels, while the final data is saved for tracking over time and for creating follow-up tasks if needed.

## Key Features:
- Trigger runs once per day recommended (11: 57 PM).
- Fetch seperate data for today and yesterday in node.
- Compare the two days data and highlight if traffic is less
- Add the trend `lowTraffic` for low traffic identification.
- Using GPT-4 Mini for human readable summary to suit different communication channels.
- Sending report to WhatsApp / Email
- Stored the final structure data to Google Sheet for future analytics and historical record
