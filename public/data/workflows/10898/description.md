**How the n8n OWASP Scanner Works & How to Set It Up**

**How It Works (Simple Flow):**
- **1. Input**: Enter target URL + endpoint (e.g., `https://example.com`, `/login`)
- **2. Scan**: This workflow executes 5 parallel HTTP tests (Headers, Cookies, CORS, HTTPS, Methods)
- **3. Analyze**: Pure JS logic checks OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard) rules (no external tools)
- **4. Merge**: Combines all findings into one Markdown report
- **5. Output**: Auto-generates + downloads `scan-2025-11-16_210900.md`** (example filename)
- **6. Email:** (Optional) Forward the report to an email address using Gmail.
