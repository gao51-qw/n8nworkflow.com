This workflow enables seamless, privacy-first capture of meeting notes from your iPhone. It pairs with an [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f97a1f2ad52648e5998caf321a482890) that leverages **Apple’s on-device transcription** from the Voice Memos app and optionally passes the output to **ChatGPT or a local AI model** for summarization.

### Who it's for

- Anyone who wants fast, secure note capture on iOS
- Professionals (e.g., lawyers, therapists) who require **on-device processing** for privacy
- Obsidian users who want to sync mobile notes via Google Drive

### What it does

1. You record a voice memo in the iOS Voice Memos app.
2. The Shortcut transcribes it locally (no API or cloud involved).
3. Optionally, a summarization step is done via ChatGPT or a replaceable local model.
4. The data is sent to an n8n webhook, where it’s converted into a `.md` file.
5. The Markdown file is uploaded to a Google Drive folder synced with your Obsidian vault.

### Key Benefits

- 🧠 Keeps your meeting notes private — no cloud APIs required
- 🗃️ Easily searchable in Obsidian as structured Markdown files
- 🛠️ Fully local if you swap out ChatGPT for a local model (can be less stable)

### Limitations

- Transcriptions longer than **~1 hour** may fail or produce unstable results.
- Some setup required to replace ChatGPT with a local model in the Shortcut.

### Setup

- Install and configure the [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f97a1f2ad52648e5998caf321a482890)
- Replace the ChatGPT step in the Shortcut if you need full local-only processing
- Point the webhook in the Shortcut to your n8n instance
- Make sure your Obsidian vault is synced with the Google Drive folder used in the workflow
- Update any of the prompts in the iOS shortcut to ensure its personalized. 

&gt; ⚡ Pro Tip: Use a Set node early on to clearly define the `filename`, `title`, and `text` so it's easier to modify this for other note types (e.g., journals, therapy sessions, etc.)
