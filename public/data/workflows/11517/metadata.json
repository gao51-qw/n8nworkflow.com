  "description": "# Champion Migration Tracker\n\nAutomatically detect when your champion contacts change companies and respond with intelligent, personalized AI outreach before your competitors do.\n\n## THE PROBLEM\n\nWhen champions move to new companies, sales teams lose track and miss high-value opportunities. Manual LinkedIn monitoring doesn't scale, and by the time you notice, the relationship has gone cold.\n\n## THE SOLUTION\n\nThis workflow automates champion migration tracking end-to-end, combining Explorium's data intelligence with Claude AI agents to maintain relationships and prioritize opportunities.\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\n### 1. Automated Job Change Detection\n- Uses Explorium person enrichment to detect when champions move companies\n- Eliminates manual LinkedIn monitoring\n- Triggers immediately when employment changes\n\n### 2. Intelligent Company Enrichment\n- Enriches new companies with Explorium data: firmographics, funding, tech stack, hiring velocity\n- Checks if company already exists in your CRM (Customer vs Prospect)\n- Identifies open opportunities and account owners\n\n### 3. Multi-Dimensional Opportunity Scoring (0-100)\n- **ICP Fit (40%)**: Company size, funding stage, revenue, tech stack alignment\n- **Relationship Strength (40%)**: Past deals influenced, relationship warmth, CRM status\n- **Timing (20%)**: Days at new company, recent funding/acquisition signals\n- Results in Hot/Warm/Cold priority classification\n\n### 4. Smart Routing by Context\n- **Customers**: Notify account manager with congratulations message\n- **Hot Prospects (75+ score)**: Draft detailed strategic outreach for rep review\n\n### 5. AI-Powered Personalization\n- Claude AI agents generate contextually relevant emails\n- References past relationship, deals influenced, and company intelligence\n- Adapts tone and content based on opportunity priority and CRM status\n\n## DEMO SETUP (Google Sheets)\n\nThis demo uses Google Sheets for simplicity. **For production use, replace with your actual CRM:**\n- Salesforce\n- HubSpot\n- Pipedrive\n- Any CRM with n8n integration\n\n### Important Fields to Consider:\n\n**Champions:**\n- `champion_id`, `name`, `email`, `company`, `title`, `last_checked_date`\n- `relationship_strength` (Hot/Warm/Cold), `last_contact_date`, `deals_influenced`\n- `relationship_notes`, `isChampion` (TRUE/FALSE), `linkedin_url`, `explorium_prospect_id`\n\n**Companies:**\n- `company_ID`, `companyName`, `domain`, `relationship_type` (Customer/Prospect/None)\n- `open_opportunity` (TRUE/FALSE), `opportunity_stage`, `account_owner`, `account_owner_email`\n- `contractValue`, `notes`, `ExploriumBusinessID`\n\n## REQUIRED CREDENTIALS\n\n1. **Anthropic API Key** - Powers Claude AI agents for email generation\n2. **Explorium API Key** - Provides person and company enrichment data\n3. **Google Sheets** or **Your CRM** (production) - Data source and logging\n\n## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. **Connect Credentials** in n8n Settings → Credentials\n2. **Update Data Sources**: Replace Google Sheets nodes with your CRM nodes (or create demo sheets with structure above)\n3. **Configure Scoring**: Adjust ICP scoring criteria in \"Score Company\" node to match your ideal customer profile\n4. **Test with Sample Data**: Run with 2-3 test champions to verify routing and email generation\n5. **Schedule Trigger**: Set to run daily or weekly based on your needs\n\n## CUSTOMIZATION TIPS\n\n**Scoring Weights**: Adjust the 40/40/20 weighting in the scoring node to prioritize what matters most to your business\n\n**Tech Stack Matching**: Update the `relevantTech` array with tools your champions likely use\n\n**Email Tone**: Modify Claude prompts to match your brand voice (formal, casual, technical, etc.)\n\n**Routing Logic**: Add additional branches for specific scenarios (e.g., churned customers, enterprise accounts)\n\n**Agentic Experience: Consider adding an agent that sends the email for Cold prospects automatically.\n\n**Integrations**: Add Slack notifications, CRM updates, or calendar booking links to the output\n\n## BUSINESS VALUE\n\n- **Prevent Revenue Leakage**: Never lose track of champion relationships\n- **Prioritize Intelligently**: Focus on opportunities with highest potential\n- **Scale Relationship Building**: Automate what used to require manual effort\n- **Act Before Competitors**: Reach out while champions are still settling into new roles\n- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Quantifiable scores replace gut feelings\n\n## USE CASES\n\n- **Sales Teams**: Re-engage champions at new prospect companies\n- **Customer Success**: Track champions who move to existing accounts\n- **Account-Based Marketing**: Identify high-fit accounts through champion networks\n- **Revenue Operations**: Automate champion tracking at scale\n\n## NOTES\n\n- **Production Recommendation**: Replace Google Sheets with your production CRM for real-time data\n- **Privacy**: All API keys are credential-referenced (not hardcoded) for security\n- **Explorium Credits**: Person + company enrichment uses ~2-3 credits per champion",
