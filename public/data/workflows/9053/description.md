## How it works
Automatically imports company data from Google Sheets into Salesforce while intelligently preventing duplicate accounts. The workflow searches for existing companies, creates new accounts only when needed, and ensures all contact information is properly associated.

Key features:
- Smart duplicate detection by company name matching
- Dual processing paths for new vs existing companies  
- Automatic contact creation and association
- Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- Professional sectional documentation with setup guides

**Estimated setup time:** 15-30 minutes  
**Processing time:** 15-45 seconds per company
