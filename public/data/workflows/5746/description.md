This template can be used to **generate research ideas from PDF scientific papers**  based on the **content gaps** found in text using the **[InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com)** GraphRAG knowledge graph representation.

Simply **upload several PDF files** (research papers, corporate or market reports, etc) and the template will **generate a research question**, which will then be **sent as an AI prompt** to the **InfraNodus GraphRAG** system that will extract the answer from the documents.

As a result, you **find the gap in a collection of research papers and bridge it in a few seconds** . 

The template is **useful for:**

- advancing scientific research
- generating AI prompts that drive research further
- finding the right questions to ask to bridge blind spots in a research field
- avoiding the generic bias of LLM models and focusing on what's important in your particular context



## Using Content Gaps for Generating Research Questions

Knowledge graphs represent any text as a network: the main concepts are the nodes, their co-occurrences are the connections between them. 

Based on this representation, we build a graph and apply network science metrics to rank the most important nodes (concepts) that serve as the crossroads of meaning and also the main topical clusters that they connect. 

Naturally, some of the clusters will be disconnected and will have gaps between them. These are the topics (groups of concepts) that exist in this context (the documents you uploaded) but that are not very well connected. 

Addressing those gaps can help you see which groups of concepts you could connect with your own ideas. This is exactly what [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) does: builds the structure, finds the gaps, then uses the built-in AI to generate research questions that bridge those gaps.

## How it works

1) Step 1: First, you **upload your PDF files** using an online web form, which you can run from n8n or even make publicly available. 

2) Steps 2-4: The documents are processed using the Code and PDF to Text nodes to **extract plain text** from them.

3) Step 5: This text is then sent to the **InfraNodus GraphRAG** node that creates a knowledge graph, identifies **structural gaps** in this graph, and then uses built-in AI to **research questions, which are then used as AI prompts**.

4) Step 6: The research questino is sent to the **InfraNodus GraphRAG** system that represents the PDF documents you submitted as a knowledge graph and then uses the research question generated to come up with an answer based on the content you uploaded.

4) Step 7: The ideas are then **shown to the user** in the same web form. 

Optionally, you can derive the answers from a different set of papers, so the question is generated from one batch, but the answer is generated from another.

## How to use

You need an [InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) to use this workflow. 

- Create an InfraNodus account
- Get the API key at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access) and create a Bearer authorization key.
- Add this key into the InfraNodus GraphRAG HTTP node(s) you use in this workflow.
- You do not need any OpenAI keys for this to work.

Optionally, you can change the settings in the Step 4 of this workflow and enforce it to always use the biggest gap it identifies.


## Requirements

- An [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) account and API key

Note: OpenAI key is not required. You will have direct access to the InfraNodus AI with the API key.



## Customizing this workflow

You can use this same workflow with a Telegram bot or Slack (to be notified of the summaries and ideas). 

You can also hook up automated social media content creation workflows in the end of this template, so you can generate posts that are relevant (covering the important topics in your niche) but also novel (because they connect them in a new way).
