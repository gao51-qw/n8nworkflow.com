  "description": "### Main Workflow “AI Nextcloud”\n\n* **Entry point**: A public chat-trigger greets the user; every incoming chat message starts the flow.\n* **AI agent**: A LangChain agent (“AI Nextcloud”) uses the configured OpenAI model plus short-term memory to continue the dialogue in context.\n* **Purpose**: Answers questions about files stored in a Nextcloud folder. The user simply includes the folder path in their question.\n* **Tool integration**: Calls the sub-workflow “Nextcloud Tool” whenever it needs to read files and pass their text back to the AI.\n\n---\n\n### Sub-Workflow “Nextcloud Tool”\n\n1. **Invocation**: Triggered by other workflows with the input parameter `path` (folder path).\n2. **File listing**: Retrieves every file in the specified folder via the Nextcloud API.\n3. **Filter**: Allows only readable formats (PDF, Markdown, DOCX).\n4. **Download & text extraction**\n\n   * **PDF** → Text via *Extract From File*\n   * **Markdown** → Raw text\n   * **DOCX** → Text via community node *word2text*\n5. **Aggregation**: Combines all extracted text into a single `output` field and returns it.\n\n&gt; **Outcome**: Each call yields the plain content of every supported file in a Nextcloud folder—providing rich context for the AI agent to answer user questions accurately.\n",
