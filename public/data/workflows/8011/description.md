## 📄 What this workflow does
This workflow transforms your n8n instance into a fully automated AI sales assistant for WooCommerce stores. It detects customer intent from chat, searches products, answers FAQs, generates Stripe payment links, captures leads into your CRM, and even escalates to human support when needed. It provides smooth conversational memory and syncs with your knowledge base to ensure accurate, human-like responses.

## 👤 Who is this for
- WooCommerce store owners who want to automate customer support and sales.
- Sales and marketing teams looking to scale personalized product recommendations.
- E-commerce managers who want to reduce manual chat handling.
- Anyone aiming to integrate AI assistants with payments, CRM, and FAQs.


## ✅ Requirements
- WooCommerce account with API access.
- Qdrant vector store (for FAQ and RAG retrieval).
- OpenAI/Gemini API credentials (for intent detection + message generation).
- Google Drive account (to sync and update knowledge base docs).
- Stripe account (to generate instant payment links).
- CRM account (HubSpot, Pipedrive, etc.) if lead capture is required.
- Telegram account for optional human escalation.

## ⚙️ How to set up
