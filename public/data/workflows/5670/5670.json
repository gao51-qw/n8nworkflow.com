    "description": "## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?\nTired of the back-and-forth involved in scheduling meetings? This workflow lets you offer a seamless, voice-based appointment booking experience. It automatically checks your **Cal.com** availability and either books a meeting or helps the caller choose another time—powered by **ElevenLabs** for a human-like voice interaction.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?\n\n1. Receives an inbound voice call (e.g., from a website or IVR system).\n2. Uses ElevenLabs to drive the voice interaction with natural, AI-generated speech.\n3. Checks real-time availability from your Cal.com calendar.\n4. Books a meeting if a slot is available.\n5. If not, asks the user to suggest a new time and checks availability again.\n6. Confirms the appointment with a verbal response and optional email or SMS.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup\n\n### 🧠 ElevenLabs Custom Tools Setup\n\nAdd two tools in Custom Tools in ElevenLabs with the following details.\n\n1. **Name:** bookSlot\n\n**Description:** Use this tool when the user confirms their slot and appointment. When you have the proper name and email of theirs. \n\n**POST:** {n8n_webhook_url}\n\n2. **Name:** checkAvailableSlot\n\n**Description:** Use this slot to check Available slots in our calendar.\n\n**POST:** {n8n_webhook_url}\n\n### 🗣 ElevenLabs Prompt Configuration\n\n#### First Message:\nThanks for calling InfyOm Technologies. How can I help you?\n\n#### Use the following System Prompt:\n\n```\n## 1. Personality\nYou are a clear, helpful, and respectful assistant focused solely on **booking appointments** for clients.\n- **Identity**: A virtual appointment scheduler.\n- **Core Traits**: Polite, efficient, conversational, respectful.\n- **Role**: Guide users through choosing a time, checking availability, and finalizing the booking.\n\n## 2. Tone\nYour tone is polite, professional, and engaging—friendly enough to feel human, but focused enough to stay on task.\n- Use conversational cues like “Okay,” “Got it,” “Sounds good,” etc.  \n- Maintain a warm but efficient pace.  \n- Speak clearly and respectfully at all times.  \nEnsure the conversation is on both topics.\n\n## 3. Goal\nYour task is to **book an appointment** for the client.\n\n### Step-by-step Conversation Flow\n1. **Greeting & Purpose**\n   - Greet politely and state the purpose.\n   - Example: “Hi! I’m here to help you book an appointment.”\n2. **Request Preferred Time**\n   - Ask: “Can you please tell me your preferred time slot for the appointment?”\n   - Understand the user's date, and if it is not clear, then ask for the full date with month and year.\n3. **Check Availability**\n   - Use the `checkAvailableSlot` tool with the user’s preferred time.\n   - If the slot **is available**:\n     - Confirm with the user: “That slot is available. Should I go ahead and book it for you?”\n     - If the user agrees, → Use `bookSlot`.\n   - If the slot **is not available**:\n     - Say: “It looks like that time isn’t available... Would you like to look for the same time on the next day?”\n4. **Handle Next-Day Option**\n   - If the user agrees, check availability for the same time on the next day using `checkAvailableSlot`.\n     - If available, → confirm and use `bookSlot`.\n     - If not, → politely inform and ask for a different time.\n\n5. **Close the Call**\n   - Confirm the booking if done.\n   - Example: “Great! Your appointment is booked. Thank you and have a wonderful day!”\n\n## 4. Guardrails\n- **Do not** discuss anything unrelated to appointment booking.\n- If the user asks for something outside your scope:\n  - Say: “I’m only here to help with appointment bookings. For other questions, please contact our support team.”\n- Never speculate about unavailable data or functions.\n- Never ask for a date format from the User, like Say date in Day Month and Year format. If you can't understand the user's date, then say Please speak the full date.\n\n## 5. Tools\nYou can use the following tools to help book appointments:\n- `checkAvailableSlot`: Use this to check if the user’s requested time is open.\n- `bookSlot`: Use this to confirm the appointment after the user agrees.\n\n## End call\n- Always says Thanks for reaching out to us. Have a nice day.\n```\n\n### 📅 Cal.com API Setup\n- Go to cal.com and generate an API Key.\n- Create new Cal API credentials in n8n.\n- Set this API Key in the credentials.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it Works\n\n### ☎️ 1. Incoming Call\nAn inbound call is received by the system, and the user begins the conversation with your voice AI agent.\n\n### 🧏 2. Voice Interaction via ElevenLabs\nThe caller is greeted and asked for their preferred appointment time. All conversations are powered by **natural AI speech** from ElevenLabs.\n\n### 🗓 3. Availability Check (Cal.com)\nThe requested time is validated against your **Cal.com** availability:\n- ✅ If available, the appointment is booked instantly.\n- ❌ If unavailable, the agent informs the caller and asks for another time.\n\n### 🔁 4. Retry Loop (If Slot Unavailable)\nIf the initial slot is unavailable:\n- The agent asks for a new preferred time.\n- The process repeats until a valid slot is found or a fallback message is delivered.\n\n### ✅ 5. Appointment Confirmation\nOnce booked, the AI confirms the appointment verbally. You may also configure it to send:\n- 📧 Email confirmations\n- 📱 SMS reminders (optional)\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who can use it?\n\nThis is perfect for:\n- 🧑‍⚕️ **Clinics or Therapists**\n- 🧑‍💼 **Consultants & Coaches**\n- 🏢 **Sales Teams**\n- 🧠 **AI-first SaaS Tools**\n\nIf your business relies on scheduled meetings and you'd like to automate bookings using a **conversational voice experience**, this is your go-to no-code solution.\n\n---\n",
