## ✨ What It Does

**Mello** is a Claude-powered Slack assistant that helps you stay on top of unread messages across all your channels.

It:
- Summarizes conversations contextually using Claude AI.
- Generates reply suggestions and sends them as private (ephemeral) Slack messages.
- Lets you respond instantly with one-click AI-suggested replies.

Perfect for busy teams, founders, and anyone looking to reduce Slack noise and save hours each week.
