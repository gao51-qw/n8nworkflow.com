## 📘 Description
This workflow automates the entire process of taking a raw user-submitted script, rewriting it into a polished HeyGen-ready narration, generating a full avatar video, handling all processing checks, retrieving the final MP4, uploading it to Google Drive, and notifying the user through email and Slack. It turns an unstructured script into a complete, ready-to-share video package without any manual intervention.
The system rewrites scripts into structured sections (intro → narration sections → closing), ensures the final narration fits HeyGen’s free-tier limits, submits the script to HeyGen’s video API, initiates a polling loop until the video is fully rendered, downloads the finished file, uploads it to Drive with metadata, and generates clean notification messages containing the file links. Errors at any point trigger automated Slack alerts for debugging.
This workflow replaces manual rewriting, video rendering, download/upload, and team communication—providing a fully-managed script-to-video pipeline.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)
🟢 Receive Script Request via Webhook
 Captures the raw script payload submitted by the user.
🧹 Parse Incoming Script Payload
 Converts stringified JSON body into structured data for processing.
✍️ Rewrite & Structure Video Script Using AI
 Transforms the raw script into:
 • Video title
 • Intro
 • Multiple sections (title + narration)
 • Closing
 • Combined full_script optimized for HeyGen’s ~300–350 word limit
 Ensures natural, human narration with smooth transitions.
🧠 Script Writing Memory + LLM Engine
 Maintains writing consistency and uses GPT-4.1-mini to generate polished narration.
🧪 Validate Structured Script Output
 Enforces strict JSON schema for titles, sections, closing, and full_script.
🎞️ Submit Video Generation Request to HeyGen
 Sends structured script to HeyGen API with avatar, voice, and background settings for 1280×720 export.
⏳ Wait Before Polling Loop
 Initial delay before the first status check.
📡 Check HeyGen Video Status
 Queries the HeyGen API to check progress of the video generation.
⏳ Wait Before Rechecking
 Adds timed spacing between repeated polls.
🔍 Evaluate Video Completion
 If status = completed → proceed
 If still processing → loop back to polling sequence
