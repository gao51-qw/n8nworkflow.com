# Create evergreen content with GitHub dynamic images & URL redirects

> **Transform static digital assets into dynamic, self-updating powerhouses that stay relevant for years to come!**

This workflow solves a common problem: once you publish forms, emails, or templates, their content becomes frozen in time. Users discovering them months later see outdated information, missed opportunities, and stale offers.

Stop losing opportunities to stale content – make your digital assets work harder and stay fresher, automatically!

**Here's how it works:**
- 🔗 **Stable embed links** mean your original assets never need updating
- 🔄 **Dynamic URL redirects** that automatically point to the latest pages
- 🖼️ **Auto-updating images** that showcase fresh offers or content
- 📅 **Scheduled updates** keep everything current without manual intervention

**Perfect for:**
- Workflow sticky notes that become evergreen marketing billboards
- Registration forms with current promotions
- Email signatures with latest offers  
- Website banners that stay seasonally relevant
- Any digital asset you want to "future-proof"

**The magic:** Set it up once, embed the stable URLs/images in your content, then forget about it. Years later, users will still see fresh, as current information automatically pulled from your workflow.

**Requirements:** Free accounts with [GitHub](https://github.com/) (image storage) and [shorten.rest ](https://shorten.rest/) (URL redirects).

Both can be swapped for your preferred services.
