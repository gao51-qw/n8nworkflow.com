  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow consolidates data from five different systems — Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and Google Analytics — into a single master Google Sheet. It runs on a scheduled trigger three times a week. Each dataset is tagged with a unique source identifier before merging, ensuring data traceability. Finally, the merged dataset is cleaned, standardized, and written into the output Google Sheet for reporting and analysis.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**1. Trigger the workflow**  \n- **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow at set weekly intervals.  \n\n**2. Collect data from sources**  \n- **Google Sheets Source** – Retrieves records from a specific sheet.  \n- **PostgreSQL Source** – Extracts customer data from the database.  \n- **MongoDB Source** – Pulls documents from the defined collection.  \n- **Microsoft SQL Server** – Executes a SQL query and returns results.  \n- **Google Analytics** – Captures user activity and engagement metrics.  \n\n**3. Tag each dataset**  \n- **Add Sheets Source ID** – Marks data from Google Sheets.  \n- **Add PostgreSQL Source ID** – Marks data from PostgreSQL.  \n- **Add MongoDB Source ID** – Marks data from MongoDB.  \n- **Add SQL Server Source ID** – Marks data from SQL Server.  \n- **Add Analytics Source ID** – Marks data from Google Analytics.  \n\n**4. Merge and process**  \n- **Merge** – Combines all tagged datasets into a single structure.  \n- **Process Merged Data** – Cleans, aligns schemas, and standardizes key fields.  \n\n**5. Store consolidated output**  \n- **Final Google Sheet** – Appends or updates the master sheet with the processed data.  \n\n## Why use this?\n\n- Centralizes multiple data sources into a single, consistent dataset.  \n- Ensures data traceability by tagging each source.  \n- Reduces manual effort in data cleaning and consolidation.  \n- Provides a reliable reporting hub for business analysis.  \n- Enables scheduled, automated updates for up-to-date visibility.  \n",
