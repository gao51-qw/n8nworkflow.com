  "description": "# Daily Weather Reports with OpenWeather API, Google Sheets, and Gmail\n\nThis workflow fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API, stores it in a Google Sheet, formats it into a beautifully styled HTML report and emails it to recipients automatically every day at 10:00 AM. It helps teams track and monitor daily weather trends and optionally correlate them with energy production or field operations.\n\n## Who’s it for?\n\n* Renewable energy teams monitoring solar/wind energy output vs weather\n* Facility or operations managers requiring daily climate updates\n* Researchers or analysts logging environmental metrics\n* Any team needing automated, daily weather reports by email\n\n## How it works?\n\n* The workflow begins with a **Schedule Trigger** set to run at **10:00 AM IST daily**.\n* It calls the **OpenWeather API** to fetch weather metrics for a predefined location.\n* The data is then passed to a **Google Sheets node named \"Append Weather to Sheet\"**, which stores all the key values into a structured spreadsheet.\n* A **Set or Function node** generates a clean, styled HTML email using inline CSS and the weather values.\n* Finally, a **Gmail node** sends this report to one or more recipients with a clear subject line and formatted body.\n\n## How to set up?\n\n1. Create/Open your n8n instance (Cloud or Self-hosted).\n2. Connect the following credentials:\n\t* Google Sheets (OAuth2)\n\t* Gmail (OAuth2)\n3. Set your OpenWeather API key in the **HTTP Request** node (`api.openweathermap.org`).\n4. Replace latitude/longitude in the request URL as per your location.\n5. Link a Google Sheet and define the correct tab name and headers.\n6. Configure recipient email(s) in the **Gmail node**.\n7. Deploy the workflow and test.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* n8n account (self-hosted or cloud)\n* OpenWeather API key (free or paid)\n* Google account with access to:\n\t- Google Sheets\n\t- Gmail\n* A valid Google Sheet created with the following headers (columns):\n\n```\nCountry\nLocation Latitude\nLocation Longitude\nTemperature (°C)\nFeels Like (°C)\nMin Temp (°C)\nMax Temp (°C)\nHumidity (%)\nPressure (hPa)\nSea Level (hPa)\nGround Level (hPa)\nVisibility (m)\nWind Speed (m/s)\nWind Direction (°)\nWind Gust (m/s)\nCloudiness (%)\nSunrise (UTC)\nSunset (UTC)\nDate Time (UTC)\n```\n\n## How to customize?\n\n* Change the **scheduled time** in the Schedule Trigger node.\n* Modify the **location coordinates** in the OpenWeather API URL.\n* Update the **HTML template** with different formatting or styling.\n* Add a **second email** or sheet for energy output to correlate with weather.\n* Extend the workflow with Slack, Notion, or Telegram alerts.\n\n## Add‑ons\n\n* Integrate with a **solar energy API** to track power production with weather.\n* Post weather summaries to **Notion**, **Slack** or internal dashboards.\n* Generate a visual **chart in Google Sheets** over time using the collected data.\n* Trigger alerts when specific thresholds are exceeded (e.g., wind gust &gt; 10 m/s).\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n* **Solar farm reporting**: Monitor daily weather impact on solar panel output.\n* **Logistics planning**: Notify teams of visibility or wind risks before dispatch.\n* **Site operations**: Send forecasts to maintenance or ground staff.\n* **Academic/weather logging**: Track atmospheric data over time.\n\n## Common Troubleshooting\n\n| **Issue** | **Possible Cause** | **Solution** |\n| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Email not sent | Gmail credentials not connected properly | Reconnect Gmail account via n8n credential manager |\n| Weather data is missing fields | API response changed or API key invalid | Verify OpenWeather API key and URL format |\n| Google Sheet not updating | Incorrect spreadsheet ID or tab name | Double-check spreadsheet ID and sheet name in node |\n| HTML email renders incorrectly | Broken or missing tags in HTML | Test output HTML separately in browser/email preview tool |\n\n---\n\n## **Need Help?**\n\nIf you need assistance setting up or customizing this workflow, feel free reach out.
