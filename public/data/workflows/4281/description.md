### Who this is for
The Real Estate Intelligence Tracker is a powerful automated workflow designed for real estate analysts, investors, proptech startups, and market researchers who need to collect and analyze structured data from real estate listings across the web at scale.

This workflow is tailored for:

- **Real Estate Analysts** - Tracking property prices, locations, and market trends

- **Investment Firms** - Sourcing high-opportunity listings for portfolio decisions

- **PropTech Developers** - Automating listing insights for SaaS platforms

- **Market Researchers** - Extracting insights from competitive housing data

- **Growth Teams** - Monitoring geographic property trends and pricing fluctuations

### What problem is this workflow solving?
Collecting structured real estate listing data from property websites is difficult due to bot protections and unstructured HTML content. Manual data collection is slow and error-prone, and traditional scrapers often get blocked or miss context.

This workflow solves:

- Automated bypass of anti-bot protection using Bright Data Web Unlocker

- Conversion of unstructured HTML content into clean text using a Markdown-to-text LLM pipeline

- Structured extraction of key listing data like price, location, property type, and features using OpenAI

- Aggregation and delivery of insights to Google Sheets, local storage, and webhook-based alerts

### What this workflow does

**Convert to Text**: Transforms scraped HTML/markdown into clean text using a Basic LLM Chain

**Structured Data Extraction**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o with the Information Extractor node to parse property attributes (price, address, area, type, etc.)

**Aggregate & Merge**: Combines data from multiple pages or listings into a cohesive structure

**Outbound Data Handling**:

- **Google Sheets** – Appends the structured real estate data for further analysis

- **Save to Disk** – Persists structured JSON/text data locally

- **Webhook Notification** – Sends data alerts or summaries to any third-party platform
