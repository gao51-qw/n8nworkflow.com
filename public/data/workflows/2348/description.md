This is a simple template to show how to extract multiple email attachments and return them as an iterable output. 

## How it works: 
The **Gmail Trigger** node detects any new email that has attachments. The **Code** node will then extract them as binary files and attaches them to the item. They can then be uploaded via the **Google Drive** node. 

## Setup steps:
- add your Gmail Credentials
- add your Google Drive Credentials
- Follow the official [n8n Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) for help
