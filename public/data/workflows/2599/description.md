This workflow facilitates seamless synchronization between Entra (Microsoft Azure AD) and Zammad. It automates the following processes:

1. **Fetch Entra Contacts**: 
2. **Create Universal User Object**: Extracts key user information, such as email, phone, and name, and formats it for Zammad compatibility.
3. **Synchronize with Zammad**:
   - Identifies users in Zammad who need updates based on Entra data.
   - Adds new users from Entra to Zammad.
   - Deactivates users in Zammad if they are no longer in Entra.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Matching**: Compares contacts from Entra with existing Zammad users based on email and updates records accordingly.
- **Efficient Management**: Automatically creates, updates, or deactivates Zammad users based on their status in Entra.
- **Custom Fields**: Supports custom field mapping, ensuring enriched user profiles in Zammad.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Microsoft Entra Integration**:
   - Ensure proper API permissions for accessing Entra contacts.
   - Configure Microsoft OAuth2 credentials in n8n.

2. **Zammad Integration**:
   - Set up Zammad API credentials with appropriate access rights.
   - Customize the workflow to include additional fields or map existing fields as needed.

3. **Run Workflow**:
   - Trigger the workflow manually or set up an automation schedule (e.g., daily sync).
   - Review created/updated/deactivated users in Zammad.

## Use Cases

- **IT Administration**: Keep your support system in sync with the organization’s Entra data.
- **Customer Management**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date user records in Zammad.

## Prerequisites
