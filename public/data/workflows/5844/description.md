### This n8n workflow is a Telegram bot that allows users to either:

- Generate AI images using Pollinations API, or
- Generate blog articles using Gemini AI

### Users simply type image your prompt or blog your title, and the bot responds with either an AI-generated image or article.

## Requirements

- Telegram bot (via @BotFather)
- Pollinations API (free and public endpoint)
- Google Sheets & Drive (OAuth credential setup in n8n)
- Google Gemini / PaLM API key via LangChain
- Self-hosted or cloud n8n setup


## Setup Instructions

- Clone the workflow and import it into your n8n instance

- Set credentials:

  - Telegram API
  - Google Sheets OAuth
  - Google Drive OAuth
  - Gemini (via LangChain)

- Replace:

  - Sheet ID with your own Google Sheet
  - Folder ID on Google Drive
  - chat_id placeholders if needed (use expressions instead)

- Deploy and send /start in your Telegram bot


## 🔧 Customization Tips

- Edit the Gemini prompt to adjust article length or tone

- Add extra style buttons like "SEO", "Story", "Academic"

- Add image post-processing (e.g. compression, renaming)

- Add error catching logic (e.g. if Pollinations image fails)

- Store images with filenames based on timestamp/user



## Security Considerations

- Use n8n credentials for all tokens (Telegram, Gemini, Sheets, Drive)

- Never hardcode your token inside HTTP nodes

- Do not expose real Google Sheet or Drive links in shared version

- Use Set node to collect all editable variables (like folder ID, sheet name)
