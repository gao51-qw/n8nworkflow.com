  "description": "## Overview\n- This workflow allows you to **trigger custom logic in n8n directly from Retell's Voice Agent** using [Custom Functions](https://docs.retellai.com/build/conversation-flow/custom-function#custom-function).\n- It captures a POST webhook from Retell every time a Voice Agent reaches a Custom Function node.\n- You can plug in any logic—call an external API, book a meeting, update a CRM, or even return a dynamic response back to the agent.\n\n## Who is it for\nFor builders using [Retell](https://www.retellai.com/) who want to **extend Voice Agent functionality** with real-time custom workflows or AI-generated responses.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Have a [Retell AI Account](https://www.retellai.com/)\n- A Retell agent with a Custom Function node in its conversation flow (see template below)\n- Set your n8n webhook URL in the Custom Function configuration (see \"How to use it\" below)\n- (Optional) Familiarity with [Retell's Custom Function docs](https://docs.retellai.com/build/conversation-flow/custom-function#custom-function)\n- Start a conversation with the agent (text or voice)\n\n## Retell Agent Example\nTo get you started, **[we've prepared a Retell Agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rAcsNz-f8SyuOxO0VJ_84oPscYFpir4-/view?usp=sharing)** ready to be imported, that includes the call to this template.\n- Import the agent to your Retell workspace (top-right button [on your agent's page](https://dashboard.retellai.com/agents))\n- You will need to modify the function URL in order to call your own instance.\n- This template is a simple hotel agent that calls the custom function to confirm a booking, passing basic formatted data.\n\n## How it works\n- Retell sends a webhook to n8n whenever a Custom Function is triggered during a call (or test chat).\n- The webhook includes:\n    - Full call context (transcript, call ID, etc.)\n    - Parameters defined in the Retell function node\n- You can process this data and return a response string back to the Voice Agent in real-time.\n\n## How to use it\n1. Copy the webhook URL (e.g. `https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/hotel-retell-template`)\n2. Modify the Retell Custom Function webhook URL (see template description for screenshots)\n    - Edit the function\n    ![retell_functions.png](fileId:1211)\n    - Modify the URL\n    ![retell_function_config.png](fileId:1212)\n3. Modify the logic in the Set node or replace it with your own custom flow\n4. Deploy and test: Retell will hit your n8n workflow during the conversation\n\n## Extension Ideas\n- Call a third-party API to fetch data (e.g. hotel availability, CRM records)\n- Use an LLM node to generate dynamic responses\n- Trigger a parallel automation (Slack message, calendar invite, etc.)\n\n#### 👉 [Reach out to us](mailto:hello@agentstudio.io) if you're interested in **analyzing your Retell Agent conversations**.\n",
