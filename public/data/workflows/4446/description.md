AI Agent – Processes the message to determine the user's intent (booking or canceling) and extracts necessary details like date, time, and participant names.

Google Calendar Node – Depending on the intent:

Booking: Creates a new event in Google Calendar with the extracted details.

Canceling: Searches for the specified event and deletes it from the calendar.

Telegram Node – Sends a confirmation message back to the user, informing them of the successful booking or cancellation.
