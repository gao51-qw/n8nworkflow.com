  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nRecruiters, B2B marketers, and thought-leadership builders who want to boost their LinkedIn engagement by automatically liking fresh, relevant posts—while staying under LinkedIn’s daily limits.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs hourly at a specified minute.  \n2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating LinkedIn session-cookie (time-slice logic).  \n3. **Generate Random Search Term** (GPT-4o) outputs a realistic AI/BPA keyword.  \n4. **Phantombuster LinkedIn Content Search Agent** scrapes recent posts → **Get Posts**.  \n5. **Get Random Post** selects one post, checks it isn’t already liked (SharePoint CSV) and appends the company-ID query param. If a personal LinkedIn Account is used, no company-ID is needed.\n6. Creates `linkedin_posts_to_like.csv`, uploads to SharePoint, and provides the URL to **Autolike Agent** which likes the post.  \n7. The post URL is added to `linkedin_posts_already_liked.csv` to avoid duplicates.  \n8. **Wait** nodes throttle launches to ≈400 likes/day.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  \n   • `linkedin_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n   • `linkedin_posts_already_liked.csv` with header `postUrl`.  \n3. Update **Set ENV Variables** with your LinkedIn company ID (`ENV_COMPANY_ID_LINKEDIN`).  \n4. Adjust schedule or likes-per-launch as needed.  \n5. Activate the workflow; it will run hourly and like one new post per launch.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- OpenAI account (GPT-4o)  \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Change niche: edit the prompt in **Generate Random Search Term**.  \n- Like more posts: raise `numberOfLinesPerLaunch` and schedule frequency.  \n- Swap SharePoint for Google Drive/Dropbox: replace the upload/download nodes.",
