## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

1. Triggers every 5 minutes to monitor website health.
2. Fetches a list of website URLs from a Google Sheet.
3. Checks the status of each website one by one.
4. Sends instant alerts if a website is **down** (Email, Slack, Telegram, Voice Call).
5. Logs downtime events in Google Sheets.
6. Tracks when websites are back **up** and updates the log.
7. Sends recovery notifications when a site is live again (Email, Slack, Telegram).

## 🧠 How it Works

### ⏱ 1. Scheduled Monitoring
A **Schedule Trigger** runs the workflow every 5 minutes. It reads the list of URLs from the Google Sheet and loops through each one.

### 🌍 2. Website Health Check
Each website is pinged to check if it’s online.

### 🔴 3. If Website is Down:
- It verifies if a downtime record already exists.
- If not, it:
  - Adds a new row in the Google Sheet with the timestamp.
  - Sends notifications via:
    - 📧 **Email**
    - 💬 **Slack**
    - 📲 **Telegram**
    - 📞 **Voice Call via Vapi**

### 🟢 4. If Website is Back Up:
- It fetches the matching downtime record.
- Updates the sheet with:
  - ✅ Uptime timestamp
  - ⏱ Total downtime duration
- Sends recovery notifications via:
  - 📧 **Email**
  - 💬 **Slack**
  - 📲 **Telegram**  
(No phone call is made for uptime.)
