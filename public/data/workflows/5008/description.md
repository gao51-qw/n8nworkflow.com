## ⚙️ How it Works

The workflow operates through two parallel processes:

### Process 1: Call Initiation (Manual/On-Demand)
1. **Trigger**: Manual start or scheduled batch processing
2. **Lead Retrieval**: Fetches leads marked "Pending" or "Retry Scheduled" from Google Sheets
3. **Validation**: Checks retry count (max 5 attempts) and routes accordingly
4. **API Call**: Sends request to Vapi with lead details and AI assistant configuration
5. **Status Update**: Marks lead as "Call Initiated" with unique call ID
6. **Batch Processing**: Loops through all eligible leads with controlled pacing

### Process 2: Result Collection (Every 10 Minutes)
1. **Schedule Trigger**: Automatic execution every 10 minutes
2. **Active Call Check**: Identifies all "Call Initiated" records
3. **Result Fetching**: Retrieves call outcomes from Vapi API
4. **Data Processing**: Extracts recordings, transcripts, summaries, and interest scores
5. **Sheet Update**: Writes complete results or schedules retry for missed calls
6. **Team Notification**: Sends Slack alerts on batch completion

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **n8n Instance**: Version 1.0.0+ (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Google Account**: With Sheets API enabled
- **Vapi Account**: Active subscription with API access
- **Slack Workspace**: Optional, for notifications

### Step 1: Prepare Your Lead Database

Create a Google Sheet with these exact columns (case-sensitive):
```
Customer_id | Name | Phone Number | Email | Status | Recording URL | Transcript | Summary | Interest | Call Duration | Retry count | Last attempt | Call ID
```

**Initial Setup:**
- `Customer_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., LEAD001)
- `Name`: Full name for personalization
- `Phone Number`: International format (+14155551234)
- `Email`: For follow-up campaigns
- `Status`: Set to "Pending"
- `Retry count`: Set to 0
- Other fields: Leave empty (auto-populated)

### Step 2: Configure Vapi AI Assistant

1. **Create Your AI Voice Agent**
   - Log into [vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai)
   - Navigate to Assistants → Create New
   - Design your conversation flow
   - Configure voice settings (gender, accent, speed)
   - Set up objection handling
   - Save and copy the `Assistant ID`

2. **Set Up Phone Number**
   - Go to Phone Numbers → Purchase/Import
   - Select local or toll-free number
   - Configure caller ID settings
   - Copy the `Phone Number ID`

### Step 3: Import & Configure Workflow

1. **Import to n8n**
   - Download `Cold_calling_loop.json`
   - In n8n: Import → From File
   - Select the JSON file

2. **Connect Credentials**
   - **Google Sheets**: OAuth2 authentication
   - **Vapi API**: HTTP Header Auth
     - Name: `Authorization`
     - Value: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
   - **Slack**: OAuth2 (optional)

3. **Update Configuration**
   - All Google Sheets nodes: Select your spreadsheet
   - HTTP Request nodes: Update `assistantId` and `phoneNumberId`
   - Slack nodes: Choose notification channels

### Step 4: Test & Deploy

1. Add test lead with your phone number
2. Execute workflow manually
3. Answer call and complete conversation
4. Verify results in Google Sheet
5. Activate workflow for production

## 🔄 Workflow Logic Explained

### Status Flow Diagram
```
[New Lead: Pending] → [Call Initiated] → [Completed/Failed]
                                      ↓
                            [Retry Scheduled] ← (if failed & retry &lt; 5)
```

### Key Decision Points

1. **Retry Limit Check (If1 Node)**
   - Condition: `Retry count ≤ 5`
   - True: Proceed with call
   - False: Mark as "Max Retries Reached"

2. **Call Completion Check (If2 Node)**
   - Validates: Recording exists, transcript available, analysis complete
   - Success: Update with full results
   - Failure: Schedule retry with incremented counter

3. **Status Routing (If4 Node)**
   - "Pending": Direct to call queue
   - "Retry Scheduled": Add wait period before calling

## 📊 Node Reference Guide

### Core Processing Nodes

| Node | Type | Purpose | Configuration |
|------|------|---------|---------------|
| Get Leads from Sheet1 | Google Sheets | Fetches eligible leads | Filter: Status = "Pending" OR "Retry Scheduled" |
| HTTP Request | HTTP | Initiates Vapi call | POST to api.vapi.ai/call with assistant config |
| Loop Over Items | Split In Batches | Processes leads individually | Batch size: 1, ensures sequential processing |
| Get Call Data | HTTP | Retrieves call results | GET from api.vapi.ai/call?id={callId} |
| Edit Fields2 | Set | Formats result data | Maps Vapi response to sheet columns |

### Status Management Nodes

| Node | Updates | Trigger |
|------|---------|---------|
| Update Status - Calling1 | "Call Initiated" | After successful API call |
| Update Status - Calling | "Done" + results | When call completed successfully |
| Update Status - for Missed call | "Retry Scheduled" | When call failed/no answer |
| Update Status - Calling3 | "Retry Done" | After retry limit reached |

### Control Flow Nodes

| Node | Function | Logic |
|------|----------|-------|
| If1 | Retry validation | Checks retry count ≤ 5 |
| If2 | Result validation | Verifies call completion |
| Wait | Retry delay | Pauses before retry attempt |
| Merge | Path combination | Unifies success/retry flows |

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### 1. Modify Retry Strategy
```javascript
// Add to Code node for progressive delays
const retryCount = $json["Retry count"];
const delays = {
  1: 30,    // 30 minutes
  2: 120,   // 2 hours
  3: 1440,  // Next day
  4: 2880,  // 2 days
  5: 10080  // 1 week
};
return { waitMinutes: delays[retryCount] || 60 };
```

### 2. Add Business Hours Check
```javascript
// Add before HTTP Request node
const now = new Date();
const hour = now.getHours();
const day = now.getDay();

const isWeekday = day &gt;= 1 && day &lt;= 5;
const isBusinessHours = hour &gt;= 9 && hour &lt;= 17;

if (!isWeekday || !isBusinessHours) {
  throw new Error('Outside calling hours');
}
```

### 3. Enhance Lead Context
```json
{
  "assistantId": "your-assistant-id",
  "phoneNumberId": "your-phone-id",
  "customer": {
    "number": "+{{ $json['Phone Number'] }}",
    "name": "{{ $json.Name }}",
    "customData": {
      "company": "{{ $json.Company }}",
      "lastPurchase": "{{ $json['Last Purchase Date'] }}",
      "accountValue": "{{ $json['Account Value'] }}",
      "preferredProduct": "{{ $json['Product Interest'] }}"
    }
  }
}
```
