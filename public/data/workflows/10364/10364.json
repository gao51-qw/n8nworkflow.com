Add your own credentials in:\n   - **Google Sheets**\n   - **HTTP Request**\n   - **AI/LLM** nodes\n3. Execute the workflow or trigger via form.\n4. Check your connected Google Sheet for generated posts and media links.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Requirements\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|----------|\n| **OpenAI / compatible LLM key** | Caption & idea generation |\n| **Image/Video generation API** | Creating visuals |\n| **Google Sheets credentials** | Storing results |\n| *(Optional)* n8n Cloud / self-hosted | To run the workflow |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Notes\n- The workflow uses **modular sub-workflows** for image and video creation; you can connect your own generation nodes.  \n- All credentials and private URLs have been removed.  \n- Works seamlessly with both **n8n Cloud** and **self-hosted** setups.  \n- Output is meant for **creative inspiration** — review before posting publicly.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 Why it’s useful\n- Speeds up **campaign ideation** and **content creation**.  \n- Provides structured, reusable results in Google Sheets.  \n- Fully visual, modular, and customizable for any brand or industry.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Example Use Cases\n- Influencer campaign planning  \n- Product launch creatives  \n- E-commerce catalog posts  \n- Fashion, lifestyle, or tech brand content\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Security & best practices\n- No hardcoded keys or credentials included.  \n- All private URLs replaced with placeholders.  \n- Static data removed from the public JSON.  \n- Follows n8n’s template structure, node naming, and sticky-note annotation guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### 📦 Template info\n**Name:** AI-Powered Influencer Post Generator with Google Sheets and Image/Video APIs\n**Category:** AI / Marketing Automation / Content Generation  \n**Author:** Palak Rathor  \n**Version:** 1.0 (Public Release — October 2025)",

Paste your **Google Sheet ID** into the Google Sheets nodes.  \n2. Add your **API keys or URLs** inside the HTTP Request and AI nodes.  \n3. Click **Execute Workflow** (or trigger via form).  \n4. Check your Google Sheet for the generated post ideas and media links.\n\n---\n\n### **Requirements**\n- OpenAI (or compatible LLM) API key  \n- Image / Video generation API (KIE, Repanda, etc.)  \n- Google Sheets credentials  \n\n---\n\n### **Notes**\nAI output is for **creative inspiration only** — always review and refine before publishing.  \nIf your API or Sheet ID changes, update them directly in the relevant nodes."
