This template transforms uploaded brand assets into **AI-generated influencer-style posts** — complete with captions, images, and videos — using n8n, OpenAI, and your preferred image/video generation APIs.

### 🧠 Who it’s for
Marketers, creators, or brand teams who want to speed up **content ideation** and **visual generation**.  
Perfect for social-media teams looking to turn product photos and brand visuals into ready-to-review creative posts.

---

### ⚙️ How it works
1. **Upload your brand assets** — A form trigger collects up to three files: product, background, and prop.  
2. **AI analysis & content creation** — An OpenAI LLM analyzes your brand tone and generates post titles, captions, and visual prompts.  
3. **Media generation** — Connected image/video generation workflows create corresponding visuals.  
4. **Result storage** — All captions, image URLs, and video URLs are automatically written to a Google Sheet for review or publishing.
