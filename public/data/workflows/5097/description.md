This workflow connects Telegram to Midjourney through GoAPI, enabling automated image generation and upscaling directly from chat.

### How it Works
* **Telegram Command Trigger**: The workflow activates upon receiving a message in Telegram.
* **Image Generation**: Your prompt is sent to GoAPI, which then generates an image using Midjourney.
* **Upscale Selection**: You receive the generated image and select an option for upscaling.
* **Image Upscaling**: The selected image is upscaled via GoAPI.
* **Notifications and Logs**: Progress updates are sent to Telegram, and all images are logged in Discord.

### Set Up Steps
1.  Create a Telegram Bot and update credentials in Telegram nodes.
2.  Create a GoAPI account, obtain an API key, and update the three HTTP nodes: "Get Generation Task," "Upscale," and "Get Upscale Task".
3.  (Optional) Configure the Discord node for logging if desired.

Setup takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Detailed descriptions are available in sticky notes within the workflow.
