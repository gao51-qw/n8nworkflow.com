  "description": "# WhatsApp Receipt OCR & Data Extraction Suite  \n**Categories:** Accounting Automation • OCR Processing • AI Data Extraction • Business Tools\n\nThis workflow transforms WhatsApp into a fully automated receipt-processing system using advanced OCR, multi-model AI parsing, and structured data storage. By combining LlamaParse, Claude (OpenRouter), Gemini, Google Sheets, and Twilio, it eliminates manual data entry and delivers instant, reliable receipt digitization for any business.\n\n---\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nWhen a user sends a receipt photo or PDF via WhatsApp, the automation:\n\n1. **Receives the file through Twilio WhatsApp**\n2. **Uploads and parses it with LlamaParse (high-res OCR + invoice preset)**\n3. **Extracts structured data using Claude + Gemini + a strict JSON parser**\n4. **Cleans and normalizes the data (dates, ABN, vendor, tax logic)**\n5. **Uploads the receipt to Google Drive**\n6. **Logs the extracted fields into a Google Sheet**\n7. **Replies to the user on WhatsApp with the extracted details**\n8. **Asks for confirmation via quick-reply buttons**\n9. **Updates the Google Sheet based on user validation**\n\nThe result is a fast, scalable, human-free system for converting raw receipt photos into clean, structured accounting data.\n\n---\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **No friction for users:** receipts are submitted simply by sending a WhatsApp message.  \n- **High-accuracy OCR:** LlamaParse extracts text, tables, totals, vendors, tax, and ABN with impressive reliability.  \n- **Enterprise-grade data validation:** complex logic ensures the correct interpretation of GST, included taxes, or unidentified tax amounts.  \n- **Multi-model extraction:** Claude and Gemini both analyse the OCR output for more reliable result. We have one primary LLM and a secondary one.\n- **Hands-off accounting:** every receipt becomes a standardized row in Google Sheets.  \n- **Two-way WhatsApp communication:** users can confirm or reject extracted data instantly.  \n- **Scalable architecture:** perfect for businesses handling dozens or thousands of receipts monthly.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works (Technical Overview)\n\n### 1. **Twilio → Webhook Trigger**  \nThe workflow starts when a WhatsApp message containing a media file hits your Twilio webhook.\n\n### 2. **Initial Google Sheets Logging**  \nThe MessageSid is appended to your tracking sheet to ensure every receipt is traceable.\n\n### 3. **LlamaParse OCR**  \nThe file is sent to LlamaParse with the invoice preset, high-resolution OCR, and table extraction enabled.  \nThe workflow checks job completion before moving further.\n\n### 4. **LLM Data Extraction**\nThe OCR markdown is analyzed using:\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via OpenRouter)\n- Gemini 2.5 Pro  \n- A strict structured JSON output parser  \n- Custom JS cleanup logic\n\nThe system extracts:\n- Vendor  \n- Cost  \n- Tax (with multi-rule Australian GST logic)  \n- Currency  \n- Date (parsed + normalized)  \n- ABN (validated and digit-normalized)\n\n### 5. **Google Drive Integration**  \nThe uploaded receipt is stored, shared, and linked back to the record in Sheets.\n\n### 6. **Google Sheets Update**  \nFields are appended/updated following a clean schema:\n- Vendor  \n- Cost  \n- Tax  \n- Date  \n- Currency  \n- ABN  \n- Public drive link  \n- Status (Confirmed / Not confirmed)\n\n### 7. **User Response Flow**\nThe user receives a summary of extracted data via WhatsApp.  \nButtons allow them to approve or reject accuracy.  \nThe Google Sheet updates accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n- Accounting & bookkeeping firms  \n- Outsourced finance departments  \n- Small businesses tracking expenses  \n- Field workers submitting receipts  \n- Automation agencies offering DFY systems  \n- CFOs wanting real-time expense visibility\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Expense reconciliation  \n- Automated bookkeeping  \n- Receipt digitization & compliance  \n- Real-time employee expense submission  \n- Multi-client automation at accounting agencies  \n\n---\n\n## Required Integrations\n\n- **Twilio WhatsApp** (Business API number + webhook)  \n- **LlamaParse API**  \n- **OpenRouter (Claude Sonnet)**  \n- **Google Gemini API**  \n- **Google Drive**  \n- **Google Sheets**  \n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions (High-Level)\n\n1. Import the n8n workflow.  \n2. Connect your Twilio WhatsApp account.  \n3. Add API credentials for:\n   - LlamaParse  \n   - OpenRouter  \n   - Google Gemini  \n   - Google Drive  \n   - Google Sheets  \n4. Create your target Google Sheet.  \n5. Configure your WhatsApp webhook URL in Twilio.  \n6. Test with a sample receipt.\n\n---\n\n## Why This System Works\n\n- Users send receipts using a tool they already use daily (WhatsApp).  \n- LlamaParse provides state-of-the-art OCR for low-quality receipts.  \n- Using **multiple LLMs** drastically increases accuracy for vendor, ABN, and tax extraction.  \n- Advanced normalization logic ensures data is clean and accounting-ready.  \n- Google Sheets enables reliable storage, reporting, and future integrations.  \n- End-to-end automation replaces hours of manual work with instant processing.\n\n---\n\n## Watch My Complete Build Process\n\nWant to see exactly how I built this entire AI design system from scratch?
