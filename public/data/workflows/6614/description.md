## What does this workflow do?

This workflow acts as the backend "brain" for a sophisticated AI Voice Interviewer. It receives a user's resume text and a target job description, then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to conduct a realistic, voice-based interview. The workflow maintains conversation history to ask relevant follow-up questions, creating a dynamic and personalized interview practice experience.

This template is designed to work with a simple HTML frontend that handles the voice-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.

## What services does this workflow use?

- **Google Gemini:** This is the LLM used to generate intelligent interview questions. You can easily swap this out for other models like OpenAI.

## What credentials do you need to have?

You will need one credential:
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one for free from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
