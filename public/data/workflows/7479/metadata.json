  "title": "Turn YouTube comments into content ideas with GPT-4.1-mini, Tavily & Apify",
  "description": "## Description\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to turn raw YouTube comments into **research-backed content ideas** complete with **hooks and outlines**.\n\nUse cases include:\n\n* Quickly mining a competitor’s audience for video ideas.  \n* Generating hooks and outlines for your own channel’s comments.  \n* Validating content opportunities with live audience feedback.  \n\n**Good to know**\n\n* Apify is used to scrape YouTube comments (requires an API token).  \n* GPT-4.1-mini is used for both filtering and content generation.  \n* Tavily provides fresh research to ground the AI’s responses.  \n* All outputs are stored in Google Sheets, making it easy to manage and track ideas.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Trigger** – Paste a YouTube URL into the chat trigger.  \n2. **Scrape Comments** – Apify fetches all comments and metadata.  \n3. **Filter** – GPT-4.1-mini decides if each comment could inspire a content idea.  \n4. **Store** – Comments and “Yes/No” decisions are appended to Google Sheets.  \n5. **Research & Enrich** – For “Yes” comments, Tavily provides context, and GPT generates a topic, hook, and outline.  \n6. **Update Sheet** – The same row in Google Sheets is updated with enriched fields.  \n\n---\n\n## Google Sheets Setup  \n\nYour Google Sheet should include these columns (in this order):  \n\n\nid | text | author | likes | isIdea | topic | research | hook | outline\n- **id** – unique identifier for each comment  \n- **text** – the full YouTube comment  \n- **author** – commenter’s name/handle  \n- **likes** – number of likes on the comment  \n- **isIdea** – “Yes” or “No” depending on GPT filter  \n- **topic** – extracted video topic  \n- **research** – 300–500 word background from Tavily  \n- **hook** – engaging opening sentence for a video  \n- **outline** – structured video outline  \n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n* Connect your **Apify**, **OpenAI**, **Tavily**, and **Google Sheets** credentials in n8n.  \n* Point the Google Sheets nodes to your own document and ensure the above headers exist.  \n* Replace sample API keys with your own stored in n8n Credentials.  \n\n**Time to set up:** \\~15–25 minutes for a first-time n8n user (less if you already have credentials handy).  \n\n---\n\n## Customizing this workflow  \n\n* **Filter logic** – Loosen the GPT filter to allow borderline ideas, or tighten it to only accept the best ones.  \n* **Research depth** – Change Tavily’s search depth (e.g., `depth: basic` vs `depth: advanced`) to control how detailed the background research is.  \n* **Notification channels** – Send new “Yes” ideas directly to **Slack** (`#content-ideas`), **Notion** (your content board), or **Email** (notify the content manager instantly).  \n* **Alternative outputs** – Instead of hooks/outlines, generate:  \n  - A **script draft** for YouTube Shorts.  \n  - **Blog post angles** based on the same audience comments.  \n  - A **poll question** for community engagement.  \n",
