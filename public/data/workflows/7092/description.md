This n8n template uses AI to automatically classify incoming Gmail messages into five categories and route them to the right people or departments. It can also reply automatically and send WhatsApp alerts for urgent or relevant messages.
This helps ensure high-priority emails never get missed, while other messages are handled efficiently.

##How It Works
1. Trigger
A new email in Gmail triggers the workflow.

2. Classification (OpenAI GPT)
The email is analyzed by an OpenAI GPT model and classified into one of:

High Priority
Customer Support
Promotion
Finance/Billing
Random/Other

3. Conditional Logic & Actions
High Priority → Create draft reply + send WhatsApp alert.

Customer Support → Auto-reply + send WhatsApp confirmation alert.

Promotion → Summarize email + send WhatsApp promotional alert.

Finance/Billing → Forward to finance team + send WhatsApp finance alert.

Random/Other → Label and log only.

4. Multi-Channel Output
Responses are sent via Gmail.
Alerts are sent via WhatsApp (or another compatible API).

##Setup Instructions
Step 1: Gmail Authorization
Add a Gmail node in n8n.
Connect using OAuth2 and grant read/send permissions.

Step 2: OpenAI API Key
Get your API key from OpenAI.
Add it to n8n credentials for the OpenAI node.

Step 3: WhatsApp Integration
Use your WhatsApp Business API or a provider like Twilio or 360Dialog.

Replace placeholders with your details:

[YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER]
[YOUR_FINANCE_TEAM_NUMBER]
[YOUR_SUPPORT_TEAM_NUMBER]

Step 4: Import & Run
Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
Adjust prompts, labels, and routing logic as needed.
Execute and monitor results.
