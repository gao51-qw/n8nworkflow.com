# Intelligent B2B lead generation workflow using Scrapeless and Claude

> &gt; ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This workflow uses [Scrapeless](https://scrapeless.com?utm_source=n8n&utm_campaign=b2b-leads) and Claude AI via *community nodes*, which require **n8n self-hosted** to work properly.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

This intelligent B2B lead generation workflow combines search automation, website crawling, AI analysis, and multi-channel output:

1. It starts by using **Scrapeless’s Deep Serp API** to find company websites from targeted Google Search queries.  
2. Each result is then **individually crawled** using Scrapeless's **Crawler** module, retrieving key business information from pages like `/about`, `/contact`, `/services`.  
3. The raw web content is processed via a **Code node** to clean, extract, and prepare structured data.  
4. The cleaned data is passed to **Claude Sonnet (Anthropic)** which analyzes and qualifies the lead based on content richness, contact data, and relevance.  
5. A **filter step** ensures only high-quality leads (e.g. lead score ≥ 6) are kept.  
6. Sent via **Discord webhook** for real-time notification (can be replaced with Slack, email, or CRM tools).

&gt; 📌 The result is a fully automated system that finds, qualifies, and organizes B2B leads with high efficiency and minimal manual input.

## ✅ Pre-Conditions

Before using this workflow, make sure you have:

- An **n8n self-hosted** instance  
- A **Scrapeless** account and API key ([get it here](https://app.scrapeless.com/passport/login))  
- An **Anthropic Claude API key**  
- A configured **Discord webhook URL** (or alternative notification service)

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

Manual Trigger → Scrapeless Google Search → Item Lists → Scrapeless Crawler
→ Code (Data Cleaning) → Claude Sonnet → Code (Response Parser)
→ Filter → Discord Notification


## 🔨 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Manual Trigger** – For testing purposes (can be replaced with Cron or Webhook)  
2. **Scrapeless Google Search** – Queries target B2B topics via Scrapeless’s Deep SERP API  
3. **Item Lists** – Splits search results into individual items  
4. **Scrapeless Crawler** – Visits each company domain and scrapes structured content  
5. **Code Node (Data Cleaner)** – Extracts and formats content for LLM input  
6. **Claude Sonnet (via HTTP Request)** – Evaluates lead quality, relevance, and contact info  
7. **Code Node (Parser)** – Parses Claude’s JSON response  
8. **IF Filter** – Filters leads based on score threshold  
9. **Discord Webhook** – Sends formatted message with company info

## 🧩 Customization Guidance

You can easily adjust the workflow to match your needs:

- **Lead Criteria**: Modify the Claude prompt and scoring logic in the Code node  
- **Output Channels**: Replace the Discord webhook with Slack, Email, Airtable, or any CRM node  
- **Search Topics**: Change your query in the Scrapeless SERP node to find leads in different niches or countries  
- **Scoring Threshold**: Adjust the filter logic (`lead_score &gt;= 6`) to match your quality tolerance
