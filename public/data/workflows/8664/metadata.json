Connect OpenAI & Facebook in **Credentials** (no API key inside nodes).\n2. In **Tool: Call Perplexity Researcher**, set your research `workflowId`.\n3. In **Publish: Facebook Graph API**, set your Page ID and edge.\n4. Adjust prompts/tone and the `LANGUAGE` in **CONFIG**.\n5. Test the flow with sample prompts in the chat.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)\n- OpenAI API key (stored in Credentials)\n- Facebook Page publish permissions\n- (Optional) a research workflow for Perplexity\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- Add moderation/review gates before publishing.\n- Duplicate the publish path for other platforms.\n- Store outputs in Sheets/Notion/DB for auditing.\n- Tune model choice & temperature for your brand voice.\n\n## Security\n- Avoid hardcoding secrets in HTTP or Code nodes.\n- Keep identifiers (Page IDs, workflowIds) configurable in **CONFIG**.",
