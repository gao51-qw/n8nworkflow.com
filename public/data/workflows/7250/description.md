## How it works?
This template creates an end-to-end real estate automation system that handles customer inquiries from initial contact through appointment booking.

### 1. Customer Entry Point

- Information extraction - scans messages for personal details and property requirements
- Human handoff detection - identifies requests for live agent assistance

### 3. Data Collection Phase
- Sequential gathering: Personal info (name → phone → email) then property needs
- Smart validation - phone format, email structure, budget parsing
- No redundancy - never asks for information already provided
- PostgreSQL storage - saves customer data and conversation memory

### 4. Property Search & Matching
