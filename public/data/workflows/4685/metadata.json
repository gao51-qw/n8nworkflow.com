  "description": "# **🔧 Workflow Summary**\n\nThis system automates LinkedIn lead generation and enrichment in six clear stages:\n\n**1. Lead Collection (via Apollo.io)**\n- Automatically pulls leads based on keywords, roles, or industries using Apollo’s API.\n- Captures name, job title, company, and LinkedIn profile URL.\n- You can kick off the workflow via form, webhook, WhatsApp, Telegram, or any other custom trigger that passes search parameters.\n\n**2. LinkedIn Username Extraction**\n- Extracts usernames from LinkedIn profile URLs using a script step.\n- These usernames are required for further enrichment using [RapidAPI](RapidAPI).\n\n**3. Email Retrieval (via Apollo.io User ID)**\n- Fetches verified work email using the Apollo User ID.\n- Email validity is double-checked using [www.mails.so](www) filtering out undeliverable or inactive emails by checking MX records and deliverability.\n\n**4. Profile Summary (via LinkedIn API on RapidAPI)**\n- Enriches lead data by pulling bio/summary details to understand their background and expertise.\n\n**5. Activity Insights (Posts & Reposts)**\n- Collects recent posts or reposts to help craft personalised messages based on what they’re currently engaging with.\n\n**6. Leads Sheet Update**\n- All data is written into a Google Sheet.\n- New columns are populated dynamically without erasing existing data.\n\n⸻\n\n## ✅ Smart Retry Logic\n\nEach workflow is equipped with a fail-safe system:\n- Tracks status per row: ✅ done, ❌ failed, ⏳ pending\n- Failed rows are automatically retried after a custom delay (e.g., 2 weeks).\n- Ensures minimal drop-offs and complete data coverage.\n\n\n\n## 📊 Google Sheets Setup\n\nMake a copy of the following:\n- Template 1: [Apollo Leads Scraper & Enrichment](sd)\n- Template 2: [Final Enriched Leads](link) \n\nThe system appends data (like emails, bios, activity) step by step.\n\n\n\n\n## 🔐 API Credentials Needed\n\n**1. Apollo API**\n- Sign up and generate API key at [Apollo Developer Portal](Apollo Developer Portal)\n- Be sure to enable the “Master API Key” toggle so the same key works for all endpoints.\n\n**2. LinkedIn Data API (via RapidAPI)**\n- Subscribe at [RapidAPI - LinkedIn Data](link)\n- Use your key in the `x-rapidapi-key`\n header.\n\n**3. Mails.so API**\n- Get [your API Key](link) from mails.so dashboard\n\n## 🛠️ Troubleshooting – LinkedIn Lead Machine\n\n**✅ Common Mistakes & Fixes**\n\n**1. API Keys Not Working**\n- Make sure API keys for Apollo, RapidAPI, and mails.so are correct.\n- Apollo “Master API Key” must be enabled.\n- Keys should be saved as Generic Credentials in n8n.\n\n**2. Leads Not Found**\n- Check if the search query (keyword/job title) is too narrow.\n- Apollo might return empty results if the filters are incorrect.\n\n**3. LinkedIn URLs Missing or Invalid**\n- Ensure Apollo is returning valid LinkedIn URLs.\n- Improper URLs will cause username extraction and enrichment steps to fail.\n\n**4. Emails Not Coming Through**\n- Apollo may not have verified emails for all leads.\n- mails.so might reject invalid or expired email addresses.\n\n**5. Google Sheet Not Updating**\n- Make sure the Google Sheet is shared with the right Google account (linked to n8n).\n- Check if the column names match and data isn’t blocked due to formatting.\n\n**6. Status Columns Not Changing**\n- Each row must have done, failed, or pending in the status column.\n- If the status doesn’t update, the retry logic won’t trigger.\n\n**7. RapidAPI Not Returning Data**\n- Double-check if username is present and valid.\n- Make sure the RapidAPI plan is active and within limits.\n\n**8. Workflow Not Running**\n- Check if the trigger node (form, webhook, etc.) is connected and active.\n- Make sure you’re passing the required inputs (keyword, role, etc.).\n\n------------\n\nNeed Help?
