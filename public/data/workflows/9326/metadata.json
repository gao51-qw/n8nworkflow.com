  "description": "## 🧾 Image Extraction Pipeline (Google Drive + VLM Run + n8n)\n\n### ⚙️ What This Workflow Does\n\nThis workflow automates the process of extracting images from uploaded documents in Google Drive using the **VLM Run Execute Agent**, then downloads and saves those extracted images into a designated Drive folder.\n\n### 🧩 Requirements\n- **Google Drive OAuth2 credentials**  \n- **VLM Run API credentials** with Execute Agent access  \n- A reachable **n8n Webhook URL** (e.g., `/image-extract-via-agent`)  \n\n### ⚡Quick Setup\n\n1. Configure Google Drive OAuth2 and create  upload folder and folder for saving extracted images.\n2. Install the verified [VLM Run node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vlm-run/n8n-nodes-vlmrun) by searching for **VLM Run** in the node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can start using it in your workflows.\n3. Add VLM Run [API credentials](https://app.vlm.run/dashboard) for document parsing.\n\n### ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Monitor Uploads** – The workflow watches a specific Google Drive folder for new file uploads (e.g., receipts, reports, or PDFs).  \n2. **Download File** – When a file is created, it’s automatically downloaded in binary form.  \n3. **Extract Images (VLM Run)** – The file is sent to the **VLM Run Execute Agent**, which analyzes the document and extracts image URLs via its callback.  \n4. **Receive Image Links (Webhook)** – The workflow’s Webhook node listens for the agent’s response containing extracted image URLs.  \n5. **Split & Download** – The `Split Out` node processes each extracted link, and the `HTTP Request` node downloads each image.  \n6. **Save Image** – Finally, each image is uploaded to your chosen **Google Drive folder** for storage or further processing.\n\n\n### 💡Why Use This Workflow\n\nManual image extraction from PDFs and scanned files is repetitive and error-prone.\nThis pipeline automates it using VLM Run, a vision-language AI service that:\n\n- Understands document layout and structure\n- Handles multi-page and mixed-content files\n- Extracts accurate image data with minimal setup. For example- the output contains URLs to extracted images\n\n```json\n{\n  \"image_urls\": [\n    \"https://vlm.run/api/files/img1.jpg\",\n    \"https://vlm.run/api/files/img2.jpg\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- Works with both images and PDFs\n\n### 🧠 Perfect For\n- Extracting photos or receipts from multi-page PDFs  \n- Archiving embedded images from reports or invoices  \n- Preparing image datasets for labeling or ML model training  \n\n\n### 🛠️ How to Customize\n\n- You can extend this workflow by:\n- Adding naming conventions or folder structures based on upload type\n- Integrating Slack/Email notifications when extraction completes\n- Including metadata logging (file name, timestamp, source) into Google Sheets or a database\n- Chaining with classification or OCR workflows using VLM Run’s other agents\n\n\n### ⚠️ Community Node Disclaimer\n\nThis workflow uses community nodes (VLM Run) that may need additional permissions and custom setup.\n\n\n",
