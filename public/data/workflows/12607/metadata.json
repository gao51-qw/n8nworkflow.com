  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nDevOps engineers, sysadmins, and website owners who manage multiple domains and need proactive SSL certificate expiration monitoring without manual checks.\n\n## What it does\n\nAutomatically monitors SSL certificates across multiple domains, tracks expiration status in a Google Sheet dashboard, and sends beautifully formatted HTML email alerts before certificates expire.\n\n**✅ No API rate limits** — Uses direct OpenSSL commands, so you can scan unlimited domains with zero API costs or restrictions.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Triggers on schedule (every 3 days at 10AM)\n- Reads domain list from your Google Sheet\n- Checks each domain's SSL certificate using OpenSSL commands\n- Parses expiration dates, issuer info, and calculates days remaining\n- Updates Google Sheet with current status for all domains\n- Sends styled email alerts only when certificates are expiring soon\n\n## Set up steps\n\n- Connect your Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials\n- Create a Google Sheet with these columns: **Domain**, **Expiry Date**, **Days Left**, **Status**, **Issuer**, **Last Checked** (the workflow matches on the Domain column to update results)\n- Add your domains to scan in the **Domain** column\n- Update the Sheet ID in the **Read Domain List from Google Sheets** and **Update Google Sheet with Results** nodes\n- Connect SMTP credentials in the **Send Alert Email via SMTP** node\n- Optionally adjust `ALERT_THRESHOLD_DAYS` in two nodes: **Prepare Domain List and Set Threshold** and **Parse SSL Results and Identify Expiring Certs** (default: 20 days)\n\nSetup time: ~10 minutes",
