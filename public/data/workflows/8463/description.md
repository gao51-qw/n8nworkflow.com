## Who’s it for
Marketing, growth, and analytics teams who want a **decision-ready GA4 summary**—automatically calculated, clearly color-coded, and emailed as a polished HTML report.

## How it works / What it does
- **Get Client (Form Trigger)** collects **GA4 Property ID (“Account ID”)**, **Key Event**, **date ranges (current & previous)**, **Client Name**, and **recipient email**.
- **Overall Metrics This Period / Previous Period (GA4 Data API)** pull sessions, users, engagement, bounce rate, and more for each range.
- **Form Submits This Period / Previous Period (GA4 Data API)** fetch key-event counts for conversion comparisons.
- **Code** normalizes form dates for API requests.
- **AI Agent** builds a **valid HTML email**:  
  - Calculates % deltas, applies **green for positive** (`#10B981`) and **red for negative** (`#EF4444`) changes.
  - Writes summary and recommendations.
  - Produces the **final HTML only**.
- **Send a message (Gmail)** sends the formatted HTML report to the specified email address with a contextual subject.

## How to set up
1) Add credentials: **Google Analytics OAuth2**, **OpenAI** (Chat), **Gmail OAuth2**.  
2) Ensure the form fields match your GA4 property and event names; **“Account ID” = GA4 Property ID**. 
Property ID - https://take.ms/vO2MG
Key event - https://take.ms/hxwQi
3) Publish the form URL and run a test submission.

## Requirements
GA4 property access (Viewer/Analyst) • OpenAI API key • Gmail account with send permission.
