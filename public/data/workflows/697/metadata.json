  "description": "![workflow-screenshot](fileId:264)\n\nThis workflow will archive your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist to an archive playlist named \"Discover Weekly Archive\" **which you must create yourself**. If you want to change the name of the archive playlist, you can edit `value2` in the \"Find Archive Playlist\" node.\n\nIt is configured to run at 8am on Mondays, a conservative value in case you forgot to set your `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable (see the docs [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/configuration.html#timezone)).\n\nSpecial thanks to [erin2722](https://community.n8n.io/u/erin2722) for creating the Spotify node and [harshil1712](https://community.n8n.io/u/harshil1712) for [help with the workflow logic](https://community.n8n.io/t/if-block-matches-string-literal-but-not-string-expression/2484).\n\nTo use this workflow, you'll need to:\n\n- Create then select your credentials in each Spotify node\n- Create the archive playlist yourself\n\nOptionally, you may choose to:\n- Edit the archive playlist name in the \"Find Archive Playlist\" node\n- Adjust the Cron node with an earlier time if you know `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` is set\n- Setup an error workflow like [this one](https://n8n.io/workflows/696) to be notified if anything goes wrong\n\n",
