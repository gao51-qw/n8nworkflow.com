  "description": "# Outlook & Notion Knowledge Base Builder for AI Agents  \n\nThis n8n template lets you automatically **build and maintain an AI-ready knowledge base** from Outlook emails and Notion pages.  \nIt stores both sources in a Pinecone vector database so your AI agent can reference them when generating answers, extracting information, or drafting context-aware emails.  \n\n## Who’s it for  \n- Teams using Outlook for client or customer communications.  \n- Businesses maintaining documentation or notes in Notion.  \n- Developers or AI builders who want to create custom knowledge bases for intelligent agents.  \n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Outlook Integration:**  \n   - When you move an email or thread to a specific folder (e.g., “knowledgebase”), the workflow triggers automatically.  \n   - It captures the entire conversation, removes duplicates, and stores it in Pinecone under a namespace called `\"emails\"`.  \n   - The AI agent later uses these stored emails to learn tone, structure, and context for drafting responses.  \n\n2. **Notion Integration:**  \n   - When a page is added to a designated Notion database, the workflow triggers.  \n   - The page content is extracted and embedded into Pinecone under the `\"knowledgebase\"` namespace.  \n   - This allows your agent to use your Notion pages as factual reference material when answering questions.  \n\n3. **AI Agent Setup:**  \n   - Uses **two Pinecone tools** — one to reference Notion content (knowledge base) and another for emails (style & tone).  \n   - Equipped with **Cohere embeddings** for multilingual support and **OpenAI** for conversation or drafting tasks.  \n   - When queried, the agent retrieves relevant knowledge from both namespaces to produce accurate, context-rich replies.  \n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import this template into your n8n account.  \n2. Connect your **Outlook account** and specify which folder to watch (e.g., “knowledgebase”).  \n3. Connect your **Notion account** and select your target database.  \n4. Connect your **Pinecone**, **Cohere**, and **OpenAI** credentials.  \n5. Activate the workflow — new Notion pages and Outlook threads will automatically update your knowledge base.  \n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n account.  \n- Microsoft Outlook account.  \n- Notion account and database.  \n- Pinecone account for vector storage.  \n- Cohere API key for embeddings.  \n- OpenAI API key for AI model.  \n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- **Namespaces:** Rename or expand namespaces (e.g., “sales_emails”, “internal_docs”) to organize knowledge types.  \n- **Embeddings Model:** Replace Cohere with OpenAI embeddings if preferred.  \n- **Agent Behavior:** Adjust the agent’s system message to change its tone or purpose (e.g., “act as a sales assistant”).  \n- **Extra Sources:** Extend this workflow to include PDFs, websites, or Slack messages.  \n- **Sync Schedule:** Modify trigger intervals to control how frequently updates are captured.  \n\n---\n\nThis workflow automatically builds a living, AI-powered knowledge base from your Outlook and Notion data — perfect for intelligent support, research, or content generation.  \n",
