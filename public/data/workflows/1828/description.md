This workflow creates or updates a Mautic contact when a new event is scheduled in Calendly. The first name and email address are the only two fields that get updated.

- Calendly account and [Calendly credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/calendly/).
- Mautic account and [Mautic credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/mautic/).

# How it works

1. Triggers on a new event in Calendly.
2. Creates a new contact in Mautic if the email address does not exist in Mautic.
3. Updates the contact's first name in Mautic if the email address exists in Mautic.
