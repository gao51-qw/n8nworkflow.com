  "description": "## 🌦️ Intelligent Aquaculture Automation for Indonesia\n\nTransform your fish farming operation with this cutting-edge n8n workflow that combines Indonesia's official BMKG weather data with IoT-powered feeding automation. This system intelligently reduces feed by 20% when rain probability exceeds 60%, preventing overfeeding during adverse weather conditions that could compromise water quality and fish health.\n\n## 🚀 Key Features\n\n**🌦️ Real-time BMKG Integration:** Fetches official Indonesian weather forecasts every 12 hours using BMKG's public API with precise ADM4 regional targeting\n\n**🤖 Smart Decision Engine:** Advanced JavaScript algorithms analyze 6-hour and 12-hour rain probabilities to make optimal feeding decisions automatically\n\n**📱 ESP8266 IoT Control:** Seamlessly sends HTTP webhook commands to your ESP8266/ESP32-based fish feeder hardware with JSON payloads\n\n**💬 Rich Telegram Notifications:** Comprehensive reports including weather analysis, feeding decisions, hardware status, and next feeding schedule\n\n**⏰ Precision Scheduling:** Automated execution at 05:30 and 16:30 WIB (Indonesian Western Time) with cron-based triggers\n\n**📊 Activity Logging:** Complete audit trail with timestamps, weather data, and feeding decisions for operational monitoring\n\n## 🛠️ Technical Architecture\n\n**Core Node Components:**\n- **Schedule Trigger:** Automated twice-daily execution\n- **HTTP Request:** BMKG API integration with timeout handling  \n- **Code (JavaScript):** Weather parsing and feeding ratio calculations\n- **IF Condition:** Intelligent branching based on configurable rain thresholds\n- **Telegram:** Formatted notifications with markdown support\n- **Set Variables:** Secure credential management with placeholder tokens\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n\n✅ **n8n Instance:** Self-hosted or cloud deployment  \n✅ **Telegram Bot:** Create via @BotFather for notifications  \n✅ **ESP8266/ESP32:** Hardware with servo motor for automated feeding  \n✅ **Arduino Skills:** Basic programming knowledge for hardware setup  \n✅ **Indonesian Location:** Uses BMKG API with ADM4 regional codes  \n\n## ⚙️ Configuration Requirements\n\n**📍 Location Settings:** Update latitude, longitude, and BMKG ADM4 code in the Config node  \n**🤖 Telegram Bot:** Configure bot token and chat ID in credentials  \n**🔗 ESP8266 Webhook:** Set your device's IP address for hardware communication  \n**📊 Feeding Parameters:** Customize rain threshold (default: 60%) and feed reduction (default: -20%)\n\n## 🎯 Perfect For\n\n**🏭 Commercial Aquaculture:** Large-scale fish farming operations requiring weather-aware feeding\n**🏠 Hobbyist Enthusiasts:** Home aquarium and pond automation projects  \n**🌱 Smart Agriculture:** Integration with comprehensive farm management ecosystems\n**🔧 IoT Learning:** Educational platform for weather-based automation development\n**🌍 Environmental Research:** Combining meteorological data with livestock care protocols\n\n## 📊 Rich Output Examples\n\nThe workflow generates detailed Telegram reports featuring:\n- **Current Weather Analysis:** 6-hour and 12-hour rain probability breakdowns\n- **Feeding Decision Logic:** Clear rationale for feed adjustments with percentages\n- **Hardware Confirmation:** ESP8266 response status and command execution verification  \n- **Schedule Preview:** Next automated feeding time with countdown\n- **Historical Logs:** Comprehensive activity tracking for pattern analysis\n\n## 🔧 Hardware Integration Guide\n\nDesigned for ESP8266-based feeders accepting HTTP POST commands. The workflow transmits structured JSON containing:\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"FEED_REDUCE_20\",\n  \"feed_ratio\": -20,\n  \"rain_prob\": 75,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-09-18T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"location\": \"Main Pond\"\n}\n```\n\n## 🌍 Regional Adaptation\n\n**Indonesia-Optimized:** Built specifically for BMKG's official weather API with ADM4 regional precision\n**Global Compatibility:** Easily adaptable for international weather services by modifying HTTP requests and parsing logic\n**Scalable Architecture:** Supports multiple pond locations with separate ADM4 configurations\n\n## 🔒 Security & Credentials\n\n- All API keys use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` format for secure credential management\n- No hardcoded sensitive information in workflow nodes\n- Telegram bot tokens managed through n8n's credential system\n- ESP8266 webhooks support local network security\n\n## 📈 Performance Benefits\n\n- **20% Feed Optimization:** Automatic reduction during high rain probability periods\n- **Water Quality Protection:** Prevents overfeeding that degrades aquatic environment  \n- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces feed waste while maintaining fish health\n- **24/7 Monitoring:** Continuous weather analysis without manual intervention\n- **Scalable Operations:** Supports multiple feeding locations from single workflow\n\n---",
