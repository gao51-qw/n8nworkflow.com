    "description": "This n8n workflow automates the creation of high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts using AI. It pulls keyword data from Google Sheets, conducts research via Perplexity AI, generates structured content (title, introduction, key takeaways, body, conclusion, and FAQs) with OpenAI and Anthropic models, assembles the post, performs final edits, converts to HTML, and publishes directly to WordPress. Ideal for content marketers, bloggers, or agencies looking to scale content production while maintaining relevance and engagement.\nKey Features\n\nKeyword-Driven Generation: Fetches primary keywords, search intent, and related terms from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to inform content strategy.\nAI Research & Structuring: Uses Perplexity for in-depth topic research and OpenAI/Anthropic for semantic analysis, outlines, and full content drafting.\nModular Content Creation: Generates sections like introductions, key takeaways, outlines, body, conclusions, and FAQs with tailored prompts for tone, style, and SEO.\nAssembly & Editing: Combines sections into a cohesive Markdown post, adds internal/external links, and applies final refinements for readability and flow.\nPublishing Automation: Converts Markdown to styled HTML and posts drafts to WordPress.\nCustomization Points: Easily adjust AI prompts, research depth, or output formats via Code and Set nodes.\n\nRequirements\n\nCredentials: OpenAI API (for GPT models), Perplexity API (for research), Google Sheets OAuth2 (for keyword input), WordPress API (for publishing).\nSetup: Configure your Google Sheets with columns like \"keyword\", \"search intent\", \"related keyword\", etc. Ensure the sheet is shared with your Google account.\nDependencies: No additional packages needed; relies on n8n's built-in nodes for AI, HTTP, and data processing.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTrigger & Input: Start manually or schedule; pulls keyword data from Google Sheets.\nResearch Phase: Uses Perplexity to gather topic insights and citations from reputable sources.\nContent Generation: AI nodes create title, structure, intro, takeaways, outline, body, conclusion, and FAQs based on research and SEO guidelines.\nAssembly & Refinement: Merges sections, embeds links, edits for polish, and converts to HTML.\nOutput: Publishes as a WordPress draft or outputs the final HTML for manual use.\n\nBenefits\n\nTime Savings: Automate 80-90% of content creation, reducing manual writing from hours to minutes.\nSEO Optimization: Incorporates primary/related keywords naturally, aligns with search intent, and includes semantic structures for better rankings.\nScalability: Process multiple keywords in batches; perfect for content calendars or high-volume blogging.\nQuality Assurance: Built-in editing ensures engaging, error-free content with real-world examples and data-backed insights.\nVersatility: Adaptable for any niche (e.g., marketing, tech, finance) by tweaking prompts or sheets.\n\nPotential Customizations\n\nAdd more AI models (e.g., via custom nodes) for varied tones.\nIntegrate image generation or social sharing for full content pipelines.\nFilter sheets for specific topics or add notifications on completion.",

Your goal is to summarize the key takeaways, reinforce the article’s value, and leave the reader with a lasting impression.\n\nGuidelines for Generating the Conclusion:\n\n✅ Summarize Key Takeaways Without Repetition\n\nIdentify the most essential points from the article without repeating entire sentences from the main body.\n\nHighlight core insights, trends, or findings in a concise manner.\n\n✅ Reinforce the Article’s Value & Relevance\n\nEmphasize why the information matters in the broader context of the topic.\n\nAlign with the article’s purpose—whether it’s to educate, inform, persuade, or provide solutions.\n\n✅ Deliver a Strong Final Thought\n\nEnd with a compelling, forward-looking, or actionable statement.\n\nConsider:\n\nA thought-provoking question\n\nA call to action (if relevant)\n\nA statement on future implications or ongoing developments\n\nAvoid generic phrases (e.g., “This is just the beginning” or “The future looks bright”).\n\nFormatting & Style:\n\nKeep it concise—the conclusion should be around 100-150 words.\n\nUse clear, authoritative, and engaging language.\n\nAdapt tone and style to match the article (technical, business, educational, etc.).\n\nInput:\n\nThe main body of the article (excluding introduction & key takeaways)\n\nThe article's title (for context)\n\nOutput:A well-structured conclusion that effectively summarizes key points, reinforces relevance, and ends with a compelling thought.\n\nExample Conclusion for a Business Article\n\n(Title: \"The Rise of Agentic AI in Workflow Automation\")\n\nAs businesses seek greater efficiency and adaptability, agentic AI automation is emerging as a transformative force in workflow management. By reducing cognitive load, managing complexity, and enabling continuous improvement, these systems empower organizations to operate with unprecedented precision and scalability.\n\nHowever, successful implementation requires a strategic approach—ensuring seamless integration, robust governance, and continuous refinement. Organizations that embrace this shift will gain a significant competitive edge, optimizing operations while driving innovation.\n\nFor businesses evaluating their automation strategies, the key question is no longer if agentic AI will play a role—but how soon they will adopt it to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nExample Conclusion for a Consumer Guide\n\n(Title: \"How to Choose the Best Electric Bike for Your Needs\")\n\nChoosing the right electric bike depends on your lifestyle, terrain, and riding preferences. Whether you need a powerful e-bike for commuting or a lightweight model for weekend adventures, understanding motor types, battery life, and key features ensures a smarter purchase.\n\nBy evaluating your specific needs and budget, you can invest in an e-bike that enhances both convenience and sustainability. As technology continues to improve, e-bikes are becoming more affordable, efficient, and accessible—making now an excellent time to explore your options.\n\nBefore making a final decision, test ride different models, compare specifications, and consider long-term factors like maintenance and warranty coverage. The right e-bike isn’t just about performance—it’s about finding the perfect balance between comfort, power, and practicality for your everyday life.\n\nOutput Requirements\nFormat the output in Markdown using ## for the conclusion heading.\nDo not include triple backticks (''') or any additional spaces or text outside of the conclusion itself.\nEnsure clean and structured formatting without unnecessary dividers or extra line breaks."

Tone & Style\n- Match the desired tone and writing style based on the topic:\n  - Business or technical content → Professional, informative, and authoritative.\n  - Consumer, travel, or lifestyle → Conversational, engaging, and experience-driven.\n- Use clear, concise sentences while maintaining depth and insight.\n\n4. Use of Hidden Insight\n- If a hidden insight is included and enhances the section's argument, weave it in organically.\n- If the insight is not relevant to the section’s context, omit it.\n\n5. Real-World Value\n- Where appropriate, include:\n  - Practical examples or case studies\n  - Steps, tips, comparisons, or expert insights\n  - Clarifying analogies or metaphors\n\n6.

The final article should be well-structured, engaging, and adaptable to any topic, including (but not limited to) business, healthcare, technology, education, finance, environmental science, legal, consumer guides, and marketing.\n\n✅ General Refinement Guidelines\n\n1️⃣ Expand, Don’t Cut\nPreserve all valuable content while adding depth where necessary.\nDo not shorten or remove sections unless redundant or unclear.\nIf something feels incomplete, expand rather than delete it.\n\n2️⃣ Strengthen Section Transitions for Seamless Flow\nEnsure smooth transitions between sections by adding brief lead-ins before introducing a new concept.\nEach section should naturally build on the previous one—avoiding abrupt shifts.\nImplementation:\nIf a new section introduces a major topic, insert a transition sentence summarizing why the previous section matters.\nExample:\nBefore: \"While automation improves efficiency, its true power emerges when integrated with existing systems.\"\nAfter: \"Efficiency gains are only part of the equation—true business impact comes from seamlessly integrating automation with existing workflows to ensure sustainable improvements.\"\n\n3️⃣ Diversify Real-World Applications Across More Industries\nDo NOT over-focus on one industry or domain (e.g., AI, tech, or automation).\nWhere applicable, ensure varied examples in fields like:\n\nHealthcare (diagnostic automation, patient management)\n\nFinance (risk assessment, fraud detection, portfolio management)\n\nEducation (personalized learning, curriculum adaptation)\n\nLegal (contract automation, compliance monitoring)\n\nMarketing (data-driven campaigns, customer behavior analysis)\n\nRetail & E-commerce (inventory optimization, demand forecasting)\n\nConsumer Behavior (product recommendations, pricing strategies)\n\nEnvironmental Science (climate impact modeling, resource allocation)\nImplementation:\nIf the article lacks industry diversity, add 1–2 additional sector applications.\nExample:\nBefore: \"Predictive analytics is transforming logistics and finance.\"\nAfter: \"Predictive analytics is transforming industries beyond logistics and finance. In healthcare, it enhances diagnostic accuracy; in education, it customizes learning paths; in marketing, it optimizes ad spend by predicting customer behavior.\"\n\n4️⃣ Strengthen the Conclusion with a Future-Focused Perspective\nAvoid generic wrap-ups—end with a compelling strategic takeaway or challenge.\nEnsure future trends, competitive implications, and thought-provoking insights are included.\nExample:\nBefore: \"The question remains: How will businesses use this technology to redefine operations? The time to act is now.\"\nAfter: \"Looking ahead, businesses that embrace adaptable strategies and data-driven decision-making will lead in an increasingly competitive landscape. Whether through emerging technologies, customer-first innovation, or operational agility, the next era of success will belong to those who can not just adapt—but anticipate change. The real question isn’t if you’ll adopt these advancements—but how effectively you’ll use them to gain a competitive edge.\"\n\n5️⃣ Expand Instead of Reduce Content\nDo not cut content unless it is redundant or weakens clarity.\nIf a section feels too brief or lacks depth, expand it by:\n\nProviding real-world examples\n\nAdding practical applications\n\nElaborating on key insights\n\nStrengthening data-backed statements\n\nExample:\nBefore: \"Sustainable practices benefit businesses.\"\nAfter: \"Sustainable practices provide both environmental and financial advantages. Businesses that invest in renewable energy, reduce waste, and optimize resource consumption see long-term cost savings and increased brand loyalty.\"\n\n6️⃣ Internal and External Linking Optimization\nEmbed both internal and external links strategically to enhance SEO and reader experience:\n\nInternal Links: Link relevant keywords or phrases to other articles, guides, or resources within the same website. Prioritize linking to cornerstone content and related in-depth resources to guide users deeper into the site.\n\nExternal Links: Link authoritative, reputable sources to support facts, statistics, and claims. Prefer .gov, .edu, and high-authority .com sites in the relevant industry.\n\nEnsure links are naturally embedded within sentences rather than placed awkwardly.\n\nUse descriptive anchor text (e.g., “AI automation case studies” instead of “click here”).\n\nAvoid overlinking—balance SEO benefits with readability.\n\n7️⃣ Do Not Add Commentary on What Was Improved\nOnly output the refined final article without explanations.\n\n8️⃣ No Unnecessary Formatting Changes\nDo not insert horizontal lines, extra blank lines, or irrelevant styling changes.\n\n"
