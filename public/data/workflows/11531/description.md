# Auto-Send DMs to LinkedIn Commenters Who Type a Specific Keyword using ConnectSafely.AI API

## Who's it for

This workflow is built for content creators, coaches, course sellers, and marketers who use the "comment X to get the link" engagement strategy on LinkedIn. Perfect for anyone who wants to deliver lead magnets, code samples, templates, or resources automatically without spending hours manually DMing every commenter.

If you're tired of the manual grind—reading comments, checking connections, copy-pasting messages—this automation handles the entire fulfillment process while you focus on creating more content. Works especially well for viral posts where comment volume makes manual responses impossible.

## How it works

The workflow monitors your LinkedIn post for specific keyword triggers and automatically sends personalized DMs to commenters who request your content.

**The process flow:**
1. You submit your post URL, trigger keyword, and resource link via a simple form
2. Fetches all comments from the specified LinkedIn post via ConnectSafely.ai API
3. Loops through each comment individually for processing
4. Detects if the comment contains your trigger keyword (case-insensitive)
5. Checks if the commenter is a 1st-degree connection (required for DMs)
6. Sends a personalized direct message with their name and your resource link
7. Applies random rate limiting (15-30 minutes) between messages for account safety
8. Continues until all matching comments are processed

The rate limiting and connection checks are built-in to protect your LinkedIn account from automation detection.

2. Log into your dashboard
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
4. Generate a new API key and copy it

#### Add Credential in n8n

1. Go to **Credentials** in n8n
2. Click **Add Credential** → Search for **ConnectSafely API**
3. Paste your API key
4. Save the credential

This credential is used by all ConnectSafely nodes in the workflow.


### Step 2: Connect Your LinkedIn Account

1. In your ConnectSafely.ai dashboard, click **Connect LinkedIn**
2. Follow the authorization flow
3. Ensure your account shows as "Connected" with a green status
4. Your LinkedIn is now accessible via the API


### Step 3: Import and Configure the Workflow

1. Download the workflow JSON file
2. In n8n, go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
3. Select the downloaded JSON
4. Open each ConnectSafely node and select your credential from the dropdown


### Step 4: Test the Workflow

1. Click the **Test Workflow** button in n8n
2. Copy the form URL that appears in the Form Trigger node
3. Open the URL in a new browser tab
4. Fill in the form:
   - **LinkedIn Post URL**: Full URL of your post with comments
   - **Trigger Keyword**: The word commenters type (e.g., "code", "link", "example")
   - **Content Link**: The URL you want to send them
   - **Your Name**: For the message signature
5. Submit and watch the execution

**Pro Tip**: Test with your own post first where you've left a test comment containing the keyword.


### Step 5: Activate for Production

1. Review the test execution to ensure messages sent correctly
2. Toggle the workflow to **Active**
3. Use the form URL whenever you post new "comment for link" content
4. The workflow processes comments and sends DMs automatically

## Customization

### Message Template

Edit the **Send DM with Link** node to customize your message:

```
Hey {{name}}! 👋

Thanks for your comment on my post!

As promised, here's the link you requested:
👉 {{link}}

If you have any questions or want more resources like this, just let me know!

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Variables available:**
- `{{ $('Loop: Process Each Comment').item.json.authorName }}` - Commenter's name
- `{{ $('Form: Enter Post Details').item.json['Content Link to Send'] }}` - Your resource link
- `{{ $('Form: Enter Post Details').item.json['Your Name (for signature)'] }}` - Your name


### Multiple Keywords

Edit the **Detect Keyword Match** code node to check for multiple trigger words:

```javascript
// Multiple keyword detection
const keywords = ['code', 'example', 'template', 'link', 'send'];
const commentLower = commentText.toLowerCase();

const isMatch = keywords.some(keyword =&gt; 
  commentLower.includes(keyword.toLowerCase())
);

return [{ json: { isKeywordMatch: isMatch, commentText } }];
```


### Rate Limiting Adjustment

Edit the **Wait: Rate Limiting** node to change delays:

| Risk Level | Wait Time | Formula |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 🟢 Safest | 30-60 min | `Math.floor(Math.random() * (3600 - 1800 + 1)) + 1800` |
| 🟡 Moderate (Default) | 15-30 min | `Math.floor(Math.random() * (1800 - 900 + 1)) + 900` |
| 🔴 Faster (Risky) | 5-15 min | `Math.floor(Math.random() * (900 - 300 + 1)) + 300` |

**Warning**: Shorter delays increase the risk of LinkedIn flagging your account.


### Add Connection Requests (Optional)

To also send connection requests to non-connected commenters:

1. Add a **ConnectSafely LinkedIn** node after the "If: Connected?" FALSE path
2. Set operation to `sendConnectionRequest`
3. Map the `publicIdentifier` from the loop
4. Add a personalized connection message

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: No comments returned from post
- **Solution**: Verify the post URL is correct and complete (should include the full linkedin.com/posts/... URL)
- **Solution**: Ensure the post is public or you're the post author
- **Solution**: Check that the post actually has comments

**Issue**: "Cannot send message" errors
- **Solution**: You can only DM 1st-degree connections on LinkedIn; non-connections are automatically skipped
- **Solution**: The commenter may have messaging disabled in their settings

**Issue**: Messages not being sent
- **Solution**: Verify your ConnectSafely.ai credentials are valid and connected
- **Solution**: Check that your LinkedIn account is properly connected in ConnectSafely dashboard
- **Solution**: Review the execution log for specific error messages

**Issue**: Keyword not matching comments
- **Solution**: Keywords are case-insensitive, but check spelling
- **Solution**: Ensure the keyword appears exactly in the comment (partial matches work)
- **Solution**: Test with a simple, unique keyword first

**Issue**: Workflow seems slow
- **Solution**: This is intentional! The 15-30 minute delays between messages protect your account
- **Solution**: Large batches (50+ comments) will take several hours to complete safely

**Issue**: LinkedIn account warnings
- **Solution**: Stop the workflow immediately
- **Solution**: Wait 24-48 hours before resuming
- **Solution**: Increase rate limiting delays when you restart
- **Solution**: Reduce daily volume

**Issue**: Duplicate messages sent
- **Solution**: Don't run the workflow multiple times on the same post
- **Solution**: Consider adding a Google Sheets node to track processed commenters

## Safety Best Practices

### LinkedIn Account Protection

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|---------|

| Process 20-30 comments per batch | Process 100+ comments at once |
| Run during business hours | Run 24/7 continuously |
| Stop if you see warnings | Ignore LinkedIn restrictions |
| Keep messages helpful | Send salesy/spammy content |
| Respond to genuine requests | Use for cold outreach |

### Daily Limits (Approximate)

| Account Type | Recommended Max DMs/Day |
|--------------|------------------------|
