### **N8N Workflow: Printify Automation - Update Title and Description - AlexK1919**

This workflow automates the process of getting products from Printify, generating new titles and descriptions using OpenAI, and updating those products.

#### **How it Works**

This workflow automatically retrieves a list of products from a Printify store, processes them to generate new titles and descriptions based on brand guidelines and custom instructions, and then updates the products on Printify with the new information. It also interacts with Google Sheets to track the status of the products being processed. The workflow can be triggered both manually or by an update in a Google Sheet.

#### **Use Cases**

- **E-commerce Automation**: Automating content updates for a Printify store.

- **Marketing & SEO**: Generating SEO-friendly or seasonal content for products using AI.

- **Product Management**: Batch-updating product titles and descriptions without manual effort.

#### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Printify API Credentials**: Set up httpHeaderAuth credentials for Printify to allow the workflow to get and update products.

2. **OpenAI API Credentials**: Provide an API key for OpenAI in the openAiApi credentials.

3. **Google Sheets Credentials**: The workflow requires two separate Google Sheets credentials: one for the trigger (googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api) and another for appending/updating data (googleSheetsOAuth2Api).

4. **Google Sheets Setup**: You need a Google Sheet to store product information and track the status of the updates. The workflow is linked to a specific spreadsheet.

5. **Brand Guidelines**: The **Brand Guidelines + Custom Instructions** node must be updated with your specific brand details and any custom instructions for the AI.

#### **Workflow Logic**

1. **Trigger**: The workflow can be triggered manually or by an update in a Google Sheet when the upload column is changed to "yes".

2. **Get Product Info**: It fetches the shop ID and then a list of all products from Printify.

3. **Process Products**: The product data is split, and the workflow loops through each product.

4. **AI Content Generation**: For each product, the **Generate Title and Desc** node uses OpenAI to create a new title and description based on the original content, brand guidelines, and custom instructions.

5. **Google Sheets Update**: The workflow appends the product information and a "Product Processing" status to a Google Sheet. It then updates the row with the newly generated title and description, and changes the status to "Option added".

6. **Printify Update**: The **Printify - Update Product** node sends a PUT request to the Printify API to apply the new title and description to the product.
