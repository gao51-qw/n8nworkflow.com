By the end, you'll have a fully automated system for managing your recruitment pipeline.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works: The Workflow Explained\n\nThis workflow is designed in three logical phases to handle the entire post-interview process automatically.\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Trigger & Feedback Loop**:\n    * The workflow **triggers** when an interview ends on your Google Calendar.\n    * It immediately sends a **Slack message** to the interviewer with a link to the feedback form.\n    * After a 2-hour **wait**, it checks if the feedback has been submitted. If not, it sends a **reminder**.\n    * Once feedback is received, it logs the data in **Airtable** and uses an **If node** to determine if the candidate has passed or failed.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Automated Communication**:\n    * Based on the candidate's status, the workflow sends a personalized and professional email using **Gmail**.\n    * For candidates who pass, it sends a follow-up invitation. For those who don't, it sends a polite rejection email crafted by a **Code node**.\n    * If a candidate is in the final stage and passes, the workflow automatically generates and sends an offer letter for signature via **DocuSign**.\n\n3.  **Phase 3: Onboarding & Reporting**:\n    * Once a candidate accepts the offer (by signing the document), the workflow is triggered to create a new task list in **Trello** for the HR team.\n    * It sends a personalized welcome email to the new hire and a notification to the team on **Slack**.\n    * Finally, a **Cron Trigger** runs every Friday to collect all candidate data, calculate key recruitment metrics, log them in **Google Sheets**, and send a summary report to your team on **Slack**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup Guide\n\nFollow these steps to configure the workflow in your n8n instance.\n\n### **Step 1: Prerequisites**\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following accounts and a workspace set up:\n* n8n\n* Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Gmail\n* Airtable\n* Slack\n* Trello\n* DocuSign\n\n### **Step 2: Database & Form Preparation**\n1.  **Airtable:** Create a new Airtable base with two tables:\n    * **Candidates Table**: Create columns for `Candidate Name`, `Email`, `Interviewer ID`, `Interview Date`, and `Status`.\n    * **Feedback Table**: Create columns for `Candidate Name`, `Overall Score`, and `Comments`.\n2.  **Feedback Form:** Create a feedback form (e.g., using Google Forms or Typeform) that collects the candidate's name, the interviewer's name, and a score/comments.\n\n### **Step 3: Import the Workflow**\n1.  In your n8n instance, click **\"New\"** and select **\"Import from File\"**.\n2.  Import the `.json` file you purchased. The entire workflow, with all nodes, will appear on your canvas.\n\n### **Step 4: Configure Credentials**\n1.  Click on any node with a red **\"!\"** icon (e.g., the `Google Calendar Trigger` or `Slack` node).\n2.  In the right-hand panel, click **\"Create new credential\"**.\n3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to connect your accounts.\n4.  Repeat this process for all nodes that require credentials.\n\n### **Step 5: Node-Specific Configuration**\n\nNow, let's configure the specific details for each node to ensure it works for your company.\n\n1.  **Google Calendar Trigger**:\n    * Click on the node and in the `Calendar ID` field, enter the ID of the calendar you use for scheduling interviews.\n\n2.  **Airtable Nodes**:\n    * For every Airtable node in the workflow, enter the correct `Base ID` and `Table Name` (`Candidates` or `Feedback`) that you created in Step 2.\n\n3.  **Trello Node**:\n    * Enter the `Board ID` and the specific `List ID` where you want new onboarding tasks to be created.\n\n4.  **Gmail Nodes**:\n    * Customize the `Subject` and `HTML Body` of the emails to match your company's tone and branding.\n\n5.  **DocuSign Node**:\n    * Enter your `Account ID` and the `Template ID` for your offer letter.\n    * Ensure your offer letter template includes the `anchorString` (e.g., `/s1/`) that the workflow uses to place the signature tag.\n\n6.  **Environment Variables**:\n    * In your n8n settings, go to `Environment Variables` and add the following:\n        * `FEEDBACK_FORM_URL`: The URL of your feedback form.\n        * `SCHEDULING_LINK`: The URL for candidates to schedule their next interview.\n        * `REPORTS_DASHBOARD_URL`: A link to your Google Sheets report or a separate dashboard.\n\n### **Step 6: Final Step - Activating the Workflow**\n1.  Once all nodes are configured, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Click the **\"Active\"** toggle in the top right corner. The workflow is now live!\n3.  **Final Tip:** It's a good practice to test the system once by creating a test interview event on your calendar to ensure all steps run as expected.",
