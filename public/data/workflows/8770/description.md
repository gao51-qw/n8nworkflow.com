## 📖 Description  

### 🔹 How it works  
This workflow uses **AI (Mistral LLM + Pollinations.ai)** to generate **high-quality visual content for social media campaigns**. It automates the process from **brand/campaign input** to **final image upload**, ensuring consistency and relevance.

1. **Input Brand & Campaign Data**  
   - Retrieves brand profile and campaign goals from Google Drive.  
   - Cleans and merges the data into a structured JSON format.  

2. **Campaign Goal Generation**  
   - AI summarizes campaign goals, audience, success metrics, and keywords.  
   - Produces a clear **campaign goal summary** for content planning.  

3. **Image Prompt Generation**  
   - AI creates **5 detailed image prompts** reflecting the campaign story.  
   - Includes **1 caption** and **4–6 relevant hashtags**.  

4. **Image Creation**  
   - Pollinations.ai generates images based on the AI prompts.  
   - Each image is renamed systematically (photo1 → photo5).  

5. **Post-Processing & Upload**  
   - All images are merged into a single item.  
   - Workflow uploads the final output to Google Drive for campaign use.
