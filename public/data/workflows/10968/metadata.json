I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of the startup [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).\n\nI created this workflow for my mother, who is currently learning English, to turn the **BBC 6 Minute English** podcast into ready-to-use English lessons.\n\n[![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-20.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKugAVZWgKM)\n\nThe lesson includes vocabulary, exercises and discussion questions along with links to access the podcast content (audio and transcript).\n\n&gt; Use this assistant to automatically share English lessons from a renowned podcast.\n\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis template is designed for:\n\n- **ESL teachers** who want a fresh, structured lesson every week from real-life audio\n- **Independent learners** who want a guided way to study English with podcasts\n- **Language schools or content creators** who send regular English lessons by email\n\n### What does this workflow do?\n\nThis workflow acts as an **AI-powered English lesson generator** from podcast episodes.\n\n1. **Runs every Sunday at 20:00** using a Schedule Trigger and reads the BBC **6 Minute English** RSS feed  \n2. **Checks a Data Table of archived episodes** and filters out those already sent (using their `guid`)  \n3. **Keeps the latest unsent episode** and loads its web page content via HTTP  \n4. **Parses the HTML** in a Code node to extract the episode **description**, full **transcript** and BBC **vocabulary list**  \n5. **Calls three AI nodes** (OpenAI) to generate:\n   - a motivational **email hook message**\n   - **fill-in-the-blank vocabulary exercises**\n   - **discussion questions** related to the topic  \n6. **Combines all vocabulary words** and sends them to **ElevenLabs** to generate a slow-paced audio track for listening practice  \n7. **Builds a prettify HTML email** that includes: title, description, hook, vocabulary list, exercises, discussion questions and resource links  \n8. **Sends the final lesson by email** via the Gmail node, with the vocabulary audio attached  \n\nFor example, this is the latest email generated by the workflow:\n\n[![Email Screenshot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-19.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKugAVZWgKM)\n\n*P.S.: You can customise the footer to your school or company identity.*\n\n### 🎥 Tutorial\n\nI advise you to check the tutorial on my YouTube channel for the details on how to set up the nodes and customise the content:\n\n[![Tutorial + Demo](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-22.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKugAVZWgKM)\n\n### Next Steps\n\nFollow the stickers to set up all the nodes:\n\n- Replace the **Data Table** reference with your own (storing at least `guid`, `title`, `link`, `processed_date`)  \n- Set up your **OpenAI** credentials in the three Model nodes  \n- Set up your **ElevenLabs** credentials and choose a voice in the audio node  \n- Configure your **Gmail** credentials and recipient email address in the Send Email node  \n- Adapt the **RSS feed URL** if you want to track another podcast or source  \n- Customise the **HTML email** (colours, logo, footer text) in the `Prepare Email` Code node  \n- Adjust the **schedule** (time or frequency) if you prefer another cadence  \n\n*Submitted: 18 November 2025*  \n*Template designed with n8n version 1.116.2*\n",
