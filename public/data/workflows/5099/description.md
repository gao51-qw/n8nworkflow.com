# AI-Powered Job Application Screening Workflow

## Who Is This For?

This template is ideal for:
- **HR teams**
- **Recruiters**
- **Hiring managers**

Who want to automate the screening of job applicants. If you collect candidate data via JotForm and want an AI‑powered, multi‑source evaluation—without manual copy‑paste—this workflow is for you.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Manually reviewing:
- LinkedIn profiles
- GitHub repos
- LeetCode stats
- Resume PDFs

Is **time‑consuming** and **error‑prone**. This workflow:
1. Centralizes all candidate data
2. Scores each dimension against specific job requirements
3. Appends results to Google Sheets
4. Helps make data‑driven hiring decisions faster

## What This Workflow Does

### 1. Trigger on New JotForm Submission
Captures candidate name, email, social URLs, resume link, and **job description**  
*(Pro Tip: Add hidden field in JotForm to pass job requirements)*

### 2. Extract & Normalize Usernames
Parses LinkedIn, GitHub, and LeetCode handles

### 3. Scrape & Format Data
- **LinkedIn** → profile & latest posts via ScrapingDog & Apify
- **GitHub** → profile, repos, and contribution metrics via GitHub GraphQL
- **LeetCode** → submission stats & rankings via LeetCode GraphQL
- **Resume** → converts PDF to text with PDF.co

### 4. AI‑Powered Evaluation
Uses LangChain agents on OpenRouter to:
- Generate fit scores (1–10) **based on job description**
- Provide justifications for each source
- Analyze candidate suitability against specific role requirements

### 5. Merge & Append
Consolidates scores and feedback → writes new row to Google Sheets with hyperlinks and totals

## Setup

### JotForm Configuration
1. Create your job application form
2. **Add Hidden Field**:
   - Name: `job_description`
   - Value: [Paste full job description here]
   *(This enables AI to evaluate candidates against specific role requirements)*
3. Create fields matching the workflow requirements
