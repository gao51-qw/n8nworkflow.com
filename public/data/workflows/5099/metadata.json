If you collect candidate data via JotForm and want an AI‑powered, multi‑source evaluation—without manual copy‑paste—this workflow is for you.\n\n## What Problem Does This Solve?\n\nManually reviewing:\n- LinkedIn profiles\n- GitHub repos\n- LeetCode stats\n- Resume PDFs\n\nIs **time‑consuming** and **error‑prone**. This workflow:\n1. Centralizes all candidate data\n2. Scores each dimension against specific job requirements\n3. Appends results to Google Sheets\n4. Helps make data‑driven hiring decisions faster\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\n### 1. Trigger on New JotForm Submission\nCaptures candidate name, email, social URLs, resume link, and **job description**  \n*(Pro Tip: Add hidden field in JotForm to pass job requirements)*\n\n### 2. Extract & Normalize Usernames\nParses LinkedIn, GitHub, and LeetCode handles\n\n### 3. Scrape & Format Data\n- **LinkedIn** → profile & latest posts via ScrapingDog & Apify\n- **GitHub** → profile, repos, and contribution metrics via GitHub GraphQL\n- **LeetCode** → submission stats & rankings via LeetCode GraphQL\n- **Resume** → converts PDF to text with PDF.co\n\n### 4. AI‑Powered Evaluation\nUses LangChain agents on OpenRouter to:\n- Generate fit scores (1–10) **based on job description**\n- Provide justifications for each source\n- Analyze candidate suitability against specific role requirements\n\n### 5. Merge & Append\nConsolidates scores and feedback → writes new row to Google Sheets with hyperlinks and totals\n\n## Setup\n\n### JotForm Configuration\n1. Create your job application form\n2. **Add Hidden Field**:\n   - Name: `job_description`\n   - Value: [Paste full job description here]\n   *(This enables AI to evaluate candidates against specific role requirements)*\n3. Create fields matching the workflow requirements\n![image.png](fileId:1592)\n\n### Required Credentials/Variables\n- JotForm API key\n- SCRAPINGDOG_API_KEY & Apify token\n- GitHub personal access token (read‑only)\n- PDF.co API key\n- OpenRouter API key\n\n### Configuration Steps\n1. **Google Sheets**\n   - Create or select spreadsheet\n   - Grant n8n access\n2. **Node Organization**\n   - All nodes renamed for clarity\n   - Sticky notes explain prerequisites\n\n## How to Customize\n\n### 1. Job-Specific Evaluation\n- Include hidden `job_description` field in JotForm\n- AI will automatically analyze candidates against these requirements\n\n### 2. Add/Edit Fields\nUse `Edit Fields` node to map your form questions\n\n### 3. Adjust Scoring\nTweak agent prompts:\n- `linkedin evaluation`\n- `github evaluation`\n- etc.\n\n### 4. Extend Sources\nInsert new branches (e.g., Stack Overflow) by following existing patterns\n\n## Result\n\nTransforms raw candidate submissions into actionable insights—evaluating applicants against specific job requirements and reducing screening time from hours to minutes with consistent, unbiased evaluations.",
