- Formats the data, aggregating it at the campaign, ad set, and ad levels
- Generates AI-driven analysis and insights on your results, providing actionable recommendations
- Renders the report as a visually appealing PDF with charts and tables
- Sends the report via Slack (you can also add email or WhatsApp)
