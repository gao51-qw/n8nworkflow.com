**Automate document translation and ensure translation accuracy using Straker Verify, Google Drive and Slack.**

**How it works? **
A workflow step is set up to "watch" a Google Drive folder. When your team members place new files in this folder, they are downloaded. Straker Verify then translates them and provides a quality score.

Once Straker Verify has completed this, the job info is fetched, the translation is saved to an output folder and you are notified via Slack.

**What problem does this solve?**
When using AI to translate documents, you have no idea about the quality and accuracy of the output. This template answers the question “How good is my translation?” so you have a high level of confidence before you publish.

**Who is this for?**
This workflow template is designed for businesses needing translation and localization of documents such as text docs, presentations, web pages, transcripts, video subtitles and others. Use it to build workflows that localize your content at scale while maintaining translation quality, accuracy and compliance.
