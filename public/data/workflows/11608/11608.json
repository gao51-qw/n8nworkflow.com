    "description": "# Product Price Monitor with Slack and Jira\n\n![Workflow Preview Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/4E79A7/FFFFFF?text=Product+Price+Monitor+Workflow+Preview)\n\n**⚠️ COMMUNITY TEMPLATE DISCLAIMER: This is a community-contributed template that uses ScrapeGraphAI (a community node). Please ensure you have the ScrapeGraphAI community node installed in your n8n instance before using this template.**\n\nThis workflow automatically scrapes multiple e-commerce sites, analyses weekly seasonal price trends, and notifies your team in Slack while opening Jira tickets for items that require price adjustments. It helps retailers plan inventory and pricing by surfacing actionable insights every week.\n\n## Pre-conditions/Requirements\n\n### Prerequisites\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n cloud)\n- ScrapeGraphAI community node installed\n- Slack workspace & channel for notifications\n- Jira Software project (cloud or server)\n- Basic JavaScript knowledge for optional custom code edits\n\n### Required Credentials\n- **ScrapeGraphAI API Key** – Enables web scraping\n- **Slack OAuth Access Token** – Required by the Slack node\n- **Jira Credentials** – Email & API token (cloud) or username & password (server)\n- (Optional) **Proxy credentials** – If target websites block direct scraping\n\n### Specific Setup Requirements\n| Resource | Purpose | Example |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| Product URL list | Seed URLs to monitor | `https://example.com/products-winter-sale` |\n| Slack Channel | Receives trend alerts | `#pricing-alerts` |\n| Jira Project Key | Tickets are created here | `ECOM` |\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically scrapes multiple e-commerce sites, analyses weekly seasonal price trends, and notifies your team in Slack while opening Jira tickets for items that require price adjustments. It helps retailers plan inventory and pricing by surfacing actionable insights every week.\n\n## Key Steps:\n- **Webhook Trigger**: Kicks off the workflow via a weekly schedule or manual call.\n- **Set Product URLs**: Prepares the list of product pages to analyse.\n- **SplitInBatches**: Processes URLs in manageable batches to avoid rate limits.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI**: Extracts current prices, stock, and seasonality hints from each URL.\n- **Code (Trend Logic)**: Compares scraped prices against historical averages.\n- **If (Threshold Check)**: Determines if price deviations exceed ±10%.\n- **Slack Node**: Sends a formatted message to the pricing channel for each deviation.\n- **Jira Node**: Creates/updates a ticket linking to the product for further action.\n- **Merge**: Collects all batch results for summary reporting.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup Time: 15-20 minutes**\n\n1. **Install Community Nodes**: In n8n, go to *Settings → Community Nodes*, search for “ScrapeGraphAI”, and install.\n2. **Add Credentials**:  \n   a. Slack → *Credentials* → *New*, paste your Bot/User OAuth token.  \n   b. Jira → *Credentials* → *New*, enter your domain, email/username, API token/password.  \n   c. ScrapeGraphAI → *Credentials* → *New*, paste your API key.\n3. **Import Workflow**: Upload or paste the JSON template into n8n.\n4. **Edit the “Set Product URLs” Node**: Replace placeholder URLs with your real product pages.\n5. **Configure Schedule**: Replace the Webhook Trigger with a Cron node (e.g., every Monday 09:00) or keep as webhook for manual runs.\n6. **Map Jira Fields**: In the Jira node, ensure *Project Key*, *Issue Type* (e.g., Task), and *Summary* fields match your instance.\n7. **Test Run**: Execute the workflow. Confirm Slack message appears and a Jira issue is created.\n8. **Activate**: Toggle the workflow to *Active* so it runs automatically.\n\n## Node Descriptions\n\n### Core Workflow Nodes:\n- **Webhook** – Default trigger, can be swapped with Cron for weekly automation.\n- **Set (Product URLs)** – Stores an array of product links for scraping.\n- **SplitInBatches** – Limits each ScrapeGraphAI call to five URLs to reduce load.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI** – Crawls and parses HTML, returning JSON with `title`, `price`, `availability`.\n- **Code (Trend Logic)** – Calculates percentage change vs. historical data (stored externally or hard-coded for demo).\n- **If (Threshold Check)** – Routes items above/below the set variance.\n- **Slack** – Posts a rich-format message containing product title, old vs. new price, and link.\n- **Jira** – Creates or updates a ticket with priority set to *Medium* and assigns to the *Pricing* team lead.\n- **Merge** – Recombines batch streams for optional reporting or storage.\n\n### Data Flow:\n1. **Webhook** → **Set (Product URLs)** → **SplitInBatches** → **ScrapeGraphAI** → **Code (Trend Logic)** → **If** → **Slack / Jira** → **Merge**\n\n## Customization Examples\n\n### Change Price Deviation Threshold\n```javascript\n// Code (Trend Logic) node\nconst threshold = 0.05; // 5% instead of default 10%\n```\n\n### Alter Slack Message Template\n```javascript\n{\n  \"text\": `*${item.name}* price changed from *$${item.old}* to *$${item.new}* (${item.diff}%).`,\n  \"attachments\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Product Link\",\n      \"title_link\": item.url,\n      \"color\": \"#4E79A7\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Data Output Format\n\nThe workflow outputs structured JSON data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"product\": \"Winter Jacket\",\n  \"url\": \"https://example.com/winter-jacket\",\n  \"oldPrice\": 129.99,\n  \"newPrice\": 99.99,\n  \"change\": -23.06,\n  \"scrapedAt\": \"2023-11-04T09:00:00Z\",\n  \"status\": \"Below Threshold\",\n  \"slackMsgId\": \"A1B2C3\",\n  \"jiraIssueKey\": \"ECOM-101\"\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ScrapeGraphAI returns empty data** – Verify selectors; many sites use dynamic rendering, require a headless browser flag.\n2. **Slack message not delivered** – Check that the OAuth token scopes include `chat:write`; also confirm channel ID.\n3. **Jira ticket creation fails** – Field mapping mismatch; ensure *Issue Type* is valid and required custom fields are supplied.\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Batch fewer URLs (e.g., 3 instead of 5) to reduce timeout risk.\n- Cache historical prices in an external DB (Postgres, Airtable) instead of reading large CSVs in the Code node.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Rotate proxies/IPs within ScrapeGraphAI to bypass aggressive e-commerce anti-bot measures.\n- Add a Notion or Sheets node after Merge for historical logging.\n- Use the *Error Trigger* workflow in n8n to alert when ScrapeGraphAI fails more than X times per run.",

When your external system posts a JSON body that contains a list of product URLs together with the prices you currently expect, the Webhook node starts the sequence. A short Code node validates the payload and converts every product entry into its own n8n item so downstream nodes can work in parallel. Each item is passed to ScrapeGraphAI, which loads the product page and extracts live information such as name, current price, currency, availability and seasonal tags. The original expected price is merged back in and a calculation node determines the percentage change. An IF node then checks whether the drop is larger than ten percent. Large drops immediately trigger a Slack alert, while normal changes are quietly written to Jira for later analysis and weekly reports.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. Add your ScrapeGraphAI API credentials in the scraper node  \n2. Connect your Slack account and select the alert channel  \n3. Connect your Jira cloud credentials and set the correct project key  \n4. Point your system or test tool to the webhook URL shown in the trigger  \n5. Send a sample payload with url and expectedPrice fields  \n6. Adjust the price-drop threshold in the IF node if necessary  \n7. Activate the workflow and monitor Slack for alerts"

The Webhook node listens on the /product-price-monitor path and accepts POST requests with a body shaped like `{ \"products\": [ { \"url\": \"…\", \"expectedPrice\": 19.99 } ] }`. A dedicated Code node immediately validates that structure, throwing a gentle but clear error if the caller forgets the products array or leaves it empty. Once validated, the same node flattens the array so that each product becomes its own item, adding both `url` and `expectedPrice` fields. Doing this transformation right at the perimeter means every downstream node can assume a clean, predictable shape, avoiding defensive checks later. Because all validation sits here, expanding the payload—perhaps with SKU, brand or campaign tags—only requires touching this single node, keeping maintenance low and future-proofing the workflow."

The SplitInBatches node allows us to throttle the rate at which we hit ScrapeGraphAI, protecting us from both platform limits and target-site bans. ScrapeGraphAI then renders the product page, processes dynamic content and returns a neat JSON bundle that includes name, live price, currency, availability and any seasonal keywords it can infer. Immediately afterwards a Merge node combines this fresh data with the original `expectedPrice` so we keep historical context. A small Code node converts the price string to a float, calculates the percentage delta and appends helper properties such as `priceChangePercent`. Grouping all enrichment here keeps later branches clean and makes it simple to slot in future calculations—think profit margin or competitor comparison—without touching alert or storage logic."

The IF node checks if `priceChangePercent` is smaller than ‑10, meaning the live price is at least ten percent lower than expected. Because the calculation happens earlier we only need a single numerical rule here, but you can extend the same node with additional conditions—maybe the `season` equals “Summer” or the product is marked as low stock. Isolating the logic in one node prevents alert fatigue and makes the workflow easy to tune without touching scraping or output code. Need a more nuanced policy? Just chain another IF node or switch to a Switch node while everything upstream and downstream continues to work untouched."

The lower branch quietly files every routine item as a Jira Task so analysts have a single place to review weekly patterns. Another Set node maps data into `summary` and `description` fields before the Jira node creates the issue inside the project key you specify. Because both branches draw from the same enriched dataset you can reroute either path—email, database, BI warehouse—without rewiring earlier sections. Keeping outputs together makes the end points obvious at a glance and simplifies maintenance."
