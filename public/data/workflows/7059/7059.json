    "description": "**Note:** This workflow assumes you already have your product’s Amazon reviews saved in a Google Sheet. If you still need those reviews, run my **Amazon Reviews Scraper** workflow first, then plug the resulting spreadsheet into this template.\n\n**What it does**\nTransforms any draft Google Doc into multiple high-converting sales pages. It blends Alex Hormozi’s value-stacking tactics with persona targeting based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, using your own customer reviews for proof and voice of customer (VOC).\n\n**Perfect for**\n• Growth and creative strategists\n• Freelance copywriters and agencies\n• Founders sharpening offers and funnels\n\n**Apps used**\nGoogle Sheets, Google Docs, LangChain OpenRouter LLM\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. Form Trigger collects Drive folder IDs, base copy URL and options.\n2. Workflow fetches the draft copy and product feature doc.\n3. It samples reviews, extracts VOC insights and maps them to Maslow needs.\n4. LLM drafts headlines and hooks following Hormozi’s \\$100M Offers principles.\n5. Personas drive tone, objections and urgency in each copy variant.\n6. Loop writes one Google Doc per variant in your chosen folder.\n7. Customer analysis docs are saved to a second folder for reuse.\n\n**Setup**\n\n1. Share two Drive folders, copy the IDs (text after `folders/`).\n2. Paste each ID into **Customer Analysis Folder ID** and **Advertorial Copy Folder ID**.\n3. Provide **File Name**, **Base copy (Google Docs URL)** and **Product Feature/USPs Doc**.\n4. Optional: **Reviews Sheet URL**, **Number of reviews to use**, **Target City**.\n5. Set **Number of Copies** you need (1–20).\n6. Add Google Docs OAuth2 and Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n.\n\n**If you have any questions in running the workflow, feel free to reach out to me at my youtube channel:**\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@lifeofhunyao",

            "text": "=You are a world-class advertorial copywriter and structural analyst.\n\nYou have access to two essential tools to enhance your execution:\n\n* **Think Tool** – Use this for structural reasoning, persuasion mapping, and emotional journey planning.\n\nYour objective is to craft a **high-converting listicle-style advertorial** for the product provided, strictly replicating the structure and persuasive logic of a successful reference advertorial.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Inputs\n\n**Product to Promote:**\n{{ $('On form submission').item.json['Product Name'] }}\n\n**Reference Advertorial Copy (Raw):**\n{{ $('Get Base Copy').item.json.content }}\n\n**Customer Insight Data:**\n{{ $('Review Insights').item.json['Marketing Angles'] }}\n{{ $('Review Insights').item.json['Customer Motivations'] }}\n{{ $('Review Insights').item.json['Voice of Customer (VOC) Snippets'] }}\n\n**Product Feature & USP Inputs:**\n{{ $('Get Product Features').item.json.content }}\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Objective\n\nGenerate a new advertorial by:\n\n1. **Strictly following the structure** defined in `structure_template`\n2. Leveraging customer motivations, friction points, barriers, product opportunities, and VOC language\n3. Matching the tone, copywriting techniques, and persuasive flow of the original reference\n4. Producing a polished, fully readable advertorial — **no placeholders allowed**\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Process Framework\n\n### 1. Structure Mapping\n\nUse the structure JSON to:\n\n* Define all sections and their order (e.g., headline, testimonials, benefit bullets, system steps, CTA)\n* Identify repeatable blocks and their required counts\n* Generate each section dynamically according to the structure\n\n### 2. Structure Alignment\n\nCompare `structure_template` with `raw_advertorial_text` to:\n\n* Understand how the structural blueprint maps to real copy\n* Mirror tone, flow, formatting, and pacing across each corresponding section\n\n### 3. Customer & Emotional Mapping\n\nBase your writing on:\n\n* **Marketing Angles** – Key framing and emotional anchors\n* **Customer Motivations** – What buyers desire or aspire to\n* **Friction & Barriers** – Common objections, doubts, and blockers\n* **Product Opportunities** – Features or benefits that exceed expectations\n* **VOC Snippets** – Real customer language that builds authenticity\n* **Testimonial Pool** – Verifiable third-party proof to reinforce credibility\n\n### 4. Copywriting Blueprint\n\n#### 🔹 Headline Sections\n\n* Combine \\[Product Name] + \\[Core Benefit/Outcome] + \\[Urgency or Social Proof]\n* Infuse headlines with VOC language wherever possible\n\n#### 🔹 Listicle / Reason Sections\n\nEach reason should include:\n\n* **Headline** – Motivation + Transformation\n* **Body (75–125 words):**\n\n  * Open with an emotional hook or relatable frustration\n  * Briefly address any objection or doubt\n  * Offer the solution via product benefits or USPs\n  * Incorporate direct language from the VOC snippets\n  * Conclude with a smooth lead-in to the next point\n\n#### 🔹 Repeatable Blocks\n\nUse `count` values from the structure JSON to populate:\n\n* Testimonials\n* System steps\n* FAQs\n* Feature bullets\n* Media mentions\n\nUse a variety of quotes and angles from the testimonial pool to avoid repetition and increase impact.\n\n#### 🔹 Call-to-Action Sections\n\n* Reaffirm the transformation or benefit\n* Layer in urgency, scarcity, or limited-time language\n* Offer risk reversal (e.g., money-back guarantee, free trial) if available\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Output Format\n\nThe final advertorial must follow the exact `structure_template` JSON schema:\n\n* Populate all required fields\n* Match all expected block counts and naming\n* Do not invent or omit any fields\n\nReturn your output as a complete JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Hero_Headline\": \"...\",\n  \"Hero_Subheadline\": \"...\",\n  \"Product_Name\": \"...\",\n  \"Customer_Testimonial_Headline_1\": \"...\",\n  \"Customer_Testimonial_Body_1\": \"...\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nEnsure all output is clean, compelling, and publication-ready.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Success Criteria\n\nA successful output should:\n\n* Mirror the reference structure exactly\n* Always ensure that the \"Product to Promote\" name that is provided as input is used. Never ever not hallucinate a random product name.\n* Speak with the authentic voice of the customer\n* Weave together storytelling, product value, and social proof seamlessly\n* Convert readers into buyers while maintaining clarity and structural fidelity\n",

No regrets.”\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Honor VOC Tactical Pains**\n\n* Mirror real friction points from `input_customer_analysis_json`, such as:\n\n  * “Too heavy” → “Lightweight design = no wrist pain”\n  * “Always gets tangled” → “Tangle-free tech means no snags ever”\n  * “Burnt my ear once” → “Safe-touch shell protects your skin”\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Bridge Features to Emotions**\n\n* Don’t just name features — explain how they serve the **emotional journey**\n\n  * “Auto-rotation” → “Curls itself, even if you’ve failed at hair your whole life”\n  * “Ionic tech” → “Smooth, shiny curls that hold all night — with zero frizz”\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Mirror Advertorial Style**\n\n* Use `input_advertorial_json` to match:\n\n  * Vocabulary (e.g. simple vs. luxe)\n  * Emotional temperature (e.g. punchy vs. aspirational)\n  * Persona perspective (e.g. millennial influencer, exhausted mom, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 📤 **Output Format**\n\nReturn **exactly one JSON object**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"headline_packages\": [\n    {\n      \"headline\": \"\",\n      \"subheadline\": \"\",\n      \"primary_lever\": \"\",   // \"Dream Outcome\", \"PLA\", \"Time Delay\", or \"Risk Removal\"\n      \"secondary_lever\": \"\"  // optional – another lever if combined\n    }\n    // 10–15 packages\n  ],\n  \"voice_notes\": \"\" // Describe the matched tone (e.g. \"Empowering, conversational tone for overwhelmed moms\")\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Rules**\n\n* 10–15 headline + subheadline packages\n* Every package must use **at least one Hormozi lever**\n* Ensure **all four levers** appear at least once across the set\n* **Headlines ≤ 14 words**, **Subheadlines ≤ 22 words**\n* Use **realistic numbers, timeframes, feature language, vivid outcomes**\n* **No fluff, no bullet points, no markdown – only the raw JSON**\n",

Persona Deep-Dive**\n- Extract: `maslow_category`, `core_fear_or_desire`, `struggles`, `current_state`, `quotes`\n- Understand: What drives this person's purchasing decision?\n\n**B. Headline Integration**\n- Ensure chosen headline connects persona's Maslow need with product positioning\n- Maintain headline promise throughout body copy\n\n**C. Framework Application**\n- Apply all 4 Hormozi levers specifically for this persona\n- Customize testimonials to mirror this persona's voice and concerns\n- Position features as solutions to this persona's specific problems\n\n**D.
