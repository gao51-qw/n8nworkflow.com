## Workflow Overview

- Only passes events with at least one external attendee

**Important Setup Note:** Replace `'explorium.ai'` in the code node with your company domain to properly filter internal meetings.

**Output:**
- Events with external participants only
- `external_attendees`: Array of external contact emails
- `company_domains`: Unique list of external company domains per meeting
