### 🚀 How It Works

• **Trigger & Script Magic**: Starts via Google Sheets webhook—AI crafts a punchy 213-223 character script (via Anthropic) for ~20-second shorts, ensuring viral potential.
• **Visuals on Autopilot**: Splits scenes, generates high-quality images with OpenAI, then animates them into videos using RunwayML's Gen3a Turbo.
• **Audio Layering**: Adds soothing background sounds and professional voice-overs (Adam voice) via ElevenLabs for that polished, immersive feel.
• **Final Polish & Upload**: Merges everything in Creatomate, slaps on captions with Replicate, uploads to Google Drive/YouTube, and updates your sheet—ready to post!

Setup takes 15-20 minutes with API keys. Plug-and-play: Import the JSON into n8n, and you're set—edit only API tokens and credentials as noted.
