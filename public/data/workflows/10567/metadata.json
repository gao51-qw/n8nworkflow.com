  "description": "## Overview\nThis n8n template automates the process of scraping job listings from Indeed, parsing the data into a structured format, and saving it to Google Sheets for easy tracking. It also includes a Slack notification system to alert you when new jobs are found.\n\nBuilt with **ScrapeOps**, it handles the complexities of web scraping - such as proxy rotation, anti-bot bypassing, and HTML parsing - so you can focus on the data.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Job Seekers**: Automate your daily job search and get instant alerts for new postings.\n- **Recruiters & HR Agencies**: Track hiring trends and find new leads for candidate placement.\n- **Sales & Marketing Teams**: Monitor companies that are hiring to identify growth signals and lead opportunities.\n- **Data Analysts**: Gather labor market data for research and competitive analysis.\n\n## What problems it solves\n- **Manual Searching**: Eliminates the need to manually refresh Indeed and copy-paste job details.\n- **Data Structure**: Converts messy HTML into clean, organized rows in a spreadsheet.\n- **Blocking & Captchas**: Uses ScrapeOps residential proxies to bypass Indeed's anti-bot protections reliably.\n- **Missed Opportunities**: Automated scheduling ensures you are the first to know about new listings.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs on a schedule (default: every 6 hours).\n2. **Configuration**: You define your search query (e.g., \"Software Engineer\") in the `Set Search URL` node.\n3. **Scraping**: The **ScrapeOps Proxy API** fetches the Indeed search results page using a residential proxy to avoid detection.\n4. **Parsing**: The **ScrapeOps Parser API** takes the raw HTML and extracts key details like Job Title, Company, Location, Salary, and URL.\n5. **Filtering**: A code node filters out invalid results and structures the data.\n6. **Storage**: Valid jobs are appended to a Google Sheet.\n7. **Notification**: A message is sent to Slack confirming the update.\n\n## Setup steps (~ 10-15 minutes)\n1. **ScrapeOps Account**:\n   - Register for a free [ScrapeOps API Key](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n).\n   - In n8n, open the **ScrapeOps** nodes and create a new credential with your API key.\n   \n2. **Google Sheets**:\n   - Duplicate this [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_ZMwAli50Bes9quxZtB37WE7S9HwlYOcj50bZzbOAM/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n   - Open the **Save to Google Sheets** node.\n   - Connect your Google account and select your duplicated sheet.\n   \n3. **Slack Setup**:\n   - Open the **Send a message** node.\n   - Connect your Slack account and select the channel where you want to receive alerts.\n\n4. **Customize Search**:\n   - Open the **Set Search URL** node.\n   - Update the `search_query` value to the job title or keyword you want to track.\n\n## Pre-conditions\n- An active [ScrapeOps account](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n) (Free tier available).\n- A Google Cloud account with Google Sheets API enabled (for n8n connection).\n- A Slack workspace for notifications.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis template uses ScrapeOps as a community node.
