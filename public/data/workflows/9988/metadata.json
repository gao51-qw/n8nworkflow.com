  "description": "## Automated Multi-Bank Balance Sync to BigQuery\n\nThis workflow automatically fetches balances from multiple financial institutions (RBC, Amex, Wise, PayPal) using Plaid, maps them to QuickBooks account names, and loads structured records into Google BigQuery for analytics.\n\n## Who’s it for?\nFinance teams, accountants, and data engineers managing consolidated bank reporting in Google BigQuery.\n\n## How it works\n1. The Schedule Trigger runs weekly.\n2. Four Plaid API calls fetch balances from RBC, Amex, Wise, and PayPal.\n3. Each response splits out individual accounts and maps them to QuickBooks names.\n4. All accounts are merged into one dataset.\n5. The workflow structures the account data, generates UUIDs, and formats SQL inserts.\n6. BigQuery node uploads the finalized records.\n\n## How to set up\nAdd Plaid and Google BigQuery credentials, replace client IDs and secrets with variables, test each connection, and schedule the trigger for your reporting cadence.\n",
