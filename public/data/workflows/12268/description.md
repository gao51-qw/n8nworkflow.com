## 📘 Description
This workflow automates the complete DPDP-aligned Consent Manager Registration screening pipeline — from intake to eligibility evaluation and final compliance routing.
Every incoming registration request is normalized, validated, logged, evaluated by an AI compliance engine (GPT-4o), and then routed into either approval or rejection flows.
It intelligently handles missing documentation (treated as a minor issue), evaluates financial/technical/operational capacity, generates structured eligibility JSON, updates registration records in Google Sheets, and sends outcome-specific emails to applicants and compliance teams.
 The workflow creates a full audit trail while reducing manual screening workload and ensuring consistent eligibility decisions.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)
▶️ Receive Consent Registration Event (Webhook)
 Collects incoming Consent Manager registration applications and triggers the processing pipeline.
🧹 Extract & Normalize Registration Payload (Code Node)
 Cleans the body payload and extracts key fields:
 action, organizationName, applicationType, contactEmail, netWorth, technicalCapacity, operationalCapacity, documentAttached, submittedAt.
🔍 Validate Registration Payload Structure (IF Node)
 Checks the presence of mandatory fields.
 Valid → continue to eligibility evaluation
 Invalid → log in the audit sheet.
📄 Log Invalid Registration Requests to Sheet (Google Sheets)
 Stores malformed or incomplete submissions for audit, follow-up, and retry handling.
📝 Write Initial Registration Entry to Sheet (Google Sheets)
 Creates the initial intake row in the master registration sheet before applying eligibility logic.
🧠 Configure GPT-4o — Eligibility Evaluation Model (Azure OpenAI)
 Prepares the AI model used to determine whether the applicant meets DPDP’s eligibility criteria.
🤖 AI Eligibility Evaluator (DPDP Compliance)
 Analyzes applicant data and evaluates their eligibility based on:
 financial capacity, technical capability, operational readiness, and documentation status.
 Missing documents → NOT a rejection condition.
 Returns strictly formatted JSON with: eligible, riskLevel, decisionReason, missingItems, recommendedNextSteps.
🧼 Parse AI Eligibility JSON Output (Code Node)
 Converts AI output into valid JSON by removing markdown artifacts and ensuring safe parsing.
🔎 Validate Eligibility Status (IF Node)
 Routes the outcome:
 Eligible → approval workflow
 Ineligible → rejection email.
📧 Send Rejection Email to Applicant (Gmail)
 Sends a structured rejection email listing issues and re-submission instructions.
🔗 Merge Registration + Eligibility Summary (Code Node)
 Combines raw registration data with AI eligibility results into one unified JSON package.
📬 Send Approval Email to Compliance Team (Gmail)
 Notifies compliance officers that an applicant passed eligibility and is ready for verification.
🧩 Prepare Status Update Fields (Set Node)
 Constructs the final status value (e.g., “passed”) for updating the database.
📘 Update Registration Status in Sheet (Google Sheets)
 Updates the applicant’s record using contactEmail as the key, marking the final eligibility status.
