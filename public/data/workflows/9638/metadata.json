  "description": "## Who’s it for\n\nTeams that start their day in Slack and want a concise, automated summary of yesterday’s emails—ops leads, PMs, founders, and anyone handling busy inboxes without writing code.\n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nRuns every morning at **08:00** (cron `0 0 8 * * *`), fetches all emails received **yesterday**, and routes the result: if none were found, it posts a polite “no emails” notice; if emails exist, it aggregates them and asks an AI agent to produce a structured digest, then formats and posts to your chosen Slack channel. The flow uses **Gmail → If → Aggregate (Item Lists) → AI Agent (OpenRouter model with structured output) → Code (Slack formatter) → Slack**. A set of sticky notes on the canvas explains each step and required inputs. \n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect **Gmail (OAuth2)** and keep the default date window (yesterday → today at 00:00).\n2. Connect **Slack (OAuth2)** and select your target channel.\n3. Add **OpenRouter** credentials and pick a compact model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).\n4. Keep the provided structured-output schema and formatter code.\n5. Adjust the schedule/timezone if needed (the fallback message includes an Asia/Tokyo example).\n6. Paste this description into the **yellow sticky note** at the top of the canvas.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Gmail & Slack accounts with appropriate scopes\n* OpenRouter API key stored in **Credentials** (no hard-coded keys)\n* n8n Cloud or self-host with LangChain agent nodes enabled\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n* Narrow Gmail results with label/search filters (e.g., `from:`, `subject:`).\n* Change the digest sections or tone in the **AI Agent** system prompt.\n* Swap the model for cost/quality needs and tweak temperature/max tokens.\n* Localize dates/timezones in the formatter code and Slack messages.\n* Branch the output to email, Google Docs, or Sheets for archival.\n\n## Security & publishing tips\n\nRename all nodes clearly, **do not** hardcode API keys, remove real channel IDs/emails before sharing, and group end-user variables in a **Set (Fields)** node. Keep the sticky notes—they’re mandatory for reviewers. \n",
