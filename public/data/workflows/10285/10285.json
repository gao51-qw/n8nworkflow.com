It uses the Visual Crossing API for detailed weather data and integrates with Telegram (or other messaging services) for messaging and alerts.\n\n## Step-by-step\nIn summary, the workflow runs every hour, grabs the current day's weather conditions for [your city/location of interest], and returns only those items that truly contain one or more weather alerts.\n\n📅 Step 1: **Hourly Trigger**\nThe workflow begins with the Hourly Trigger node, which is a scheduleTrigger. This node acts as the clock that initiates the entire process at regular hourly intervals.\n\n🌤️ Step 2: **Fetch Weather Data**\nImmediately after the trigger, the workflow moves to the Meteo node, an httpRequest. This node makes an external API call to fetch weather data for your specified location.\n\nAPI Used: Visual Crossing Web Services\n\nAuthentication: Uses your API key (key=[API KEY])\n\nResponse format: JSON\n\n🌪🌀 Step 3: **Check for Severe Weather**\nThe JSON weather data output is analyzed, and if severe weather conditions or alerts are detected, the workflow sends the alert via your preferred communication channel(s).\n\n## Optional\nYou can replace the Telegram node with email, WhatsApp, SMS notifications, or add multiple notification nodes to receive severe weather alerts across all desired channels.",
