  "description": "This workflow automates the process of transcribing voice notes from Telegram and then summarizing them, finally saving both the transcript and the summary to Google Drive.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what the workflow does:\n* **Triggered by Telegram Message:** The workflow starts when a new message is received on Telegram.\n* **Get Audio File from Telegram:** It then retrieves the audio file from the Telegram message.\n* **Transcribe Audio with OpenAI:** The audio file is sent to OpenAI for transcription.\n* **Save Transcript to Google Drive:** The generated transcript is saved as a new Google Doc in a designated \"N8N Transcribes\" folder within Google Drive. The document is named after the original audio file.\n* **Summarize Transcript with AI:** The transcript is then sent to an AI agent (which uses DeepSeek Chat Model 1 as its language model) to generate a summary description. The prompt instructs the AI to create a plain text summary suitable for a report to a supervisor, expanding on the title and avoiding rich text formatting.\n* **Save Summary to Google Drive:** Finally, the generated summary is saved as a new Google Doc in a \"N8N Summaries\" folder in Google Drive, also named after the original audio file.",
