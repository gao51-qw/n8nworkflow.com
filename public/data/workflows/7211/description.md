**Description**

The Instagram Downloader workflow allows users to download Instagram videos or Reels directly through a Telegram Bot.
Simply send an Instagram link to the bot, and it will process the link via a third-party API to fetch the highest quality video, then send it back to your Telegram chat.

**How It Works**

1. Telegram Trigger
The workflow starts when the bot receives an Instagram link from a user.

2. HTTP Request – URL Download
The link is sent to the API https://www.mediadl.app/api/download to retrieve video metadata.

3. Delay
Waits a few seconds to ensure the API response is ready.

4. Filtering URL Only
Extracts the direct video file URL from the API result.

5. Delay
Adds a short pause to prevent connection errors during download.

6. HTTP Request – Proxy Download
Downloads the MP4 video file directly from the filtered URL.

7. Send Video to Telegram
Sends the downloaded video back to the user in Telegram.
