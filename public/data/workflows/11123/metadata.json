  "description": "## AI Proposal Workflow Overview\n\nThis workflow turns your **sales calls + intake form** into a polished, send-ready proposal.  \nIt pulls the latest call transcript from **Fireflies**, generates structured proposal content with **Azure OpenAI**, builds a proposal in **PandaDoc**, routes it for **Slack approval**, and then handles sending, CRM stage updates (Airtable/HubSpot), and automated follow-ups using the PandaDoc audit trail.\n\nThis workflow is modular. You can replace each major tool:\n- **Fireflies** → Gong, Fathom, Wingman, Avoma (any transcript provider)  \n- **PandaDoc** → DocuSign, Qwilr, Proposify, Google Docs API  \n- **Slack Approval** → Gmail Approval, MS Teams Approval, Notion DB Approvals  \n- **Airtable CRM** → HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho, Monday Sales CRM  \n- **Intake Form** → Typeform, Tally, Jotform, HubSpot forms  \n- **Azure OpenAI** → OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral, or any LLM connected through an API  \n\nThe core logic stays the same — you only swap the nodes.\n\n---\n\n## Who It’s For\n- Agencies & consultants who send similar proposals after every call  \n- B2B SaaS / tech teams that want proposals going out within hours  \n- Solo operators who want AI to handle most of the draft but keep final control  \n- Teams already working out of **Slack**, wanting approval flows there  \n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Form Trigger (Client Proposal Intake)\nClient fills a form with:\n- Name, email, website  \n- Industry / business context  \n- Problem, solution idea, scope  \n- Budget, timeline, deliverables  \n\n### 2. Sales Call Intelligence (Fireflies or Gong)\n- Workflow searches transcripts using the client email  \n- Fetches the relevant transcript + summary  \n\n### 3. AI Proposal Generator (Azure OpenAI or any LLM)\n- Sets initial variables (`draftText`, `lastFeedback`)  \n- Sends transcript + form data into LLM  \n- Returns structured JSON:\n  - introduction  \n  - client_problem  \n  - proposed_solution  \n  - scope_of_work \n  - deliverables \n  - timeline_breakdown \n  - investment  \n  - next_steps  \n\n### 4. Proposal Creation (PandaDoc, DocuSign, etc.)\n- Creates the proposal document from a template  \n- Fills tokens with AI-generated content  \n- Inserts pricing table using Budget  \n\n### 5. Slack Approval Loop\n- Slack message is sent to reviewer with:\n  - **Approve** button  \n  - **Request Changes** button  \n  - Optional comment thread for feedback  \n- If **Approved**:\n  - Proposal is sent automatically via PandaDoc/DocuSign \n  - Slack message to notify proposal has been sent\n- If **Changes Requested**:\n  - Feedback + draft are stored  \n  - Passed back into the LLM to regenerate  \n  - New document is created and the Slack approval request is sent again  \n- This loop continues until approval happens  \n\n### 6. CRM Update (Airtable / HubSpot)\n- After proposal is sent, Stage → **Proposal Sent**  \n\n### 7. Follow-Up System (PandaDoc Audit Trail)\nAfter a 48-hour wait:\n- Audit trail is fetched  \n- If document is **not yet signed**:\n  - Reminder is sent  \n  - Stage → **Reminder Sent**  \n  - Slack message to notify a reminder has been sent\n- If **signed**:\n  - Stage → **Document Signed**  \n---\n\n### Ideal use cases\n- Sales teams creating tailored proposals at scale  \n- Agencies responding quickly to inbound RFPs  \n- Freelancers producing polished proposals in minutes  \n- RevOps teams standardizing proposal formats  \n- SaaS companies automating repetitive proposal creation\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- Transcript provider (Fireflies, Gong, Fathom, etc.)  \n- LLM API (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Claude, etc.)  \n- Proposal tool (PandaDoc, DocuSign, Qwilr)  \n- Slack API app for approval flow  \n- CRM (Airtable, HubSpot, Pipedrive)  \n- Intake form  \n\n---\n\nYou can now integrate this into your lead workflow and let AI + automation handle proposal drafting, Slack approvals, sending, CRM updates, and follow-ups.\n",
