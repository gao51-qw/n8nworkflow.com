## AI Proposal Workflow Overview

This workflow turns your **sales calls + intake form** into a polished, send-ready proposal.  
It pulls the latest call transcript from **Fireflies**, generates structured proposal content with **Azure OpenAI**, builds a proposal in **PandaDoc**, routes it for **Slack approval**, and then handles sending, CRM stage updates (Airtable/HubSpot), and automated follow-ups using the PandaDoc audit trail.

This workflow is modular. You can replace each major tool:
- **Fireflies** → Gong, Fathom, Wingman, Avoma (any transcript provider)  
- **PandaDoc** → DocuSign, Qwilr, Proposify, Google Docs API  
- **Slack Approval** → Gmail Approval, MS Teams Approval, Notion DB Approvals  
- **Airtable CRM** → HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce, Zoho, Monday Sales CRM  
- **Intake Form** → Typeform, Tally, Jotform, HubSpot forms  
- **Azure OpenAI** → OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral, or any LLM connected through an API  

The core logic stays the same — you only swap the nodes.

## Who It’s For
- Agencies & consultants who send similar proposals after every call  
- B2B SaaS / tech teams that want proposals going out within hours  
- Solo operators who want AI to handle most of the draft but keep final control  
- Teams already working out of **Slack**, wanting approval flows there

## How It Works

### 1. Form Trigger (Client Proposal Intake)
Client fills a form with:
- Name, email, website  
- Industry / business context  
- Problem, solution idea, scope  
- Budget, timeline, deliverables  

### 2. Sales Call Intelligence (Fireflies or Gong)
- Workflow searches transcripts using the client email  
- Fetches the relevant transcript + summary  

### 3. AI Proposal Generator (Azure OpenAI or any LLM)
- Sets initial variables (`draftText`, `lastFeedback`)  
- Sends transcript + form data into LLM  
- Returns structured JSON:
  - introduction  
  - client_problem  
  - proposed_solution  
  - scope_of_work 
  - deliverables 
  - timeline_breakdown 
  - investment  
  - next_steps  

### 4. Proposal Creation (PandaDoc, DocuSign, etc.)
- Creates the proposal document from a template  
- Fills tokens with AI-generated content  
- Inserts pricing table using Budget  

### 5. Slack Approval Loop
- Slack message is sent to reviewer with:
  - **Approve** button  
  - **Request Changes** button  
  - Optional comment thread for feedback  
- If **Approved**:
  - Proposal is sent automatically via PandaDoc/DocuSign 
  - Slack message to notify proposal has been sent
- If **Changes Requested**:
  - Feedback + draft are stored  
  - Passed back into the LLM to regenerate  
  - New document is created and the Slack approval request is sent again  
- This loop continues until approval happens  

### 6. CRM Update (Airtable / HubSpot)
- After proposal is sent, Stage → **Proposal Sent**  

### 7. Follow-Up System (PandaDoc Audit Trail)
After a 48-hour wait:
- Audit trail is fetched  
- If document is **not yet signed**:
  - Reminder is sent  
  - Stage → **Reminder Sent**  
  - Slack message to notify a reminder has been sent
- If **signed**:
  - Stage → **Document Signed**
