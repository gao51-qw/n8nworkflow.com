  "title": "Enhance customer support with RAG-powered AI",
  "description": "This workflow automates customer support across multiple channels (Email, Live Chat, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord) using AI-powered responses enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and your product documentation. It intelligently handles incoming queries, provides instant and context-aware answers, and escalates complex or negative-sentiment cases to your human support team. All interactions are logged and categorized for easy tracking and reporting.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Omnichannel Support:** Handles customer queries from Email, Live Chat, WhatsApp, Slack, and Discord.\n- **AI-Powered Answers:** Uses RAG to generate accurate, context-aware responses based on your product documentation.\n- **Automatic Escalation:** Detects low-confidence or negative-sentiment cases and escalates them to your human support team.\n- **Conversation Logging:** Automatically logs and categorizes all conversations for future analysis.\n- **Weekly Reporting:** Sends automated weekly summaries and metrics to your support team.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts when a new message is received on any supported channel.\n2. **Normalization:** Incoming messages are normalized into a common format for unified processing.\n3. **Context Management:** Conversation history is fetched and merged with the new query for better AI context.\n4. **AI Response:** The workflow uses RAG to generate a response, referencing your product documentation.\n5. **Confidence & Sentiment Analysis:** The response is scored for confidence and sentiment.\n6. **Escalation Logic:** If the response is low-confidence or negative, the workflow escalates the case to your support team and creates a ticket.\n7. **Response Delivery:** The answer (or escalation notice) is sent back to the customer on the original channel.\n8. **Logging & Reporting:** All interactions are logged, categorized, and included in weekly reports.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. **Connect Your Channels:** Set up triggers for each channel you want to support (Email, Webhook, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord).\n2. **Add Your Documentation:** Integrate your product documentation source (e.g., Google Docs, Notion, or a knowledge base) for the RAG model.\n3. **Configure AI Model:** Set your preferred AI provider and model (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.).\n4. **Set Escalation Rules:** Adjust confidence thresholds and escalation logic to fit your support workflow.\n5. **Integrate Support Tools:** Connect your ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk) and reporting tools (e.g., Google Sheets, Slack).\n6. **Test the Workflow:** Send test queries from each channel to ensure correct routing, AI responses, and escalation.\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Provide instant, accurate answers to customer questions 24/7.\n- Reduce manual workload for your support team by automating common queries.\n- Ensure complex or sensitive cases are quickly escalated to human agents.\n- Gain insights into support trends with automated logging and weekly reports.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n version 2.0.2 or later\n- Accounts and credentials for your chosen channels and AI provider\n- Access to your product documentation in a supported format\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- Please review and customize the workflow to fit your company’s privacy and data handling policies.\n- For best results, keep your product documentation up to date and well-structured.",
