## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?

Tracking what people say about your brand on Twitter can be overwhelming, especially when important mentions slip through the cracks. This workflow automates the process: it scrapes Twitter mentions, analyzes sentiment using OpenAI, logs everything in a Google Sheet, and sends real-time Slack alerts for **negative tweets**. No manual monitoring needed.

## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

1. Runs on a schedule to monitor Twitter mentions or hashtags.
2. Uses **Apify** to scrape tweets based on brand keywords.
3. Filters out tweets already processed (avoids duplicates).
4. Performs **sentiment analysis** with OpenAI (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
5. Logs tweet content, sentiment, and reply (if any) in a Google Sheet.
6. Sends an instant **Slack notification** for negative tweets.
7. Generates thank-you replies for positive tweets and logs them.

## 🧠 How it Works

### 1. Scheduled Run
Triggered at a fixed interval using the Schedule (Cron) node.

### 2. Scrape Mentions from Twitter
- The Apify actor runs and collects recent tweets mentioning your brand or using your hashtag.
- Links to the tweets are extracted.

### 3. Filter Previously Seen Tweets
- Each tweet is checked against the Google Sheet.
- If already present, it’s skipped to avoid duplicate analysis.

### 4. Analyze Sentiment with OpenAI
- For new tweets, sentiment is classified into:
  - ✅ Positive
  - ⚪ Neutral
  - ❌ Negative

### 5. Store Results in Google Sheet
- The tweet link, content, and sentiment are stored in a row.
- If sentiment is **positive**, a thank-you reply is also generated and saved.

### 6. Notify Slack for Negative Tweets
- When a tweet is tagged **Negative**, a Slack message is sent to the designated channel with the tweet link.
