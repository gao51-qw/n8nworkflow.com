Optimize your WordPress titles and meta descriptions with AI (OpenAI), update them directly in Yoast SEO, log results in Google Sheets, and receive a styled report by email.
All from your own n8n instance.

## ✨ Why this workflow?

Forget spending hours editing metadata manually: this flow automates SEO generation and updates with the help of AI.

* **Fully documented**: every block includes notes so you can easily understand how it works.
* **Error-proof**: reinforced with alternatives and clear alerts if something fails (nested sitemaps, blocks, etc).
* **Flexible and easy to modify**: change language, keywords, or domain in one single node (`OPTIONS`).
* **Basic support included**: designed so anyone can set it up without being an expert.

## 🧠 What does the workflow do?

* Reads the sitemap or internal WordPress URLs (posts or pages).
* The website content is sent to **ChatGPT (GPT-5-nano)**, which analyzes it and generates a **personalized SEO title and meta description for higher precision**.
* Updates the **Yoast SEO fields** in WordPress automatically.
* Logs each result (URL, TITLE, META) into **Google Sheets**.
* Sends a **professional HTML email report** with a summary of the updates.
