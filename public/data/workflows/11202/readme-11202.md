# Manage Trello tasks with AI assistants via MCP server

> A lean MCP Server that exposes the essential Trello tools for everyday task management. Built for clean, reliable LLM automation with n8n, ChatGPT, or Gemini.

# Description  
A minimal MCP Server offering the core Trello operations—create, update, search, list, and comment—designed to keep task management simple and predictable.  
Each tool has a clear, LLM-friendly schema, ensuring safe automation without heavy context or complex payloads.

Use it to create tasks, move cards between lists, update details, add comments, or retrieve board structure. All through natural language.

# ⭐ Key Features

- **Lean Toolset** – only the operations needed for real task flows  
- **LLM-Ready** – minimal, explicit parameters for safe execution  
- **Extendable** – add more Trello endpoints or custom logic easily  
- **Predictable Updates** – partial updates with safe defaults  
- **MCP + Tool Calling** – works in n8n Agents, ChatGPT, Gemini, and MCP clients

# 🧠 Examples (Natural Language)

**“What tasks do I still have pending from last week?”**  
→ Searches by due date and status for weekly planning.

**“Move all tasks due yesterday into today’s list and add a ‘rescheduled’ comment.”**  
→ Combines search + update + comment.

**“Create a new card called ‘Prepare onboarding materials’ for next Monday.”**  
→ Simple card creation with due date handling.

### ✏️ Update Card  
Rename, update description, adjust due dates, or move cards.
