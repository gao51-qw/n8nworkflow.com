A lean MCP Server that exposes the essential Trello tools for everyday task management. Built for clean, reliable LLM automation with n8n, ChatGPT, or Gemini.

# Description  
A minimal MCP Server offering the core Trello operations—create, update, search, list, and comment—designed to keep task management simple and predictable.  
Each tool has a clear, LLM-friendly schema, ensuring safe automation without heavy context or complex payloads.

Use it to create tasks, move cards between lists, update details, add comments, or retrieve board structure. All through natural language.
