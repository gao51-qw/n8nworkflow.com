# Real-time Weather Forecasts with MCP Tools

This n8n workflow demonstrates how to integrate real-time weather intelligence into any automation using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Get current conditions and 5-day forecasts with natural language queries like "What's the weather like in Miami?" or "Will it rain next Tuesday in Seattle?" - all powered by live weather data and AI.

## **Good to know**
* No API keys required - uses hosted MCP weather server with built-in WorldWeatherOnline integration
* Provides current conditions and detailed 5-day forecasts
* Natural language queries work for any location worldwide
* Powered by WorldWeatherOnline - the world's most accurate weather system
* Fully preconfigured and ready to run out-of-the-box
* Enterprise-ready with error handling and rate limiting

## How it works
* **Natural Language Input**: Receives weather queries via webhook, chat, email, or voice
* **AI Agent Processing**: n8n Agent node interprets requests and determines:
 - Location extraction from natural language
 - Weather data type needed (current or 5-day forecast)
 - Response formatting preferences
* **MCP Weather Tool**: Live hosted server provides:
 - Real-time current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, conditions)
 - 5-day detailed forecasts with daily highs/lows
 - Weather descriptions and condition codes
 - Powered by WorldWeatherOnline's premium data
* **Intelligent Responses**: AI formats weather data into:
 - Conversational natural language responses
 - Structured data for downstream automation
 - Action-triggering data for workflows

## How to use
* Import the workflow into n8n from the template
* Add your preferred AI model API key to the Agent node
* Customize the system prompt for your specific use case
* Connect to your preferred input/output channels
* Run and start querying weather with natural language

## Use Cases
* **Smart Home Automation**: "Turn on sprinklers if no rain forecast for 3 days"
* **Travel Planning**: "Check weather for my Paris trip next week"
* **Event Management**: "Will outdoor wedding conditions be good Saturday?"
* **Agriculture/Farming**: "Check 5-day forecast for planting schedule"
* **Logistics**: "Delay shipping if severe weather forecast in delivery zone"
* **Personal Assistant**: "Should I wear a jacket today in Chicago?"
* **Sports/Recreation**: "Surf conditions and wind forecast for weekend"
* **Construction**: "Safe working conditions for outdoor project this week"

## Requirements
* n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
* AI model provider account (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
* Internet connection for MCP weather server access
* Optional: Webhook endpoints for external integrations

## Customizing this workflow
* **Location Intelligence**: Add geocoding for address-to-coordinates conversion
* **Data Storage**: Save weather history to databases for trend analysis
* **Dashboard Integration**: Connect to Grafana, Tableau, or custom visualizations
* **Voice Integration**: Add speech-to-text for voice weather queries
* **Scheduling**: Set up automated daily/weekly weather briefings
* **Conditional Logic**: Trigger different actions based on weather conditions

## Sample Input/Output

Natural Language Queries:
"What's the weather like in Miami?"
"Will it rain next Tuesday in Seattle?"
"5-day forecast for London"
"Temperature in Tokyo tomorrow"
"Weather conditions for outdoor event Saturday"

Rich Responses:
{
 "location": "Miami, FL",
 "current": {
   "temperature": "78°F",
   "condition": "Partly Cloudy",
   "humidity": "65%",
   "wind": "10 mph SE"
 },
 "forecast": {
   "today": "High 82°F, Low 71°F, 20% rain",
   "tomorrow": "High 85°F, Low 73°F, Sunny"
 },
 "ai_summary": "Perfect beach weather in Miami today! Partly cloudy with comfortable temperatures and light winds."
}

## Why This Workflow is Unique
* **Zero Setup Weather Data**: No API key management - MCP server handles everything
* **World-Class Accuracy**: Powered by WorldWeatherOnline's premium weather data
* **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Natural language understanding of complex weather queries
* **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in error handling, rate limiting, and reliability
* **Global Coverage**: Worldwide weather data with location intelligence
* **Action-Oriented**: Designed for automation decisions, not just information display

Transform your automations with intelligent weather awareness powered by the world's most accurate weather system!

## 🧪 Setup Steps
1. ✅ The **Agent node is already configured**:
  * The **system prompt is included**
  * The **tool endpoint is pre-set**
2. All you need to do is:
  * Add your AI model API key to the existing Agent credential
  * Hit run and you're done ✅
