  "description": "# Real-time Weather Forecasts with MCP Tools\n\nThis n8n workflow demonstrates how to integrate real-time weather intelligence into any automation using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Get current conditions and 5-day forecasts with natural language queries like \"What's the weather like in Miami?\" or \"Will it rain next Tuesday in Seattle?\" - all powered by live weather data and AI.\n\n## **Good to know**\n* No API keys required - uses hosted MCP weather server with built-in WorldWeatherOnline integration\n* Provides current conditions and detailed 5-day forecasts\n* Natural language queries work for any location worldwide\n* Powered by WorldWeatherOnline - the world's most accurate weather system\n* Fully preconfigured and ready to run out-of-the-box\n* Enterprise-ready with error handling and rate limiting\n\n## How it works\n* **Natural Language Input**: Receives weather queries via webhook, chat, email, or voice\n* **AI Agent Processing**: n8n Agent node interprets requests and determines:\n - Location extraction from natural language\n - Weather data type needed (current or 5-day forecast)\n - Response formatting preferences\n* **MCP Weather Tool**: Live hosted server provides:\n - Real-time current conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, conditions)\n - 5-day detailed forecasts with daily highs/lows\n - Weather descriptions and condition codes\n - Powered by WorldWeatherOnline's premium data\n* **Intelligent Responses**: AI formats weather data into:\n - Conversational natural language responses\n - Structured data for downstream automation\n - Action-triggering data for workflows\n\n## How to use\n* Import the workflow into n8n from the template\n* Add your preferred AI model API key to the Agent node\n* Customize the system prompt for your specific use case\n* Connect to your preferred input/output channels\n* Run and start querying weather with natural language\n\n## Use Cases\n* **Smart Home Automation**: \"Turn on sprinklers if no rain forecast for 3 days\"\n* **Travel Planning**: \"Check weather for my Paris trip next week\"\n* **Event Management**: \"Will outdoor wedding conditions be good Saturday?\"\n* **Agriculture/Farming**: \"Check 5-day forecast for planting schedule\"\n* **Logistics**: \"Delay shipping if severe weather forecast in delivery zone\"\n* **Personal Assistant**: \"Should I wear a jacket today in Chicago?\"\n* **Sports/Recreation**: \"Surf conditions and wind forecast for weekend\"\n* **Construction**: \"Safe working conditions for outdoor project this week\"\n\n## Requirements\n* n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n* AI model provider account (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)\n* Internet connection for MCP weather server access\n* Optional: Webhook endpoints for external integrations\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n* **Location Intelligence**: Add geocoding for address-to-coordinates conversion\n* **Data Storage**: Save weather history to databases for trend analysis\n* **Dashboard Integration**: Connect to Grafana, Tableau, or custom visualizations\n* **Voice Integration**: Add speech-to-text for voice weather queries\n* **Scheduling**: Set up automated daily/weekly weather briefings\n* **Conditional Logic**: Trigger different actions based on weather conditions\n\n## Sample Input/Output\n\nNatural Language Queries:\n\"What's the weather like in Miami?\"\n\"Will it rain next Tuesday in Seattle?\"\n\"5-day forecast for London\"\n\"Temperature in Tokyo tomorrow\"\n\"Weather conditions for outdoor event Saturday\"\n\nRich Responses:\n{\n \"location\": \"Miami, FL\",\n \"current\": {\n   \"temperature\": \"78°F\",\n   \"condition\": \"Partly Cloudy\",\n   \"humidity\": \"65%\",\n   \"wind\": \"10 mph SE\"\n },\n \"forecast\": {\n   \"today\": \"High 82°F, Low 71°F, 20% rain\",\n   \"tomorrow\": \"High 85°F, Low 73°F, Sunny\"\n },\n \"ai_summary\": \"Perfect beach weather in Miami today! Partly cloudy with comfortable temperatures and light winds.\"\n}\n\n## Why This Workflow is Unique\n* **Zero Setup Weather Data**: No API key management - MCP server handles everything\n* **World-Class Accuracy**: Powered by WorldWeatherOnline's premium weather data\n* **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Natural language understanding of complex weather queries\n* **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in error handling, rate limiting, and reliability\n* **Global Coverage**: Worldwide weather data with location intelligence\n* **Action-Oriented**: Designed for automation decisions, not just information display\n\nTransform your automations with intelligent weather awareness powered by the world's most accurate weather system!\n\n## 🧪 Setup Steps\n1. ✅ The **Agent node is already configured**:\n  * The **system prompt is included**\n  * The **tool endpoint is pre-set**\n2. All you need to do is:\n  * Add your AI model API key to the existing Agent credential\n  * Hit run and you're done ✅\n\n🔗 Full project link: [Github: weathertrax-mcp-agent-demo](https://github.com/jaredco-ai/weathertrax-mcp-agent-demo)",
