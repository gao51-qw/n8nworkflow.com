Check out his templates.\n\n### How it works\nThis workflow will backup your typebots to GitHub. It uses the [Typebot API](https://docs.typebot.io/api-reference/authentication) to export all typebots.\n\nIt then loops over the data, checks in GitHub to see if a file exists that uses the credential's ID. Once checked it will:\n\n- update the file on GitHub if it exists;\n- create a new file if it doesn't exist;\n- ignore if it's the same.\n\nIn addition, it also checks if any flow have been deleted from typebot workspace. If a flow no longer exists in workspace, the corresponding file will be removed from the repository to keep everything in sync.\n\n### Who is this for?\nPeople wanting to backup their typebots(flows) outside the server for safety purposes or to migrate to another server.",
