  "description": "## Nested Loops with Sub-workflows\n\n### Template Description\n\nThis template provides a practical solution for a common n8n challenge: creating nested loops. While a powerful feature, n8n's standard **Loop** nodes don't work as expected in a nested structure. This template demonstrates the reliable workaround using a **main workflow** that calls a separate **sub-workflow** for each iteration.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe template is designed to help you handle scenarios where you need to iterate through one list of data for every item in another list. This is a crucial pattern for combining or processing related data, ensuring your workflows are both clean and modular.\n\n### Instructions for Setup\n\n1. This template contains both the main workflow and the sub-workflow on a single canvas.\n2. **Copy the sub-workflow part** of this template (starting with the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger** node) and paste it into a new, empty canvas.\n3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node in the **main workflow** on this canvas, update the `Sub-workflow` field to link to the new workflow you just created.\n4. Run the main workflow to see the solution in action.\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough of this solution, check out the [full blog post](https://n8nplaybook.com/post/2025/07/how-to-handle-nested-loops-in-n8n-with-sub-workflows/)",
