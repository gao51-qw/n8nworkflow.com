**Sync New Calendly Bookings to Esko CRM with Comment, Sales Activity, and Outlook Email**

## Intro/Overview  
This automation workflow automatically syncs newly scheduled Calendly meetings into Easy Redmine CRM. When a meeting is booked via Calendly, it finds the associated lead in Easy Redmine CRM using the invitee’s email address and logs both a comment and a sales activity in the lead’s record.  
In addition, the workflow sends an email in Microsoft Outlook, ensuring the account manager can check and knows about the meeting.

Ideal for sales teams and customer success managers, this workflow ensures your CRM and calendar stay updated with every new meeting—no manual entry required.

## How it works  

**Calendly Trigger**  
- Watches for `invitee.created` events (newly booked meetings)  
- Authenticates with Calendly via OAuth2  

**Get ID from email**  
- Sends a GET request to Easy Redmine CRM to search for a lead using the invitee’s email  
- Extracts the lead ID, required for further CRM actions  

**Add Comment**  
- Posts a comment to the lead’s record in Easy Redmine CRM  
- The comment includes:  
 - Invitee’s full name  
 - Scheduled date/time of the meeting  
 - Meeting description  

**Sales Activity POST**  
- Creates a new sales activity in Easy Redmine CRM under the same lead  
- Includes structured details:  
 - Invitee’s name  
 - Meeting date and time  
 - Description of the meeting  

**Send an email**  
- Sends a notification email in Microsoft Outlook  
- Maps the name, start time, and description using dynamic values from the Calendly booking  
- Ensures the account manager is informed about the scheduled meeting
