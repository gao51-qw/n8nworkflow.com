## 📝 **Sync MySQL Rows to Google Sheet**

**Description:**

This n8n template automates the process of syncing new records from a MySQL database table into a Google Sheet, ideal for reporting, backup, or lightweight dashboards.

It is designed for teams or individuals who need to periodically export new data rows from a custom database (e.g., CRM, registrations, surveys) into a structured Google Sheet for further analysis, sharing, or archiving—without duplicates.

## 🛠️ **What This Workflow Does:**

* **Runs every 15 minutes** via a schedule trigger.
* **Selects unsynced rows** (`sync = 0`) from a MySQL table (`fifa25_customers`).
* **Checks if records exist** to prevent unnecessary writes.
* **Appends records to a Google Sheet**, mapping fields like name, email, phone, gender, and more.
* **Updates the MySQL table** to mark those rows as synced (`sync = 1`) to avoid reprocessing.
* Fully annotated using sticky notes for easier understanding and onboarding.

## 📋 **Setup Instructions:**

1. **Create or select a Google Sheet** and make sure the columns match the following:

   * `id`, `name`, `phone`, `birthdate`, `email`, `region`, `gender`, `datatime`
2. **Ensure your MySQL table** (`fifa25_customers`) has a `sync` column (default = 0 for new rows).
3. **Connect your MySQL and Google Sheets credentials** inside n8n.
4. **(Optional)**: Add custom filtering or column transformations as needed.
