## How It Works
This workflow automates daily contract monitoring, analysis, and negotiation by retrieving contract data, applying AI-driven legal analysis, identifying potential issues and risks, coordinating multi-agent negotiation workflows, and updating strategic plans. It continuously monitors contracts, performs GPT-4–based contract analysis with detailed risk identification, and flags problematic clauses and unfavorable terms. The system routes identified items to a negotiation agent for structured strategic discussion, applies financial impact analysis to evaluate deal implications, determines negotiation outcomes, logs decisions and results, and updates CAPEX and OPEX planning systems accordingly. Designed for legal departments, procurement teams, corporate counsel, and contract management offices, it supports automated contract risk assessment, informed negotiations, and data-driven strategic planning.
