This tutorial walks you through setting up an automated workflow that **generates AI-powered images** from prompts and securely stores them in **AWS S3**. It leverages the new **AI Tool Node** and OpenAI models for prompt-to-image generation.  

## **Who’s it for**
This workflow is ideal for:
- **Designers & marketers** who need quick, on-demand AI-generated visuals.  
- **Developers & automation builders** exploring **AI-driven workflows** integrated with cloud storage.  
- **Educators or trainers** creating tutorials or exercises on AI image generation.  
- **Businesses** looking to automate **image content pipelines** with AWS S3 storage.  

## **How it works / What it does**
1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts manually when you click **“Execute Workflow”**.  
2. **Edit Fields**: You can provide input fields such as image description, resolution, or naming convention.  
3. **Create AWS S3 Bucket**: Automatically creates a new **S3 bucket** if it doesn’t exist.  
4. **Create a Folder**: Inside the bucket, a folder is created to organize generated images.  
5. **Prompt Generation Agent**: An AI agent generates or refines the image prompt using the **OpenAI Chat Model**.  
6. **Generate an Image**: The refined prompt is used to generate an image using AI.  
7. **Upload File to S3**: The generated image is uploaded to the AWS S3 bucket for secure storage.  

This workflow showcases how to combine **AI + Cloud Storage** seamlessly in an automated pipeline.  

## **How to set up**
1. **Import the workflow** into **n8n**.  
2. Configure the following credentials:  
   - **AWS S3** (Access Key, Secret Key, Region).  
   - **OpenAI API Key** (for Chat + Image models).  
3. Update the **Edit Fields node** with your preferred input fields (e.g., image size, description).  
4. Execute the workflow and test by entering a sample image prompt (e.g., *“Futuristic city skyline in watercolor style”*).  
5. Check your AWS S3 bucket to verify the uploaded image.  

## **Requirements**
- **n8n** (latest version with AI Tool Node support).  
- **AWS account** with S3 permissions to create buckets and upload files.  
- **OpenAI API key** (for prompt refinement and image generation).  
- Basic familiarity with **AWS S3 structure** (buckets, folders, objects).  

## **How to customize the workflow**
- **Custom Buckets**: Replace the auto-create step with an existing S3 bucket.  
- **Image Variations**: Generate multiple image variations per prompt by looping the image generation step.  
- **File Naming**: Adjust file naming conventions (e.g., timestamp, user input).  
- **Metadata**: Add metadata such as tags, categories, or owner info when uploading to S3.  
- **Alternative Storage**: Swap AWS S3 with **Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, or Dropbox**.  
- **Trigger Options**: Replace manual trigger with **Webhook, Form Submission, or Scheduler** for automation.  

✅ This workflow is a **hands-on example** of how to combine **AI prompt engineering, image generation, and cloud storage automation** into a single streamlined process.
