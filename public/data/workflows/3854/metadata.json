Manually extracting, cleaning, and summarizing trends from multiple regions or categories is time-consuming.\n\nThis workflow solves the following problems:\n\n- Automates the conversion of markdown or scraped HTML into clean textual input\n\n- Transforms unstructured data into structured format ready for processing\n\n- Uses AI summarization to generate easy-to-read insights from Google Trends\n\n- Distributes summaries via email and webhook notifications\n\n- Persists responses to disk for archiving, auditing, or future analytics\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n1. Receives input: Sets an URL for the data extraction and analysis.\n\n2. Uses Bright Data’s Web Unlocker to extract content from relevant site.\n\n3. Markdown to Textual Data Extractor: Converts markdown content into plaintext using n8n’s Function or Markdown nodes\n\n4. Structured Data Extract: Parses the plaintext into structured JSON suitable for AI processing\n\n5. Summarize Google Trends: Sends structured data to Google Gemini with a summarization prompt to extract key takeaways\n\n6. Send Summary via Gmail: Composes an email with the AI-generated summary and sends it to a designated recipient\n\n7. Persist to Disk: Writes the AI structured data to disk\n\n8. Webhook Notification: Sends the summarized response to an external system (e.g., Slack, Notion, Zapier) using a webhook\n\n### Setup\n\n- Sign up at [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/).\n- Navigate to Proxies & Scraping and create a new Web Unlocker zone by selecting Web Unlocker API under Scraping Solutions.\n- In n8n, configure the Header Auth account under Credentials (Generic Auth Type: Header Authentication).\n![Header Authentication.png](fileId:1253)\nThe Value field should be set with the \n**Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXX**. The XXXXXXXXXXXXXX should be replaced by the Web Unlocker Token.\n- A Google Gemini API key (or access through Vertex AI or proxy).\n- Update the **Set URL and Bright Data Zone** for setting the brand content URL and the Bright Data Zone name.\n- Update the Webhook HTTP Request node with the Webhook endpoint of your choice.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n1. **Update Source** : Update the workflow input to read from Google Sheet or Airbase etc.\n2. **Gemini Prompt Tuning** : \n- Customize prompts to extract summaries like:\n\t- Summarize the most significant trend shifts\n\t- Generate content ideas from the trending search topics\n3. **Email Personalization** : Configure Gmail node to:\n - Use dynamic subject lines like: Weekly Google Trends Summary – {{date}}\n- Send to multiple stakeholders or mailing lists\n\n4. **File Storage Customization** : \n- Save with timestamps, e.g., trends_summary_2025-04-29.json\n-  Extend to S3 or cloud drive integrations\n5. **Webhook Use Cases** : \n- Send summary to:\n\t- Internal dashboards\n\t- Slack channels\n\t- Automation tools like Make, Zapier etc.\n\n\n",
