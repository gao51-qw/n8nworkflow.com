## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Weekly Monday 9AM Trigger**  
   - A **Cron node** runs every Monday at 9 AM (adjustable).  
   - Ensures summaries arrive at the start of the workweek.  

2. **Prepare Docs List**  
   - A **Code node** defines which Google Docs to monitor.  
   - Includes doc IDs, names, and categories (e.g., Projects, Meetings, Updates).  
   - Sets a 7-day date range for updates.  

3. **Fetch Google Docs & Metadata**  
   - Retrieves document content and metadata (last modified, user, version).  
   - Filters only docs that have been updated in the past week.  

4. **Process Doc Data**  
   - Extracts plain text content from Google Docs.  
   - Cleans and normalizes text for summarization.  
   - Collects key details: word count, modified by, last updated date.  

5. **Aggregate Updated Docs**  
   - Gathers all updated docs into one combined content block.  
   - Prepares context for the AI model to create a weekly digest.  

6. **Generate AI Summary**  
   - Uses **GPT-4** to generate a **business-style weekly summary**.  
   - Includes:  
     - Executive summary  
     - Key updates by document  
     - Important changes  
     - Action items  
     - Next week’s focus  

7. **Prepare Email Content**  
   - Formats the AI response into both plain text and HTML email.  
   - Adds a list of updated documents with last modified info.  

8. **Send Summary Email**  
   - Sends the final summary to the configured team emails via Gmail.  
   - Subject line includes the date range for easy reference.
