  "description": "# Geopolitics Breaking News Alert System\n\n**Workflow Name:** Geopolitics Breaking News Alert System\n**Author:** Devjothi Dutta\n**Category:** Productivity, News & Media, AI/Machine Learning\n**Complexity:** Medium\n**Setup Time:** 45-60 minutes\n\n---\n![Workflow_Snapshot.png](fileId:3141)\n---\n\n## 📖 Description\n\nAn intelligent geopolitical monitoring system that filters 200+ daily news articles down to only the critical breaking news that matters to you. This workflow uses smart keyword filtering and AI-powered scoring to eliminate noise, reduce AI costs, and deliver only high-priority geopolitical alerts to Telegram.\n\n**The Problem:** Traditional news monitoring is overwhelming - hundreds of articles per hour, 95% irrelevant to your region of interest, no urgency prioritization, and critical breaking news gets buried in noise.\n\n**The Solution:** This workflow combines dual-layer filtering (primary + secondary keywords) with AI scoring to distinguish actual breaking news from general news coverage. By filtering first and scoring second, you reduce AI API costs by 80-90% while ensuring you never miss critical geopolitical developments. Switch between monitoring India, China, Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, or any region by simply changing a configuration file.\n\nPerfect for government analysts, corporate security teams, investment research firms, news organizations, or anyone who needs to stay informed about geopolitical developments without information overload.\n\n## 👥 Who's it for\n\n**For Government & Defense Analysts:**\n- Monitor specific regions for military actions, diplomatic developments, and security threats\n- Filter by mission-critical keywords to eliminate irrelevant news\n- AI scoring identifies genuine breaking news vs routine coverage\n- Reduce analyst workload by 90% through intelligent automation\n\n**For Corporate Security & Risk Teams:**\n- Track geopolitical risks affecting global supply chains and operations\n- Custom keyword filters for industry-specific concerns (e.g., \"semiconductor\", \"tariff\", \"sanctions\")\n- Real-time alerts for events impacting business continuity\n- Cost-efficient monitoring with minimal AI API usage\n\n**For Investment Research Firms:**\n- Monitor emerging market geopolitical risks affecting portfolio companies\n- AI scoring differentiates market-moving events from background noise\n- Configurable alert thresholds based on investment strategy (conservative vs aggressive)\n- Track multiple regions simultaneously with different configs\n\n**For News Organizations & Journalists:**\n- Monitor breaking geopolitical developments for editorial coverage\n- Filter by urgency to prioritize assignment desk resources\n- Aggregate multiple international news sources in one place\n- Extend alerts to newsroom Slack channels or email\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n- 🎯 **Smart Dual-Layer Filtering** - Primary keywords ensure regional relevance, secondary keywords filter by event type (military, diplomatic, economic)\n- 🤖 **AI-Powered Urgency Scoring** - GPT-4o-mini scores articles 1-10 based on geopolitical urgency, distinguishing breaking news from routine coverage\n- 💰 **Cost-Efficient Design** - Filter first, score second approach reduces AI API calls by 80-90% (only ~5 articles analyzed out of 200)\n- 🌍 **Multi-Region Support** - Monitor India, China, Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, or any region by switching config files\n- 📰 **Multi-Source RSS Aggregation** - Combines 6 international news sources (NYT, BBC, Al Jazeera, SCMP, regional feeds)\n- 🔄 **Duplicate Detection** - Persistent storage prevents re-analyzing same articles across multiple executions\n- 📊 **Consolidated Alerts** - Single Telegram message with all breaking news, grouped by urgency score\n- ⏰ **Flexible Scheduling** - Configure trigger interval per your needs (15min for active conflicts, 3hr for routine monitoring)\n- 💾 **Config-Driven Architecture** - All filters, keywords, and scoring rules in Google Drive JSON file\n- 🔒 **Production Ready** - Tested end-to-end with real-world India and China configurations\n- 📈 **Scalable Design** - Run multiple regional configs in parallel, extend to Slack/WhatsApp/Email delivery\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements\n\n### Required Services:\n1. **n8n** (version 1.0+) - Workflow automation platform\n   - Free tier: n8n cloud or self-hosted Docker\n   - Required feature: Data Tables (for duplicate tracking)\n2. **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o-mini) - AI scoring engine\n   - Cost: ~$0.10/day for 30min intervals\n   - Free tier: $5 credit for new accounts\n3. **Telegram Bot** - Alert delivery\n   - Free: Create via @BotFather on Telegram\n   - Get chat ID via @userinfobot\n4. **Google Drive** - Config file storage\n   - Free: Any Google account\n   - Used for publicly shared JSON config files\n\n### Required Credentials:\n- **OpenAI API Key** - Get from platform.openai.com (GPT-4o-mini access)\n- **Telegram Bot Token** - Create bot via @BotFather, get token\n- **n8n Data Table** - Built-in n8n feature (no external credential)\n\n### Optional:\n- Slack Webhook URL (for extending alerts to Slack)\n- SMTP credentials (for email alerts)\n- Twilio account (for WhatsApp/SMS alerts)\n\n## 📦 What's Included\n\nThis workflow package includes:\n- Complete n8n workflow JSON (ready to import)\n- [Complete setup guide](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/blob/master/SETUP_GUIDE.md) - Detailed configuration with Data Table setup, troubleshooting\n- [Technical architecture documentation](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md)\n- [Use cases and customization guide](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/blob/master/USE_CASES.md)\n- [4 pre-built regional configs](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/tree/master/configs) (India, China, Middle East, Russia-Ukraine)\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n**Full setup takes 45-60 minutes. For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/blob/master/SETUP_GUIDE.md)**\n\n### Overview\n\n1. **Create n8n Data Table** (`analyzed_articles` with 2 columns)\n2. **Upload config to Google Drive** (choose region, share publicly, get file ID)\n3. **Import workflow** (22 nodes ready to configure)\n4. **Configure nodes:**\n   - Update Google Drive config URL with your file ID\n   - Update 6 RSS Feed URLs for your region\n   - Link 3 Data Table nodes to `analyzed_articles` table\n5. **Add credentials** (OpenAI API, Telegram Bot)\n6. **Set schedule** (15min-daily based on monitoring needs)\n7. **Test workflow** (verify filtering, scoring, alerts work)\n8. **Activate** (workflow runs automatically on schedule)\n\n**Quick Start Result:**\n- ✅ 200+ articles processed → 5-7 filtered → 3-5 scored → 1-3 alerts sent\n- ✅ Telegram receives consolidated breaking news message\n- ✅ Workflow runs every 30min (or your chosen interval)\n- ✅ Total monthly cost: $3-5 (OpenAI API only)\n\n**Need help?** See detailed [SETUP_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert/blob/master/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for complete instructions with screenshots and troubleshooting.\n\n## 📊 Workflow Stats\n\n- **Nodes:** 22\n- **Complexity:** Medium\n- **Execution Time:** ~30-60 seconds per run\n- **Monthly Cost:** $3-5 (OpenAI API usage only)\n- **Maintenance:** Minimal (update RSS feeds if sources change)\n- **Scalability:** Handles 200+ articles per execution, easily scales to 10+ RSS feeds\n\n## 🎨 Customization Options\n\n- **Add more regions:** Create new config JSON files for North Korea, Taiwan, Africa, Latin America, etc.\n- **Multi-channel alerts:** Extend to Slack, WhatsApp, Email, Discord, Microsoft Teams, SMS\n- **Severity-based routing:** Send critical alerts (score 9-10) via SMS, others to Telegram\n- **Custom scoring models:** Switch between GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, Claude based on config\n- **Exclude keywords:** Add \"exclude_keywords\" array to filter out sports, entertainment, weather\n- **Alert digest mode:** Aggregate alerts into daily/weekly summary emails instead of real-time\n- **Dashboard integration:** Connect to Grafana or Metabase for visual trend analysis\n- **Webhook triggers:** Use workflow output to trigger other n8n workflows or external systems\n- **Custom RSS feeds:** Add industry-specific or regional news sources\n- **Adjust alert threshold:** Change from score &gt;= 6 to higher/lower based on notification preferences\n\n## 🔧 How it Works\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger (Configurable):**\n   - Workflow runs at your configured interval (15min, 30min, 1hr, 3hr, daily, etc.)\n   - Trigger frequency depends on use case: active conflicts need more frequent monitoring\n2. **Config Loading:**\n   - HTTP Request node fetches JSON config from Google Drive\n   - Config contains: keywords, scoring rules, AI role, alert threshold, Telegram chat ID\n3. **RSS Aggregation:**\n   - 6 RSS Feed nodes fetch articles from international news sources\n   - Merge node combines all feeds (~200 articles per execution)\n   - RSS Cleanup node strips HTML and normalizes to 5 fields (60-75% size reduction)\n4. **Smart Filtering (Cost Optimization Layer 1):**\n   - Dynamic Filter checks PRIMARY keywords (geographic/entity: \"india\", \"modi\", \"delhi\")\n   - Also checks SECONDARY keywords (event type: \"military\", \"conflict\", \"trade deal\")\n   - **Both conditions required:** Article must mention at least one primary AND one secondary\n   - **Result:** 200 articles reduced to ~5-7 relevant articles (95% reduction)\n   - **Why this matters:** Eliminates noise BEFORE expensive AI scoring\n5. **Duplicate Detection (Cost Optimization Layer 2):**\n   - Queries Data Table for previously analyzed article links\n   - Filters out articles already scored in last 7 days\n   - **Result:** ~5-7 filtered articles reduced to ~3-5 new articles\n   - **Why this matters:** Prevents redundant AI API calls (saves 80% on repeat articles)\n6. **Dynamic AI Prompt Generation:**\n   - Code node builds system prompt from config.ai_role and config.scoring_criteria\n   - Instructs AI: \"You are a geopolitical analyst for [REGION]. Score articles 1-10...\"\n   - Includes scoring rubric: 9-10 = Military Action, 7-8 = Trade/Economic, etc.\n7. **AI Urgency Scoring (Breaking News Detection):**\n   - Breaking News Analyzer (GPT-4o-mini) evaluates geopolitical urgency\n   - Scores 1-10: Distinguishes genuine breaking news from routine coverage\n   - Returns: score, category, reasoning, should_alert (true/false based on threshold)\n   - **Cost:** ~$0.002 per article (only ~3-5 articles scored per execution)\n8. **Alert Decision:**\n   - IF node checks: should_alert === true (score &gt;= config.alert_threshold)\n   - Only high-priority alerts proceed to Telegram\n   - Articles below threshold are logged but not sent\n9. **Alert Aggregation:**\n   - Consolidates multiple breaking news alerts into single Telegram message\n   - Groups by urgency score with color-coded emojis (🔴 9-10, 🟠 7-8, 🟡 6-7)\n   - Includes: score, category, title, link for each alert\n10. **Telegram Delivery:**\n    - Sends consolidated alert to configured Telegram chat\n    - Uses HTML formatting for bold text and clickable links\n    - Chat ID dynamically loaded from config (different regions → different chats)\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n- **Start with Higher Threshold:** Begin with alert_threshold = 7 to avoid alert fatigue, lower to 6 after tuning keywords\n- **Regional RSS Matters:** Use region-specific news sources for better coverage (e.g., Times of India for India, not just BBC/NYT)\n- **Test Keywords First:** Run workflow manually with \"Test Workflow\" to verify keyword filtering before activating schedule\n- **Monitor AI Costs:** Check OpenAI usage dashboard after first week to confirm ~$0.10/day cost estimate\n- **Tune Secondary Keywords:** Add domain-specific terms to secondary keywords (e.g., \"semiconductor\" for tech supply chain monitoring)\n- **Use Separate Configs for Critical Regions:** Clone workflow for high-priority regions instead of switching configs manually\n- **Schedule Based on Time Zones:** Align execution intervals with business hours in monitored region (e.g., 9AM-6PM IST for India)\n- **Clear Duplicates for Testing:** Manually clear analyzed_articles Data Table when testing new configs for fresh results\n- **Backup Working Configs:** Export and version control config files before making major keyword changes\n- **Consider Alert Fatigue:** Score 9-10 events are rare (0-1 per day), score 6-8 events are common (2-5 per day) - set threshold accordingly\n\n## 🔗 Related Workflows\n\n- **Multi-Region Geopolitics Dashboard** - Combine multiple regional configs into single monitoring dashboard\n- **Geopolitical Risk Scoring for Portfolios** - Integrate with stock portfolio data to assess investment risk\n- **Automated Geopolitical Intelligence Reports** - Generate daily/weekly PDF reports from breaking news data\n- **Conflict Escalation Tracker** - Track score trends over time to detect escalating tensions\n- **Supply Chain Risk Alerting** - Focus on trade/sanctions news affecting global supply chains\n\n## 📧 Support & Feedback\n\nFor questions, issues, or feature requests:\n- **GitHub:** [n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert Repository](https://github.com/devdutta/n8n-geopolitics-breaking-news-alert)\n- **n8n Community Forum:** Tag @devdutta\n- **Email:** devjothi@gmail.com\n\n## 📄 License\n\nMIT License - Free to use, modify, and distribute\n\n---\n\n**⭐ If you find this workflow useful, please share your feedback and star the workflow!**\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
