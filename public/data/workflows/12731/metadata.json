  "description": "## How It Works\nThis workflow automates business intelligence reporting by aggregating data from multiple sources, processing it through AI models, and delivering formatted dashboards via email. Designed for business analysts, operations managers, and executive teams, it solves the challenge of manually compiling metrics from disparate systems into coherent reports. The system triggers on schedule or webhook, extracting data from Google Sheets, databases, and APIs. Raw data flows through transformation nodes that calculate KPIs, generate trend analyses, and create visualizations. AI models (OpenAI) provide natural language insights and anomaly detection. Results populate multiple dashboard templates—executive summary, departmental metrics, and detailed analytics—each tailored to specific stakeholder needs. Formatted reports are automatically distributed via Gmail with embedded charts and actionable recommendations. This eliminates hours of manual data gathering, reduces reporting errors, and ensures stakeholders receive timely, consistent insights.\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. Configure Google Sheets credentials and specify source spreadsheet IDs\n2. Set up database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with read-only access\n3. Add OpenAI API key for GPT-4 analytics and narrative generation\n4. Set Gmail OAuth credentials for automated email delivery\n5. Define recipient lists for each dashboard type (executive, departmental, detailed)\n6. Customize dashboard templates with company branding and preferred KPIs\n\n## Prerequisites\nActive Google Workspace account with Sheets and Gmail access. \n## Use Cases\nAutomated weekly executive dashboards with YoY comparisons.\n## Customization\nModify dashboard templates to match corporate branding standards.\n## Benefits\nReduces report preparation time by 80% through full automation.
