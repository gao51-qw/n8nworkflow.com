## Decodo-powered review aggregation to Google Sheets with Gemini analysis and Telegram alerts

### Who’s it for

This template is designed for e-commerce owners, marketplace sellers, product teams, and CX/reputation managers who need an automated way to monitor product reviews. It’s ideal for anyone tracking Amazon listings or other URLs and wants AI-powered sentiment, summaries, and alerts without manual scraping.

### What it does

This workflow automatically retrieves product URLs from Google Sheets, scrapes reviews using Decodo (community node), formats the extracted data, and analyzes it using Gemini AI. It produces both sentiment classification and a concise review summary. Results are saved to a Google Sheets log, and the workflow sends a Telegram alert whenever new reviews are processed. The entire pipeline runs on a schedule, ensuring continuous and fully automated monitoring.

### How it works
- A scheduled trigger starts the workflow.
- Google Sheets provides the list of product URLs.
- Each URL is processed through Decodo to extract user reviews.
- A Code node formats the raw review data.
- Gemini performs sentiment analysis and summarization.
- Results are appended to a Google Sheets review log.
- A Telegram message delivers a real-time summary and sentiment snapshot.
