### 🪐 Use case

Automatically surface and insert the three most relevant “Related articles” at the end of every Shopify blog post to boost session depth, SEO, and reader engagement.

---

### ⚙️ What this workflow does

* Pulls all published articles from a selected **Shopify Blog** using the Admin API.
* Cleans the HTML content (removes existing `.related-articles` blocks) and extracts text for embeddings.
* Generates **OpenAI embeddings** (`text-embedding-3-small`) and stores them in **n8n Data Tables**.
* Calculates **semantic similarity** (cosine distance) between articles to identify the top matches.
* Selects the **Top 3** most relevant related posts for each article (configurable).
* Dynamically builds a `<div>` HTML section and updates the article on Shopify.
* Runs on a weekly schedule to keep relations fresh as new content is added.
