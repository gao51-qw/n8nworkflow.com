## Analyze and Sync Google Maps Reviews to Pinecone

&gt; **Note:** This template requires an Apify account, an OpenAI account, and a Pinecone database.

### Overview
This workflow automates your reputation management by scraping Google Maps reviews, analyzing their sentiment using AI, and storing them in a Vector Database (Pinecone). It also includes a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent that allows you to chat with your review data via Telegram to ask specific questions about customer feedback.

### How it works
* **Scrape:** At a scheduled time (or manually), the workflow triggers an Apify actor to scrape the latest reviews from a specific Google Maps URL.
* **Analyze:** It uses GPT-4o to analyze the sentiment of the reviews and generates a summary of complaints and praises.
* **Notify:** A Telegram message is sent with the sentiment score and a summary of the latest reviews.
* **Store:** The review data is embedded and upserted into a Pinecone Vector Store.
* **Chat (RAG):** You can send messages to a Telegram bot to query the database (e.g., "What are people saying about our coffee?"). The AI retrieves relevant reviews from Pinecone to answer your question.
* **Cleanup:** A weekly schedule cleans up the namespace to ensure data freshness (optional).
