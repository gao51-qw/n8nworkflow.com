# 📊 Google Sheets Leads → 🎲 Random Templates → ✉️ Personalized Emails → 📝 Status Tracking

## What this workflow does

- 📊 Reads leads list from Google Sheets (Name, Email, Send Status)
- 🔍 Filters out already-contacted leads (skips "SENT" status)
- 🎲 Randomly selects email template from template library
- ✏️ Personalizes subject and body with lead's name
- 📧 Sends emails one-by-one with delays between sends
- ✅ Updates Google Sheet with send status and timestamp
- 🔁 Loops through all unsent leads automatically

## Why it's useful

- ⚡ Automate cold outreach without manual copy-paste
- 🎯 Avoid duplicate sends—tracks who's been contacted
- 📝 Rotate email templates for A/B testing and variety
- 👤 Personalization makes emails feel human, not spammy
- ⏱️ Built-in delays prevent spam flags and rate limits
- 📊 Full audit trail of who received what and when

## How it works

- 📊 Google Sheets (Leads) → reads Name, Email, Send Status
- 🚦 IF Node → filters leads where Send Status ≠ "SENT"
- 🔄 Loop Over Items → processes leads one-by-one
- 📧 Google Sheets (Templates) → fetches Subject + Body templates
- 🎲 Code Node → picks random template
- 🔀 Merge → combines lead data with template
- ✏️ Edit Fields → replaces [Name] with actual lead name
- 📨 Send Email → delivers personalized message
- ⏳ Wait → adds delay between sends (avoids spam flags)
- ✅ Google Sheets (Update) → marks as "SENT" with timestamp
