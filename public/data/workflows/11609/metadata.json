  "description": "# Product Price Monitor with Mailchimp and Baserow\n\n**⚠️ COMMUNITY TEMPLATE DISCLAIMER: This is a community-contributed template that uses ScrapeGraphAI (a community node). Please ensure you have the ScrapeGraphAI community node installed in your n8n instance before using this template.**\n\nThis workflow scrapes multiple e-commerce sites for product pricing data, stores the historical prices in Baserow, analyzes weekly trends, and emails a neatly formatted seasonal report to your Mailchimp audience. It is designed for retailers who need to stay on top of seasonal pricing patterns to make informed inventory and pricing decisions.\n\n## Pre-conditions/Requirements\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Running n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n cloud)\n- ScrapeGraphAI community node installed\n- Mailchimp account with at least one audience list\n- Baserow workspace with edit rights\n- Product URLs or SKU list from target e-commerce platforms\n\n### Required Credentials\n| Credential | Used By | Scope |\n|------------|---------|-------|\n| **ScrapeGraphAI API Key** | ScrapeGraphAI node | Web scraping |\n| **Mailchimp API Key & Server Prefix** | Mailchimp node | Sending emails |\n| **Baserow API Token** | Baserow node | Reading & writing records |\n\n### Baserow Table Setup\nCreate a table named `price_tracker` with the following fields:\n\n| Field Name | Type | Example |\n|------------|------|---------|\n| `product_name` | Text | “Winter Jacket” |\n| `product_url` | URL | `https://example.com/winter-jacket` |\n| `current_price` | Number | `59.99` |\n| `scrape_date` | DateTime | `2023-11-15T08:21:00Z` |\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow scrapes multiple e-commerce sites for product pricing data, stores the historical prices in Baserow, analyzes weekly trends, and emails a neatly formatted seasonal report to your Mailchimp audience. It is designed for retailers who need to stay on top of seasonal pricing patterns to make informed inventory and pricing decisions.\n\n## Key Steps:\n- **Schedule Trigger**: Fires every week (or custom CRON) to start the monitoring cycle.\n- **Code (Prepare URLs)**: Loads or constructs the list of product URLs to monitor.\n- **SplitInBatches**: Processes product URLs in manageable batches to avoid rate-limit issues.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI**: Scrapes each product page and extracts the current price and name.\n- **If (Price Found?)**: Continues only if scraping returns a valid price.\n- **Baserow**: Upserts the scraped data into the `price_tracker` table.\n- **Code (Trend Analysis)**: Aggregates weekly data to detect price increases, decreases, or stable trends.\n- **Set (Mail Content)**: Formats the trend summary into an HTML email body.\n- **Mailchimp**: Sends the seasonal price-trend report to the selected audience segment.\n- **Sticky Note**: Documentation node explaining business logic in-workflow.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup Time: 10-15 minutes**\n\n1. **Clone the template**: Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n2. **Install ScrapeGraphAI**: `n8n-nodes-scrapegraphai` via the Community Nodes panel.\n3. **Add credentials**:  \n   a. ScrapeGraphAI API Key  \n   b. Mailchimp API Key & Server Prefix  \n   c. Baserow API Token  \n4. **Configure Baserow node**: Point it to your `price_tracker` table.\n5. **Edit product list**: In the “Prepare URLs” Code node, replace the sample URLs with your own.\n6. **Adjust schedule**: Modify the Schedule Trigger CRON expression if weekly isn’t suitable.\n7. **Test run**: Execute the workflow manually once to verify credentials and data flow.\n8. **Activate**: Turn on the workflow for automatic weekly monitoring.\n\n## Node Descriptions\n\n### Core Workflow Nodes:\n- **Schedule Trigger** – Initiates the workflow on a weekly CRON schedule.\n- **Code (Prepare URLs)** – Generates an array of product URLs/SKUs to scrape.\n- **SplitInBatches** – Splits the array into chunks of 5 URLs to stay within request limits.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI** – Scrapes each URL, using XPath/CSS selectors to pull price & title.\n- **If (Price Found?)** – Filters out failed or empty scrape results.\n- **Baserow** – Inserts or updates the price record in the database.\n- **Code (Trend Analysis)** – Calculates week-over-week price changes and flags anomalies.\n- **Set (Mail Content)** – Creates an HTML table with product, current price, and trend arrow.\n- **Mailchimp** – Sends or schedules the email campaign.\n- **Sticky Note** – Provides inline documentation and edit hints.\n\n### Data Flow:\n1. **Schedule Trigger** → **Code (Prepare URLs)** → **SplitInBatches**  \n2. **SplitInBatches** → **ScrapeGraphAI** → **If (Price Found?)** → **Baserow**  \n3. **Baserow** → **Code (Trend Analysis)** → **Set (Mail Content)** → **Mailchimp**\n\n## Customization Examples\n\n### Change scraping frequency\n```javascript\n// Schedule Trigger CRON for daily at 07:00 UTC\n0 7 * * *\n```\n\n### Add competitor comparison column\n```javascript\n// Code (Trend Analysis)\nitem.competitor_price_diff = item.current_price - item.competitor_price;\nreturn item;\n```\n\n## Data Output Format\n\nThe workflow outputs structured JSON data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"product_name\": \"Winter Jacket\",\n  \"product_url\": \"https://example.com/winter-jacket\",\n  \"current_price\": 59.99,\n  \"scrape_date\": \"2023-11-15T08:21:00Z\",\n  \"weekly_trend\": \"decrease\"\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **Invalid ScrapeGraphAI key** – Verify the API key and ensure your subscription is active.\n2. **Mailchimp “Invalid Audience” error** – Double-check the audience ID and that the API key has correct permissions.\n3. **Baserow “Field mismatch”** – Confirm your table fields match the names/types in the workflow.\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Limit each SplitInBatches run to ≤10 URLs to reduce scraping timeouts.\n- Enable caching in ScrapeGraphAI to avoid repeated requests to the same URL within short intervals.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Use environment variables for all API keys to avoid hard-coding secrets.\n- Add an extra If node to alert you if a product’s price drops below a target threshold.\n- Combine with n8n’s Slack node for real-time alerts in addition to Mailchimp summaries.",
