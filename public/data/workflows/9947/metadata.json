  "description": "![Instagram Lead Magnet Automation.png](fileId:3032)\n\n## **Community Node Disclaimer**\nThis workflow uses **KlickTipp community nodes**, available for **self-hosted n8n instances only**.\n\n---\n\n## **Who’s it for**\nMarketing teams, agencies, and content creators who want to **turn Instagram post comments into automated conversations** — capturing leads, sending personalized DMs, and enriching contacts in **KlickTipp** without manual work.\n\n---\n\n## **How it works**\nThis workflow automates engagement between **Instagram users** and your **marketing funnel**.  \nIt listens for **new Instagram comments**, validates the **Meta webhook**, and sends **personalized DMs** with form links. The workflow then stores and syncs user data for tagging and enrichment in KlickTipp.  \n\nWhen a new comment appears, it:\n\n- Validates the webhook setup via the Meta `hub.challenge`  \n- Captures the commenter’s username and ID  \n- Sends a personalized DM with a form link for lead capture  \n- Stores the data in **Google Sheets** for tracking  \n- Updates or tags the contact in **KlickTipp**  \n\nThe result: every Instagram comment turns into a structured, tagged lead for your marketing automation.\n\n---\n\n## **How to set up**\nConnect accounts for **Meta (Instagram)**, **Google Sheets**, and **KlickTipp**.  \nSet up your **Meta App webhook** for Instagram comments, using your workflow’s webhook URL and verify token (e.g., `KlickTipp`).  \nCreate a Google Sheet as a matching table with the columns:  \n- `Instagram username`  \n- `Instagram ID`  \nAuthenticate KlickTipp with API credentials and ensure your subscriber fields are configured.  \nTest by commenting on a connected Instagram post to trigger the workflow.  \n\n💡 **Pro Tip:** Customize the DM to include your brand’s tone and lead form link for higher engagement.\n\n---\n\n## **Requirements**\n- Meta (Instagram) Business Account  \n- Facebook Graph API with `pages_messaging` permission  \n- Google Sheets OAuth connection  \n- KlickTipp account with API access  \n\n---\n\n## **How to customize**\n- Replace the default form link with your own **JotForm** or landing page URL.  \n- Adjust DM content to fit your tone and campaign messaging.  \n- Add logic to send different DMs based on comment keywords.  \n- Integrate with **KlickTipp tags** for automatic segmentation.  \n- Expand the workflow to handle **repeat commenters** or trigger follow-ups.\n\n",
