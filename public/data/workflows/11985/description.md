|Overview |Sample|
|-|-|
|This template is the first of its kind: it **automatically generates both the caption and the image for your Instagram posts by analysing your existing feed**, with zero spreadsheets or manual steps. Once configured, the workflow runs on a schedule, fetches your past posts, and uses a custom AI agent to craft a new caption and image prompt. Then creates the image via OpenRouter (Nano Banana) and stores everything in Airtable. A Telegram message gives you one‑tap control to **confirm, regenerate or cancel**; if confirmed, the post is published directly to Instagram. **Perfect for creators and marketers** who want fresh, on‑brand content without daily manual effort. | ![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/xcNLCbf.gif)|

## Good to Know

- **Fully hands‑off:** No need to prepare datasets or manually upload assets. The workflow reads your Instagram history via the Graph API and generate new content.
- **AI‑powered creativity:** Uses OpenAI for caption generation and Nano Banana via OpenRouter for image synthesis.
- **Privacy‑friendly:** Your content stays within your Airtable and n8n instance; only the AI models receive anonymised prompts.
- **Nano Banana:** Currently the gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model is used but you can use any available in Open Route.

## How It Works

1. **Scheduling:** A schedule trigger initiates the workflow at your chosen time.
2. **Feed Analysis:** The workflow uses your Instagram business account ID and access token to fetch past posts.
3. **AI Content Generation:** A custom AI agent analyses your captions, applies category tag, and writes a new caption and a detailed image prompt. If there is no content it will be based on the category to create something new.

4. **Image Creation:** The prompt is sent to the Nano Banana model on OpenRouter to generate a new image. The binary is converted to JPEG and stored in Airtable wih the caption and prompt.
5. **Approval via Telegram:** A Telegram bot sends you the generated image, caption and three inline buttons: **Confirm**, **Regenerate** and **Cancel**.
    - ✅ *Confirm*: Uploads the image to Instagram via a Graph API call.
    - ♻️ *Regenerate*: Re‑runs just the AI ​​creation steps, generating a different title and image.
    - ❌ *Cancel*: Updates the Telegram message to note the cancellation and removes the buttons.
6. **Publishing:** When confirmed, the workflow uses the image’s public URL (generated in Airtable and served via an n8n webhook) to create and publish the post on Instagram.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your accounts:**
    - Instagram Business Account connected to a Facebook Page (get your IG Business ID and a long‑lived Graph API access token).

    - Personal access token for Airtable, Telegram bot token and chat ID, OpenAI and OpenRouter API keys.
2. **Create workflows:** Four workflows are included: schedule trigger, webhook to serve the image, main content‑generation workflow and Telegram response workflow.
3. **Replace placeholders:** Fill in your account IDs, token values, n8n instance URL and webhook paths.
4. **Define Category:** Adjust the `Define Category` node to steer the content theme (e.g. *natural landscapes*, *urban fashion*).
5. **Activate and test:**
    - Activate the workflows **"ebhook to serve the image** and **Telegram response workflow**.
    - Configure **Schedule Trigger** workflow to call the **Main Content-Generation Workflow**.
    - Run the **Main Content-Generation Workflow** once to create a sample post and test the Telegram buttons.
    - Activate the schedule for the generation of automatic posts.
