  "description": "**[Click here to access this Workflow for free](https://www.bonzai.pro/auth?action=buyPrice%2Cpri_XVAx_5246)**.\n\n---\n\n# Get your own custom ChatGPT inside your Discord Server\n![DS.png](fileId:1737)\n\n\n## Description\nThis n8n workflow enables a fully autonomous AI assistant within your Discord server. It listens for both public mentions and direct messages (DMs), and replies in real-time using a language model (OpenAI's GPT-4o by default). The assistant can dynamically fetch previous messages for better context, providing smart, coherent, and personalized responses.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 **Key Features**\n\n- **Dual Trigger**: Reacts to both public bot mentions and private DMs.\n- **Context-Aware AI**: Dynamically fetches the last 30 messages from either public or private conversations.\n- **Smart Routing**: Replies either in the original public channel or via DM, depending on where the message came from.\n- **Custom Prompting**: Easily modify the system prompt to define the AI’s tone, behavior, and personality.\n- **Fully Autonomous**: No manual intervention required — the bot always replies instantly.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Requirements\n\n- An operational **n8n instance**.\n- A **Discord bot** with at least these permissions:\n  - Send Messages  \n  - Read Message History  \n  - Manage Messages\n- **OpenAI API key** (or compatible LLM credentials).\n- The community package: `n8n-nodes-discord-trigger`.\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 **Setup Instructions**\n\n#### 1. **Discord Bot Setup**\n- Create and invite your Discord bot to your server with required permissions.\n&gt; You will find in the next step a complete tutorial to craft your own bot with the right code and permissions for this workflow to work\n- Set your Discord bot token in n8n's credential manager.\n\n#### 2. **Install the Community Node** (please read ⚠️ Disclaimer first)\n- Go to `Settings &gt; Community Nodes &gt; Install`\n- Paste: `n8n-nodes-discord-trigger` and install.\n\n#### 3. **Configure the Workflow**\n- Add your Discord bot credentials.\n- Update the LLM credentials with your OpenAI key or alternative.\n- Customize the AI agent system prompt if needed.\n\n---\n\n### 🤖 **How It Works**\n\n- When a **public mention** is detected, the bot replies directly in the channel, referencing the original message.\n- When a **DM** is received, it responds privately.\n- The AI uses tools to **read the latest 30 public or private messages** to build accurate context before replying.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 **Customization Options**\n\n- **Change LLM**: Swap out OpenAI with any LLM that has an API.\n- **Edit Prompt Behavior**: Modify the system prompt to control tone and personality.\n- **Adjust Trigger Filters**: Choose which roles, channels, or patterns activate the flow.\n\n---\n### If you just need a tutorial on setting up your Discord bot, be my guest ➡️ [Here](https://www.bonzai.pro/theo_marcadet/posts/oNz0_19715/discord-bot-setup-tutorial)\n\n---\n\n### And if you need any help, or have any question, feel free to come discuss about it on **[Telegram](https://www.bonzai.pro/theo_marcadet/lp/7018/)** ",
