  "title": "Automate GoDaddy Subdomain Management via Email Requests",
  "description": "This n8n workflow automates subdomain creation and deletion on GoDaddy using their API, triggered via email requests. This empowers developers to manage subdomains directly without involving DevOps for minor tasks.\n\n### Good to know\n\n- Ensure GoDaddy API credentials are securely configured to avoid unauthorized access.  \n- Email parsing accuracy depends on the consistency of request formats.\n\n### How it works\n\n- Detect new email requests using the `Start Workflow (GET Request)` node.  \n- Use the `Extract Data from Email` node to parse relevant details (e.g., subdomain name, action type).  \n- Validate the action type with the `Validate Action Type` node to proceed with create (`true`) or delete (`false`).  \n- If `true`, the `Create Subdomain` node sends a POST request to GoDaddy’s API to create the subdomain.  \n- If `false`, the `Delete Subdomain` node sends a DELETE request to remove the subdomain.  \n- The `Send Email Response` node notifies the requester of the action’s success or failure.\n\n### How to use\n\n- Import the workflow into n8n and configure the nodes with your GoDaddy API and email credentials.  \n- Test with sample email requests to ensure proper parsing and API calls.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- GoDaddy API credentials  \n- Email service (e.g., SMTP or API) for notifications  \n\n### Customising this workflow\n\n- Adjust the `Extract Data from Email` node to match your email format or add additional validation steps for security.\n",
