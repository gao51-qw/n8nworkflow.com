This n8n workflow automates subdomain creation and deletion on GoDaddy using their API, triggered via email requests. This empowers developers to manage subdomains directly without involving DevOps for minor tasks.

### Good to know

- Ensure GoDaddy API credentials are securely configured to avoid unauthorized access.  
- Email parsing accuracy depends on the consistency of request formats.

### How it works

- Detect new email requests using the `Start Workflow (GET Request)` node.  
- Use the `Extract Data from Email` node to parse relevant details (e.g., subdomain name, action type).  
- Validate the action type with the `Validate Action Type` node to proceed with create (`true`) or delete (`false`).  
- If `true`, the `Create Subdomain` node sends a POST request to GoDaddy’s API to create the subdomain.  
- If `false`, the `Delete Subdomain` node sends a DELETE request to remove the subdomain.  
- The `Send Email Response` node notifies the requester of the action’s success or failure.

### How to use

- Import the workflow into n8n and configure the nodes with your GoDaddy API and email credentials.  
- Test with sample email requests to ensure proper parsing and API calls.

### Requirements

- GoDaddy API credentials  
- Email service (e.g., SMTP or API) for notifications  

### Customising this workflow

- Adjust the `Extract Data from Email` node to match your email format or add additional validation steps for security.
