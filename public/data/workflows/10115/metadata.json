  "description": "This workflow automates the process of **monitoring Amazon product prices** and **sending alerts** when a product’s price drops below a defined threshold.\n\nIt integrates **ScrapeGraphAI**, **Google Sheets**, and **Telegram** to provide a complete end-to-end price tracking system.\n\n---\n\n###  **Key Advantages**\n\n1. **💡 Intelligent Scraping**\n\n   * Uses **ScrapeGraphAI** to extract structured data (product prices) from complex Amazon pages — even those with dynamic JavaScript rendering.\n\n2. **📊 Centralized Tracking**\n\n   * All products and price history are managed in a **Google Sheet**, making it easy to review and update data.\n\n3. **⚡ Real-Time Alerts**\n\n   * Sends **instant Telegram notifications** when a product’s price drops below its previous minimum — helping users take quick advantage of deals.\n\n4. **🔁 Fully Automated**\n\n   * Once set up, it runs on a **schedule** with no manual input required, automatically updating and alerting users.\n\n5. **🧩 Modular & Extensible**\n\n   * Built entirely with **n8n nodes**, making it easy to customize — for example, adding new alert channels (email, Slack) or additional data checks.\n\n6. **🕒 Time-Efficient**\n\n   * Eliminates the need for manual price checking, saving significant time for users monitoring multiple products.\n\n---\n\n\n### How it Works\n\nThis automated workflow tracks Amazon product prices and sends an alert via Telegram when a product hits a new lowest price. Here's the process:\n\n1.  **Trigger & Data Fetch:** The workflow is initiated either on a scheduled basis (every 10 minutes) or manually. It first connects to a designated Google Sheet, which acts as a database, to fetch a list of products to monitor. Each product's details (Name, URL, and current \"MIN PRICE\") are read.\n\n2.  **Price Scraping & Comparison:** The workflow loops through each product from the sheet. For each product, it uses ScrapeGraphAI to navigate to the Amazon product page, render JavaScript-heavy content, and extract the current price. This newly scraped price is then compared to the \"MIN PRICE\" value stored in the Google Sheet for that product.\n\n3.  **Conditional Alert & Update:**\n    *   **If the new price is lower,** two actions are triggered:\n        a. **Sheet Update:** The Google Sheet is updated with the new, lower \"MIN PRICE\" and the current date.\n        b. **Telegram Notification:** A message is sent to a specified Telegram chat, announcing that the product has hit a new lowest price, including the product name and a link.\n    *   **If the price is not lower,** no action is taken for that product, and the workflow moves on to the next one in the loop.\n\n---\n\n### Set up Steps\n\nTo implement this workflow yourself, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**\n    *   Create a copy of the [provided template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FBegOUXt3657og_ScfuiLCERWHtxDWn14799HkVrUo/edit?usp=sharing).\n    *   In the sheet, fill in the columns for `PRODUCT` (name), `URL` (the full Amazon product link), and `MIN PRICE`. When adding a new product, set the `MIN PRICE` to a very high value (e.g., 9999) to ensure the first real price triggers an alert.\n\n2.  **Configure n8n Credentials:**\n    *   **Google Sheets:** Set up a \"Google Sheets account\" credential in n8n using OAuth2 to grant the workflow access to your copied spreadsheet.\n    *   **ScrapeGraphAI:** Configure the \"[ScrapegraphAI account](https://dashboard.scrapegraphai.com/?via=n3witalia)\" credential with your API key from the ScrapeGraphAI service.\n    *   **Telegram:** Set up a \"Telegram account\" credential with a Bot Token obtained from the BotFather in Telegram. You will also need your specific `chatId` for the node.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
