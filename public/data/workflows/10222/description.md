## 🔧 Setup Steps

#### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Google Sheet

Create a sheet called **“Employee_Recognition_List”** with these columns:
`Name | Department | Reason | Date | Email | Status | EmailStatus`
Then add one test row — for example, your own name — to see it work.

#### 2️⃣ Connect Your Apps

Inside n8n:

* **Google Sheets:** Connect your Google account so the bot can read the sheet.
* **Slack:** Connect your Slack workspace to post messages in a channel (like `#general`).
* **Gmail:** Connect your Gmail account so the bot can send emails automatically.

---

#### 3️⃣ (Optional) Add AI Personalization

If you want the messages to sound more natural, add an OpenAI node with this prompt:

&gt; “Write a short, friendly recognition message for {{name}} from {{dept}} who was recognized for {{reason}}. Keep it under 2 sentences.”

This makes your Slack and email messages feel human and genuine.

#### 4️⃣ Turn It On

Once everything’s connected:

* Save your workflow
* Set it to **Active**
* Add a new row in your Google Sheet

The bot will instantly post on Slack and send a thank-you email 🎉
