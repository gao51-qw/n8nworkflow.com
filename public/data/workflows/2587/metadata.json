  "description": "This workflow facilitates seamless synchronization between Entra (Microsoft Azure AD) and Zammad. It automates the following processes:\n\n1. **Fetch Entra Group Members**: Retrieves users from a designated Entra group. These users are candidates for synchronization.\n2. **Create Universal User Object**: Extracts key user information, such as email, phone, and name, and formats it for Zammad compatibility.\n3. **Synchronize with Zammad**:\n   - Identifies users in Zammad who need updates based on Entra data.\n   - Adds new users from Entra to Zammad.\n   - Deactivates users in Zammad if they are no longer in the Entra group.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Dynamic Matching**: Compares users from Entra with existing Zammad users based on email and updates records accordingly.\n- **Efficient Management**: Automatically creates, updates, or deactivates Zammad users based on their status in Entra.\n- **Custom Fields**: Supports custom field mapping, ensuring enriched user profiles in Zammad.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Microsoft Entra Integration**:\n   - Ensure proper API permissions for accessing Entra groups and members.\n   - Configure Microsoft OAuth2 credentials in n8n.\n\n2. **Zammad Integration**:\n   - Set up Zammad API credentials with appropriate access rights.\n   - Customize the workflow to include additional fields or map existing fields as needed.\n\n3. **Run Workflow**:\n   - Trigger the workflow manually or set up an automation schedule (e.g., daily sync).\n   - Review created/updated/deactivated users in Zammad.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **IT Administration**: Keep your support system in sync with the organization’s Entra data.\n- **User Onboarding**: Automatically onboard new hires into Zammad based on Entra groups.\n- **Access Management**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date user records in Zammad.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Access to an Entra (Azure AD) environment with group data.\n- A Zammad instance with API credentials for user management.\n- A custom field in Zammad User Object (`entra_key`) of type `String`.\n\n![Bildschirmfoto 20241201 um 13.56.37.png](fileId:870)\n\n- A custom field in Zammad User Object (`entra_object_type`) of type `Single selection field with two key value pairs\n  -  user = User\n  -  contact = Contact`\n\n![Bildschirmfoto 20241201 um 13.57.17.png](fileId:869)\n\n\n---\n\nThis workflow is fully customizable and can be adapted to your organization’s specific needs.
