# Daily Stock Regulatory News Aggregator with Compliance Alerts and Google Sheets Tracking

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Compliance officers and regulatory teams
- Financial services firms monitoring regulatory updates
- Investment advisors tracking regulatory changes
- Risk management professionals
- Corporate legal departments
- Stock traders and analysts monitoring regulatory news

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manually monitoring regulatory updates from multiple agencies (SEC, FINRA, ESMA) is time-consuming and error-prone. This template automates daily regulatory news monitoring, aggregates updates from major regulatory bodies, filters for recent announcements, and instantly alerts compliance teams to critical regulatory changes, enabling timely responses and maintaining regulatory compliance.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically monitors regulatory news daily, scrapes the latest updates from major regulatory agencies using AI-powered web scraping, filters for updates from the last 24 hours, and sends Slack alerts while logging all updates to Google Sheets for historical tracking.

### Key Components

1. **Daily Schedule Trigger** - Automatically runs the workflow every 24 hours to check for regulatory updates
2. **Regulatory Sources Configuration** - Defines the list of regulatory agencies and their URLs to monitor (SEC, FINRA, ESMA)
3. **Batch Processing** - Iterates through regulatory sources one at a time for reliable processing
4. **AI-Powered Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to intelligently extract regulatory updates including title, summary, date, agency, and source URL
5. **Data Flattening** - Transforms scraped data structure into individual update records
6. **Time Filtering** - Filters updates to keep only those from the last 24 hours
7. **Historical Tracking** - Logs all filtered updates to Google Sheets for compliance records
8. **Compliance Alerts** - Sends Slack notifications to compliance teams when new regulatory updates are detected

## 💰 Key Features

### Automated Regulatory Monitoring

- Empty results: Verify regulatory sites are accessible and haven't changed structure

**Optimization Tips:**
- Start with one regulatory source to test the workflow
- Monitor API usage and costs regularly
- Use batch processing to avoid overwhelming scraping services
- Implement retry logic for failed scraping attempts
- Consider caching mechanisms for frequently checked sources
- Adjust the number of updates extracted based on typical volume
