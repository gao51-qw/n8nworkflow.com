  "title": "Manage User Authentication with Telegram, Redis Cache and Google Sheets",
  "description": "How It Works\n\n- Telegram bot listens for messages and uses chat ID as the unique user identifier.\n- Checks Google Sheets for existing users; registers new users if not found.\n- Caches active sessions in Redis for fast lookup and login-state handling.\n- Stores and retrieves user data (UserID, Name, Telegram Chat ID) in Google Sheets.\n- Can be triggered by other n8n workflows to fetch or update user/session data.\n\nSetup Steps\n\n- Obtain Telegram Bot token, Google Sheets “Users” sheet with API credentials, and a Redis instance.\n- Import the n8n workflow and configure Redis, Telegram Bot, and Google Sheets credentials.\n- Expect 30–45 minutes to complete workflow import, Redis setup, and API wiring.\n- Refer to sticky notes inside the workflow for exact field mappings and node configurations.",
