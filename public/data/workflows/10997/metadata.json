  "description": "## 📌 Overview\n\nThis workflow provides an **automated pipeline for processing medical X-ray images** using **VLM Run (model: `vlmrun-orion-1:auto`)**, and distributing the AI-generated analysis to multiple channels—**email, Telegram, and Google Drive**.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n### **1. Upload X-Ray Image**\n\nA **Form Trigger** allows the user to upload an X-ray file.\nOnce the image is submitted, the workflow immediately starts processing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Automated X-Ray Analysis**\n\nThe uploaded X-ray image is sent to **VLM Run (`vlmrun-orion-1:auto`)** via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.\n\nThe model returns:\n\n* A text-based interpretation or description\n* A disease-highlighted output image (if detected)\n* A URL reference pointing to the annotated result image stored in Google Cloud\n\n---\n\n### **3. Extract Artifact**\n\nFrom artifact reference, download file using artifact node.\n\n\n---\n\n### **4. Generate Report File**\n\nThe **Convert to File** node transforms the analysis text into a shareable `.txt` report.\nThis file is used both for email and Drive storage.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Send Notifications to Gmail & Telegram**\n\nThe workflow automatically:\n\n📧 **Emails the doctor** (or configured staff email):\n\n* The diagnostic description\n* The generated report file\n* The annotated X-ray image\n\n📨 **Sends a Telegram message** containing:\n\n* The same report\n* The disease-highlighted X-ray image\n\nThis ensures instant notification and cross-platform availability.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Upload to Google Drive**\n\nThe final step uses **Google Drive OAuth2** to store:\n\n* The report file\n* The annotated medical image\n\nThese files are uploaded to a designated Drive folder for archiving and future reference.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Key Features\n\n* ✔️ Automated X-ray processing using VLM Run\n* ✔️ Structured extraction of annotated medical images\n* ✔️ Multi-channel notification (Email + Telegram)\n* ✔️ Centralized archive via Google Drive\n* ✔️ Zero manual intervention after upload\n* ✔️ Works with OpenAI-compatible VLM endpoints\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Requirements\n\n* **VLM Run API Credentials**\n  Required to call `vlm-agent-1` for image analysis.\n\n* **Gmail OAuth2 Credentials**\n  Needed to automatically email the diagnostic report.\n\n* **Telegram Bot Token**\n  Sends analysis results to a Telegram chat or group.\n\n* **Google Drive OAuth2**\n  Stores reports and annotated images in Google Drive.\n\n\n---\n\n## 📎 Notes\n\nThis workflow automates image handling and communication.\nAll AI-generated content must be reviewed by a qualified medical professional before any clinical use.\n\n\n",
