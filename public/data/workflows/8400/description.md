## What this workflow does

This template automates the entire process of documenting **Sprint Reviews in Scrum**:  
1. **Input Collection** – Through a friendly form, users upload the **transcript file** (meeting notes, sprint review transcript, or VTT captions) and specify the sprint name and domain.  
2. **Transcript Parsing** – A Code node formats the transcript into clean [HH:MM:SS] Speaker: text lines, supporting VTT, Zoom, or custom timestamp formats used in Scrum events.  
3. **AI-Driven Summary** – The AI Agent (LangChain + OpenAI) produces a well-structured **AI summarization** in Markdown, including:  
   - A 3–5 bullet Executive Summary of sprint review highlights  
   - A Presentation Recap table (Timestamp | Presenter | Topics)  
   - A list of Action Items with owners (if recognizable from the transcript)  
4. **Preview** – The summary renders as a styled card with custom CSS for easy readability in n8n.  
5. **Archive** – Automatically appends a record to Google Sheets, saving the date, domain, sprint, transcript file name, and the **AI-generated sprint review summary**.  

## Why it’s useful
- **Zero manual summarizing** – AI extracts key insights from transcript files into Markdown you can instantly share with your Scrum team and stakeholders.  
- **Easy setup** – drag-and-drop import, plus form-based input for non-technical users during sprint reviews.  
- **Centralized tracking** – all past sprint summaries live in one spreadsheet for retrospectives, audits, and continuous improvement.  
- **Flexible and extendable** – you can switch to Airtable, Slack, or Notion, or refine the summary template to match your Scrum workflow.  

## Ideal for
- **Scrum Masters** wanting quick sprint review summaries for stakeholders  
- **Agile Coaches** analyzing sprint review transcripts, presentation patterns, and follow-up tasks  
- **Product Owners** keeping a searchable log of sprint outcomes and action items
