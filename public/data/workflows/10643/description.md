## How to Use

### Understanding Workflow Execution

**Default Schedule: Hourly**
- Executes every hour
- Checks all channels
- Processes videos from last 60 minutes
- Prevents duplicate notifications

**Execution Duration:** 1-5 minutes for 10 channels. Rate limiting adds 30 seconds per video.

### Adding New Channels

1. Open Channel List node
2. Add new URL on new line
3. Save (Ctrl+S)
4. Change takes effect on next run

### Removing Channels

1. Open Channel List node
2. Delete line or comment out with # at start
3. Save changes

### Changing Check Frequency

1. Open Hourly Check node
2. Modify interval
3. If changing from hourly, update Filter New Videos node:
   - Find: `cutoffDate.setHours(cutoffDate.getHours() - 1);`
   - Change -1 to match interval (-2 for 2 hours, -6 for 6 hours)

**Important:** Time window should match or exceed check interval.

### Understanding Video Sources

**RSS Feed (Primary):**
- Official YouTube RSS
- Fast and reliable
- 5-15 minute delay for new videos
- Structured data

**HTML Scraping (Fallback):**
- Immediate results
- Works when RSS unavailable
- More fragile

**Benefits of dual approach:**
- Reliability: If one fails, other works
- Speed: Scraping catches videos immediately
- Completeness: RSS ensures nothing missed
- Videos are deduplicated automatically

### Excluding YouTube Shorts

Shorts are filtered by checking URL for /shorts/ path.

**To include Shorts:**
1. Open Filter New Videos node
2. Find: `if (videoUrl && !videoUrl.includes('/shorts/'))`
3. Remove the !videoUrl.includes('/shorts/') check

### Rate Limiting

**30-second wait between notifications:**
- Prevents flooding RocketChat
- Allows users to read each notification
- Avoids rate limits

**Impact:** 5 videos = 2.5 minutes, 10 videos = 5 minutes

**To adjust:** Open Wait 30 sec node, change amount field (15-60 seconds recommended)

### Handling Multiple Channels

Channels processed sequentially:
- Prevents overwhelming workflow
- Ensures reliable execution
- One failed channel doesn't stop others
- Recommend 20-50 channels per workflow

## FAQ

**Q: How many channels can I monitor?**
A: Recommend 20-50 per workflow. Split into multiple workflows for more.

**Q: Why use both RSS and scraping?**
A: RSS is reliable but delayed. Scraping is immediate but fragile. Both ensures no videos missed.

**Q: Can I exclude specific video types?**
A: Yes, add filtering logic in Filter New Videos node. Already excludes Shorts.

**Q: Will this get my IP blocked?**
A: Unlikely with hourly checks. Don't check more than every 15 minutes.

**Q: How do I prevent duplicate notifications?**
A: Ensure time window matches schedule interval. Already implemented.

**Q: What if channel changes handle?**
A: Update URL in Channel List node. YouTube maintains redirects.

**Q: Can I monitor playlists?**
A: Not directly. Would need modifications for playlist RSS feeds.
