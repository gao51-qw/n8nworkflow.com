## How it works
This template streamlines email scraping from Google Maps using only n8n core nodes, ensuring a completely free and self-contained solution. Here’s how it operates:

### Input Queries
You provide a list of queries, each consisting of keywords related to the type of business you want to target and the specific region or subregion you’re interested in.

### Iterates through Queries
The workflow processes each query one at a time. For each query, it triggers a sub-workflow dedicated to handling the scraping tasks.

### Scrapes Google Maps for URLs
Using these queries, the workflow scrapes Google Maps to collect URLs of business listings matching the provided criteria.

### Fetches HTML Content
The workflow then fetches the HTML pages of the collected URLs for further processing.

### Extracts Emails

Using a Code Node with custom JavaScript, the workflow runs regular expressions on the HTML content to extract business email addresses.

## Setup
1. **Add Queries:**
Open the first node, "Run Workflow" and input a list of queries, each containing the business keywords and the target region.

2. **Configure the Google Sheets Node:**
Open the Google Sheets node and select a document and specific sheet where the scraped results will be saved.

3. **Run the workflow**:
Click on "Test workflow" and watch your Google Sheets document gradually receive business email addresses. 

## Customize as Needed:

You can adjust the regular expressions in the Code Node to refine the email extraction logic or add logic to extract other kinds of information.
