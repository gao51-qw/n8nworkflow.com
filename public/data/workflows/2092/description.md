## How It Works
- This workflow sends an HTTP request to OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, returning an .mp3 audio recording of the provided text.
- This template is meant to be adapted for your individual use case, and requires a valid OpenAI credential.

## Gotchas
- Per OpenAI's [Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies), you must provide a clear disclosure to end users that the TTS voice they are hearing is AI-generated and not a human voice, if you are using this workflow to provide audio output to users.
