**How it works**

This workflow provides a complete, automated backup solution for your n8n instance, running on a daily schedule to ensure your automations are always safe.

* **Automatic cleanup:** It first connects to your Google Drive to find and delete old backup folders, keeping your storage clean and organized based on a retention number you set.
* **Daily folder creation:** It then creates a new, neatly dated folder to store the current day's backup.
* **Fetches & saves workflows:** Finally, it uses the n8n API to get a list of all your workflows, converts each one to a `.json` file, and uploads them to the newly created folder in Google Drive.

**Set up steps**

**Setup time: ~3 minutes**

This template is designed to be as plug-and-play as possible. All configurations are grouped in a single node for quick setup.

* **Connect your accounts:** Authenticate the `Google Drive` and `n8n API` nodes with your credentials.
* **Configure main settings:** Open the `Set` node named **"CONFIG - Set your variables here"** and:
    * Paste the ID of your main Google Drive folder where backups will be stored.
    * Adjust the number of recent backups you want to keep.
* **Activate workflow:** Turn on the workflow. Your automated backup system is now active.
