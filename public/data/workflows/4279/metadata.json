  "description": "# 🤖 Automated Email Sorting & FAQ Reply Assistant (n8n + Gemini AI)\n\n## 🔍 Overview\n\nThis **n8n workflow** automates email triage and FAQ responses using **Google Sheets** and **Gemini AI**. It’s designed to:\n\n- Automatically **sort incoming emails** into categories (e.g., FAQ, Billing, Tech Support).\n- **Draft polite, relevant replies** for FAQ emails using **AI**, grounded in your pre-approved content.\n- Maintain a **human-in-the-loop** process by saving responses as Gmail drafts for manual review.\n\nPerfect for startups or teams seeking to reduce support workload while ensuring consistent, helpful responses.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Pre-conditions / Requirements\n\nBefore using this workflow, make sure you have:\n\n- ✅ A **Google account** with access to:\n  - Gmail (with custom labels like `FAQ-Waiting`, `FAQ-Draft`)\n  - Google Sheets (used as your FAQ source)\n- ✅ A **Gemini API key** (to generate AI replies)\n- ✅ A **dedicated Gmail label** to collect emails needing draft replies (e.g., `FAQ-Waiting`)\n- ✅ A **dedicated Gmail label** to store drafted replies for manual sending (e.g., `FAQ-Draft`)\n- ✅ A **Google Sheet with two columns**:\n  - `Question` — common user inquiries\n  - `Answer` — the matching, approved reply text\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger**  \n   - Scheduled workflow run (e.g., every 15 minutes)\n\n2. **Fetch Emails**  \n   - Grabs Gmail messages under a specific label like `FAQ-Waiting`\n\n3. **Process & Clean**  \n   - Loops through each email  \n   - Cleans content (removes signatures/HTML)  \n   - Sends it to Gemini AI\n\n4. **AI Reply Drafting**  \n   - AI matches email intent against your FAQ from Google Sheets  \n   - Generates a **friendly, accurate draft reply**, grounded **only** in your predefined Q&A\n\n5. **Update Gmail**  \n   - Removes `FAQ-Waiting` label  \n   - Adds `FAQ-Draft` label  \n   - Saves draft reply in Gmail for manual review and sending\n\n6. **Fallback Routing**  \n   - If email doesn’t match FAQ criteria, it follows a `FALSE` path  \n   - You can implement further logic here (e.g., route to Billing, escalate to a human agent, log as feedback)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Connect Gmail + Google Sheets + Gemini AI**\n   - Set up credentials in n8n for Gmail, Google Sheets, and Gemini AI\n\n2. **Prepare Labels in Gmail**\n   - Create: `FAQ-Waiting` (input folder), `FAQ-Draft` (drafts ready to send)  \n   - Optionally, create other labels (e.g., `Billing`, `Tech Support`)\n\n3. **Build your FAQ Sheet**\n   - Create a new Google Sheet with:\n     - Column A: `Question`\n     - Column B: `Answer`\n   - Add rows with typical user questions and the matching replies\n\n4. **Configure AI Agent**\n   - In the **AI agent node**, edit the prompt to fit your tone of voice (friendly, professional, concise, etc.)\n   - Ensure the AI is instructed to only use answers from the sheet, and not hallucinate\n\n5. **Adjust Schedule**\n   - Modify the trigger interval to match your needs (e.g., every X minutes)\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Customization Tips\n\n- **Custom Prompts**: Tailor the Gemini AI prompt in the node to change tone, length, or structure of replies\n- **Add New Categories**: Use the `FALSE` path in the `IF` node to handle non-FAQ emails (e.g., route to Billing, escalate to human agent, log feedback)\n- **Multiple Sheets**: You can expand the system by using different sheets for different topics\n- **Tone Matching**: Adjust AI output by providing sample reply templates or tone instructions directly in the AI node\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Use Cases\n\n- SaaS startups triaging customer support  \n- Solo founders who want consistent replies with minimal effort  \n- Teams managing growing inbox volumes while maintaining quality support\n\n---\n\n",
