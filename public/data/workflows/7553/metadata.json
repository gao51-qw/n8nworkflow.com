  "description": "## Gmail AI Email Classifier & Notifier\n\nSince Gmail inboxes can quickly become cluttered, this workflow provides an **automated AI-based email classification system**. It listens for new emails, categorizes them using an AI classifier, applies Gmail labels, and sends you a **Telegram notification** with a quick summary.\n\nIf you often miss **urgent client messages** or struggle with sorting **work vs. promotions**, this workflow ensures you never overlook important emails.\n\n**Use case:** Especially useful for professionals who receive a high volume of mixed emails (clients, work, promotions). The workflow automatically labels and notifies you of new emails based on their category.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger Input**\n\n   * The workflow starts with the **Gmail Trigger** node, which listens for new incoming emails.\n   * By default, it polls every **minute**, but you can adjust the polling frequency.\n   * Email metadata (`from`, `subject`, `body`) is passed downstream.\n\n   Example JSON input:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"from\": \"client@example.com\",\n     \"subject\": \"Urgent project deadline\",\n     \"text\": \"Please review the attached contract ASAP\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Classify Email (AI)**\n\n   * The **Classification Agent** (powered by OpenAI via LangChain) receives the email data.\n   * It sorts the email into one of four categories:\n\n     * **High Priority** – urgent, time-sensitive\n     * **Work Related** – general work emails\n     * **Promotions** – newsletters, offers, sales\n     * **Other** – uncategorized emails\n   * The classifier uses a **system prompt** to ensure output is returned in JSON format for downstream processing.\n\n3. **Apply Gmail Labels**\n\n   * Based on classification, the workflow applies the corresponding Gmail label:\n\n     * **High Priority** → “Important + Starred”\n     * **Work Related** → “Work” (custom Gmail label)\n     * **Promotions** → “Promotions” (custom Gmail label)\n   * Each label must **already exist in Gmail** for the operation to work.\n\n4. **Generate Notification**\n\n   * The **AI Agent** (notification assistant) takes the classified email and rewrites it into a **short, casual notification**.\n   * Example notification:\n\n     ```\n     [High Priority] New email from client@example.com  \n     Subject: Urgent project deadline  \n     \"Please review the attached contract ASAP\"\n     ```\n\n5. **Send to Telegram**\n\n   * The **Telegram node** sends the generated notification to your personal chat ID.\n   * Requires a Telegram bot created with **@BotFather** and your **chat ID** configured.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Import this workflow into **n8n**.\n2. Set up **Gmail OAuth2 credentials** and connect your Gmail account.\n3. Create Gmail labels: `High Priority`, `Work Related`, `Promotions`.\n4. Set up a **Telegram bot** in @BotFather and copy your `chatId` into the node.\n5. Run the workflow — every new email will now be classified, labeled, and notified.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **n8n Gmail Trigger** with Gmail OAuth2 credentials\n* **OpenAI API key** configured for LangChain nodes\n* **Telegram bot** created via @BotFather with your chat ID\n* Existing Gmail labels (`Work`, `Promotions`, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n\nYou can extend it by:\n\n* **Adding more categories** – e.g., “Finance,” “Personal,” or “Spam.”\n* **Changing the notification channel** – send to Slack, Discord, or SMS instead of Telegram.\n* **Adjusting classification rules** – edit the system prompt for finer-grained AI sorting.\n* **Changing polling frequency** – set Gmail Trigger to every 5 minutes instead of every minute.\n* **Expanding extracted fields** – include attachments, links, or CC addresses in the notification.\n",
