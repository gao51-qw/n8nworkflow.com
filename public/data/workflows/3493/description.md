### Who is this for?
This workflow is ideal for administrators or IT professionals responsible for monitoring SSL certificates of multiple websites to ensure they do not expire unexpectedly.

2. Checks SSL certificates using SSL-Checker.io.
3. Updates Google Sheet with SSL details such as expiry date and certificate status.
4. Sends email alerts for SSL certificates nearing expiry (&lt;30 days) or invalid certificates.

### Setup

2. Set up Google Sheets and Gmail credentials in n8n.
3. Configure the Discourse Trigger for weekly monitoring.
4. Customize email/telegram/ntfy alert settings as needed.

### Customization

- Customize email content and recipients in the "Send Alert Email" node.
- Extend functionality by adding additional checks or actions based on SSL certificate status.

### Note
