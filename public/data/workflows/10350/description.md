# **Automate Video Generation with Sora 2 & Veo 3.1 - For Beginners**

Kick-start AI video generation in n8n with two popular paths: OpenAI Sora 2 and Google Veo 3.1 (via Wavespeed). This beginner-friendly template lets you type a prompt in Chat Trigger, then automatically:

Call Sora 2 to generate a short 720p clip and email the MP4.

Call Veo 3.1 through Wavespeed, poll until ready, and email the result link.

## 
## What this template does
Chat input → Two video routes run in parallel:
Sora 2 route: HTTP Request (POST /v1/videos) → HTTP Request (GET /videos/{id}/content) → Gmail (attach MP4).
Veo 3.1 route (Wavespeed): HTTP Request (POST /google/veo3.1/text-to-video) → poll result with HTTP Request (GET /predictions/{id}/result) inside a Wait + IF loop → Gmail (send result URL).
Includes pinned sample prompt for a marketing use case.
Uses Sticky Notes to explain each lane and link to the tutorial.

### Why it’s useful (for beginners)
No code required: fill credentials, paste your prompt, run.
Side-by-side comparison: learn how Sora 2 vs Veo 3.1 flows differ (direct file vs polled URL).
Email delivery built-in: get outputs in your inbox for quick review.

### Requirements
OpenAI API key with access to Sora 2 video endpoint.
Wavespeed API key (for Veo 3.1).
Google Gmail OAuth2 (to send yourself the results).
n8n (self-hosted or Cloud), with internet access.

Note: Replace any placeholder or demo credentials after import. Never commit real keys to public templates.

### Credentials to set in n8n
HTTP Header Auth – OpenAI Sora 2
Header Name: Authorization
Value: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
HTTP Header Auth – Wavespeed
Header Name: Authorization
Value: Bearer YOUR_WAVESPEED_API_KEY
Gmail OAuth2
Connect your Google account.
In the two Gmail nodes, change “sendTo” to your email.

### How it works (nodes overview)
When chat message received (Chat Trigger)
Receives your chatInput prompt.
Veo 3.1 lane (top)
HTTP Request — Post to Wavespeed
POST https://api.wavespeed.ai/api/v3/google/veo3.1/text-to-video
Body params (editable): aspect_ratio, duration, generate_audio, prompt, resolution.
Wait 1 Minute → HTTP Request — Get result
Polls GET /api/v3/predictions/{id}/result.
IF (status === "completed")
True → Gmail — Send Video Result to Email (sends the output URL).
False → Wait another 60 secs → back to Wait 1 Minute (poll again).
Sora 2 lane (bottom)
HTTP Request — POST /v1/videos (OpenAI)
Multipart form: prompt={{$json.chatInput}}, model="sora-2-pro", size="1280x720", seconds="8".
HTTP Request — GET /v1/videos/{id}/content
Downloads the MP4 as binary (video.mp4).
Gmail — Send Video to Email
Attaches video.mp4 and emails it to you.

### Setup (step-by-step)
Import the template into n8n.
Open each HTTP Request node and select the correct HTTP Header Auth credentials.
Open both Gmail nodes and:
Select your Gmail OAuth2 credential.
Change “sendTo” to your email.

### (Optional) Tweak defaults:
Sora 2: size (e.g., 1920x1080), seconds (e.g., 5–10).
Veo 3.1 via Wavespeed: aspect_ratio (9:16, 16:9, 1:1), duration, resolution.
Wait timing and max polling passes (add an extra IF to stop after N attempts).
Execute Workflow and enter your prompt in the Chat window.

### Customization tips
Different delivery: swap Gmail for Google Drive, Slack, or Telegram nodes.
Approval loop: after email, branch to a Slack approval step before archiving the file.
Brand presets: store common prompt fragments (tone, overlays, logo instructions) in an Item Lists/Set node and merge into the main prompt.
Content length: Sora and Veo costs/latency grow with duration—start short (5–8s), then iterate.

### Troubleshooting
403/401 errors: re-check API keys and header names (Authorization: Bearer …).
Empty Veo output: confirm polling loop runs until status = completed; inspect the GET result JSON path used in email (data.outputs[0]).
Sora content fetch fails: ensure the second GET uses the returned id path and outputs binary video.mp4.
Email not received: verify Gmail OAuth2 scope and recipient; check n8n executions for errors.
NSFW/safety blocks: refine the prompt to avoid restricted content.
