  "description": "## Video walkthrough\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwIFK-r-NtQ\n\n## Summary of agent\nThis agent can write and rewrite its own rules, allowing you to mold its behavior. It receives rules from a database as system instructions and has tools to create, edit, or delete them. This is a great baseline for new agent builds.\n\nYou can tell it things like \"Next time, use present tense when talking about this subject\" and it will use a tool to save this as a rule, then receive that instruction in all future iterations. \n\n## How to start using it\n\n### Option 1: With a Postgres database (e.g., Supabase)\n1.  **Supabase Schema:** Create a table (e.g., `agent_rules`) with the following columns:\n    *   `id`: `bigint` (Primary Key, auto-incrementing)\n    *   `created_at`: `timestamp with time zone` (Default: `now()`)\n    *   `rule_text`: `text`\n    *   `agent`: `text`\n2.  **Workflow Updates:**\n    *   Update the **Postgres credentials** in the \"Get rules from database,\" \"Insert rule into database,\" and \"Execute query on rule database\" nodes.\n    *   Update the `agent` value (currently 'TestAgent') in the \"Get rules from database\" and \"Insert rule into database\" nodes if you want a different agent name.\n    *   Update the **Anthropic API credentials**.\n\n### Option 2: With Google Sheets\n1.  **Google Sheet Setup:** Create a Google Sheet with columns for `rule_text` and `agent`.\n2.  **Workflow Updates:**\n    *   Example Google Sheets nodes are included. You will need to:\n        *   Connect your **Google Sheets credentials**.\n        *   Select your Google Sheet (with `rule_text` and `agent` columns) in all relevant Google Sheets nodes.\n        *   Replace the existing Postgres nodes (\"Get rules from database\", \"Insert rule into database\", \"Execute query on rule database\") with the configured Google Sheets nodes.\n    *   Update the `agent` value (currently 'TestAgent') in the Google Sheets nodes if you want a different agent name.\n    *   Update the **Anthropic API credentials**.\n    *   **Agent Instructions:** Update the agent's system message and remove the database schema section as it is no longer relevant",
