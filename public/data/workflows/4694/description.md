## Summary of agent
This agent can write and rewrite its own rules, allowing you to mold its behavior. It receives rules from a database as system instructions and has tools to create, edit, or delete them. This is a great baseline for new agent builds.

You can tell it things like "Next time, use present tense when talking about this subject" and it will use a tool to save this as a rule, then receive that instruction in all future iterations. 

## How to start using it

### Option 1: With a Postgres database (e.g., Supabase)
1.  **Supabase Schema:** Create a table (e.g., `agent_rules`) with the following columns:
    *   `id`: `bigint` (Primary Key, auto-incrementing)
    *   `created_at`: `timestamp with time zone` (Default: `now()`)
    *   `rule_text`: `text`
    *   `agent`: `text`
2.  **Workflow Updates:**
    *   Update the **Postgres credentials** in the "Get rules from database," "Insert rule into database," and "Execute query on rule database" nodes.
    *   Update the `agent` value (currently 'TestAgent') in the "Get rules from database" and "Insert rule into database" nodes if you want a different agent name.
    *   Update the **Anthropic API credentials**.

### Option 2: With Google Sheets
1.  **Google Sheet Setup:** Create a Google Sheet with columns for `rule_text` and `agent`.
2.  **Workflow Updates:**
    *   Example Google Sheets nodes are included. You will need to:
        *   Connect your **Google Sheets credentials**.
        *   Select your Google Sheet (with `rule_text` and `agent` columns) in all relevant Google Sheets nodes.
        *   Replace the existing Postgres nodes ("Get rules from database", "Insert rule into database", "Execute query on rule database") with the configured Google Sheets nodes.
    *   Update the `agent` value (currently 'TestAgent') in the Google Sheets nodes if you want a different agent name.
    *   Update the **Anthropic API credentials**.
    *   **Agent Instructions:** Update the agent's system message and remove the database schema section as it is no longer relevant
