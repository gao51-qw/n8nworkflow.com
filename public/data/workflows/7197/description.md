## 🧾 Who’s it for  
This workflow is designed for **finance teams**, **accountants**, and **data analysts** 📊 who want to interact with financial data from **two PostgreSQL databases** — one containing **Profit & Loss** data and another containing **Balance Sheet** data — using natural language chat.  
It’s perfect for those who need **quick, AI-powered insights** with the correct database automatically selected based on the question.

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does  
1. **Chat Trigger 💬** – Starts the workflow when a chat message is received.  
2. **AI Agent 🤖** – Processes the user’s question and decides:  
   - **Profit & Loss DB** → If the question is about revenue, costs, expenses, or profit.  
   - **Balance Sheet DB** → If the question is about assets, liabilities, or equity.  
3. **PostgreSQL Query Nodes 🗄️** –  
   - **P_L_Reports** queries the `financial_agent_pl_reports` table.  
   - **Balance_Sheets** queries the `financial_agent_balancesheets` table.  
4. **AI Model (OpenAI) 🧠** – Uses `gpt-4.1-nano` to interpret results and provide an easy-to-read answer.  
5. **Memory Buffer 📝** – Keeps recent conversation context for a smoother chat experience.  
6. **Table Output 📋** – Always formats the results as a **clean, readable table** with two decimal precision.

## 🛠️ How to set up  
1. **Prepare Your Databases**  
   - Feed your Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet data into **PostgreSQL**.  
   - Ensure the correct table structures are used:  
     - **financial_agent_pl_reports** → P&L data.  
     - **financial_agent_balancesheets** → Balance Sheet data.  

2. **Configure the PostgreSQL Nodes**  
   - Add connection credentials for both databases.  
   - Link **P_L_Reports** and **Balance_Sheets** nodes to the correct tables.  

3. **Set Up the AI Agent**  
   - Paste the provided **system message** into the AI Agent node (already configured in your workflow).  

4. **Connect the Nodes**  
   - Ensure **Chat Trigger → AI Agent → DB Nodes → AI Model** connections match your workflow.  

5. **Deploy**  
   - Save and activate the workflow.  
   - Start sending finance-related queries to test.
