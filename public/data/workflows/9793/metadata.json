Customize Your Search Criteria\nIn the \"Set Search Criteria\" node, modify these parameters to match your job preferences: \n\nsearch_keywords: Job titles to search for (comma-separated)\n\nDefault: senior product designer, product design lead, senior UX designer, AI designer\n\nexcluded_keywords: Terms to filter out (comma-separated)\n\nDefault: contract, freelance\n\nlocation: Where you want to work (comma-separated)\n\nDefault: remote, san francisco\n\nf_TPR: Time filter for job postings\n\nr86400 = Last 24 hours\nr604800 = Last week\nr2592000 = Last month\n\nsortBy: How to sort results\n\nDD = Most recent first\nR = Most relevant first\n\n✅ 4.
