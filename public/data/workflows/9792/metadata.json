  "description": "## Who’s it for\nThis workflow is for **system administrators** or **self-hosted n8n users** who want to **automatically check and update their n8n instance** to the latest version — with Telegram notifications for every step.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n1. The workflow runs **daily at 9 AM** or every time n8n starts.\n2. It retrieves your **current version** using the Execute Command node.\n3. It checks the **latest release** from the official n8n GitHub API.\n4. It compares both versions and decides whether an update is needed.\n5. If an update is available:\n   - Sends a **Telegram alert**.\n   - Verifies that there are **no running executions**.\n   - Runs the update command safely.\n   - Sends a confirmation message when done.\n6. If your instance is already up to date, it sends a “latest version” message instead.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- **Self-hosted n8n** instance with access to run terminal commands.\n- A valid **Telegram Bot API credential** (configured in n8n Credentials; not hardcoded).\n- **SSH credentials**\nTo run commands on the server where n8n is installed\n- **n8n API credentials**\nTo query running executions\n\n\n---\n\n## How to set up\n1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n2. Connect your **Telegram Bot credential** to the Telegram nodes.\n3. Adjust the **chat ID** and **message thread ID** if needed.\n4. (Optional) Change the **schedule time** in the Schedule Trigger node.\n5. Save and activate the workflow.\n\n---\n\n## How to customize\n- Change the update command if you’re running n8n via Docker:\n  ```bash\n  docker pull n8nio/n8n:latest\n",
