## Step-by-Step: How This Workflow Automates Voice Reminders

1. Trigger the Workflow – The system runs manually or on a schedule to check upcoming appointments in **Google Calendar**.
2. Retrieve Appointment Data – It **fetches event details** (client name, time, and location) from Google Calendar.
The workflow uses the summary, start.dateTime, location, and attendees[0].email fields from Google Calendar to personalize and send the voice reminders.
3. **Generate a Voice Reminder** – Using [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/text-audio), the workflow converts the appointment details into a natural-sounding voice message.
4. **Send via Email** – The generated audio file is attached to an email and sent to the client as a reminder.

## Customization: Tailor the Workflow to Your Business Needs

- Adjust Trigger Frequency – Modify the scheduling to run daily, hourly, or at specific intervals.
- Customize Voice Message Format – Change the script structure and voice tone to match your business needs.
- Change Notification Method – Instead of email, integrate SMS or WhatsApp for delivery.
