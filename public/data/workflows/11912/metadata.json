  "description": "## How it works\n\nThe workflow detects incoming job-application emails, extracts resumes, and parses them for AI analysis. It evaluates each candidate against three open roles and assigns a fit score with structured reasoning. Low-scoring applicants are stored for review, while strong candidates move into an automated scheduling flow. The system checks availability on the next business day, books the slot, sends a confirmation email, and records all details in Airtable.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n### Detect and collect job-application data\n- **Gmail Trigger1** – Monitors inbox for all new emails.\n- **Message a model2** – Classifies whether the email is a job application.\n- **If2** – Continues only when the AI result is YES.\n- **Get a message1** – Fetches the full message and attachments.\n- **Upload file1** – Uploads the resume to Google Drive.\n- **Extract from File1** – Converts the PDF resume into text.\n\n### Analyze the resume and evaluate fit\n- **Available Positions1** – Defines the three open roles.\n- **Message a model3** – Produces recommended role, fit score, strengths, gaps, skills, and reasoning.\n- **If3** – Routes candidates based on `fit_score ≥ 8`.\n- **Create a record3** – Stores lower-scoring applicants in Airtable.\n- **Get Next Business Day1** – Calculates the schedule window for qualified candidates.\n\n### Check availability on the next business day\n- **AI Agent1** – Orchestrates availability search using calendar nodes.\n- **Get Events1** – Retrieves events for the target day.\n- **Check Availability1** – Evaluates free 1-hour slots.\n- **OpenAI Chat Model2** – Reasoning engine for the agent.\n- **Structured Output Parser1** – Returns clean JSON with `start_time` and `end_time`.\n- **OpenAI Chat Model3** – Supports structured parsing.\n\n### Schedule the interview and notify the candidate\n- **Create an event1** – Books the interview in Google Calendar.\n- **Send a message1** – Sends an HTML confirmation email to the candidate.\n- **Create a record2** – Saves shortlisted candidate and interview data in Airtable.\n\n---\n\n## Why use this?\n\n- Removes manual screening by automating email intake and resume parsing.\n- Ensures consistent AI-based role matching and scoring.\n- Books interviews automatically using real calendar availability.\n- Keeps all applicant and scheduling data organized in Airtable.\n- Provides a fully hands-off, end-to-end hiring pipeline.\n",
