### Who is this for?

This workflow is perfect for marketers, SEO specialists, product teams, and competitive analysts who want to monitor and summarize public reviews of their competitors. It’s especially helpful for small teams who want fast insights from Google reviews without spending hours manually reading and sorting them.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually going through competitor reviews is time-consuming and repetitive. You risk missing patterns or insights, and it’s hard to share summaries with your team quickly. This workflow automatically scrapes reviews from Google and generates a structured summary of pain points and positive feedback. That way, you can focus on strategy instead of sorting through dozens of reviews.

### What this workflow does

This automation watches for new competitor entries in a Google Sheet, then:

1. Uses **Dumpling AI** to scrape the latest Google reviews (up to 20) for each business.
2. Splits and cleans the reviews for analysis.
3. Sends them to **GPT-4o**, which summarizes the most common complaints and praises.
4. Saves the structured result back to the same Google Sheet.

You’ll instantly get an overview of what people are saying about any competitor.
