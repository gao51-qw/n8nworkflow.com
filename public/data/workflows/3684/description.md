### Context

Hey! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

We use **AI, automation, and data** to support sustainable business practices for small, medium and large companies.

I use this workflow to bring **awareness about sustainability** and **promote my business** by delivering automated daily news digests.

&gt; Promote your business with a fully automated newsletter powered by AI!

This n8n workflow scrapes articles from the official EU news website and sends a **daily curated digest**, highlighting only the **most relevant sustainability news**.
