### Who this is for?
Indeed Data Scraper & Summarization with Airtable, Bright Data and Google Gemini is an automated workflow that extracts company profile information from Indeed using Bright Data Web Unlocker, transforms the data using Google Gemini's LLM, and forward the transformed response with the summary to a specified webhook for downstream use.

This workflow is tailored for:

- Recruiters and HR teams who want quick summaries of companies listed on Indeed.

- Market researchers and analysts needing structured insights into businesses.

- Founders, investors, and consultants scouting potential competitors, partners, or clients.

- No-code enthusiasts looking to automate data extraction and enrichment pipelines without manual scraping or parsing.

- Cleaning and summarizing the extracted content using Google Gemini LLM.

- Storing structured insights directly into Airtable for easy access and further workflows.

- Eliminates manual research, saves hours, and produces AI-enhanced, easily searchable records.
