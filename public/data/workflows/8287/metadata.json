  "description": "### Who’s it for  \nThis template is for businesses, customer support teams, and professionals who want to deliver **AI-powered WhatsApp assistance**. It helps automate conversations, schedule meetings, answer FAQs, and send follow-up emails — all from WhatsApp.  \n\n### How it works  \n- A customer sends a WhatsApp message, which is captured by the **Twilio Trigger**.  \n- The incoming text is formatted and passed to the **AI Support Agent**.  \n- Based on the request, the agent can:  \n  - Manage Google Calendar events (create, list, delete).  \n  - Answer questions from your knowledge base (Supabase + embeddings).  \n  - Draft and send emails via Gmail.  \n  - Reply directly on WhatsApp with the appropriate response.  \n\n### How to set up  \n1. Connect your **Twilio account** with WhatsApp enabled.  \n2. Add your **OpenAI API key**.  \n3. Connect **Google Calendar**.  \n4. Connect **Gmail**.  \n5. Configure **Supabase** for knowledge base storage.  \n\n### Requirements  \n- Twilio account (with WhatsApp number)  \n- OpenAI API key  \n- Google Calendar  \n- Gmail account  \n- Supabase project  \n\n### How to customize  \n- Update the **Set Fields node** with your Twilio number, API keys, and Gmail details.  \n- Add custom documents to Supabase for domain-specific FAQs.  \n- Adjust AI prompts for different roles (e.g., booking bot, HR assistant, customer support).  \n- Extend by adding more tools (CRM, Slack, Notion, etc.) as needed.  \n\n![Whatsapp Text Agent.png](fileId:2315)",
