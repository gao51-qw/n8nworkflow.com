**Create, iterate, and share! Transform a single image through multiple scenes while maintaining consistency.**

## ✨ What this workflow does

This template showcases **FLUX.1 Kontext** - [Black Forest Labs' in-context image generation model](https://bfl.ai/announcements/flux-1-kontext) that excels at maintaining character features across multiple transformations. Combined with the [Upload Post community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-upload-post) for effortless multi-platform social media posting, you can create and share compelling visual stories instantly.

The workflow demonstrates FLUX Kontext's core strength: **character consistency across multiple image generations**. Starting with a single input image, it:
1. 🖼️ **Loads an initial character image** (example: a cute animal mascot)
2. 📝 **Defines multiple scene transformation prompts** 
3. 🔄 **Iteratively generates new scenes** while preserving exact character features
4. 🎯 **Maintains visual consistency** by reusing binary data from previous generations
5. 📱 **Auto-posts the complete transformation series** to multiple social platforms simultaneously

## 🚀 Key Features: The Consistency Advantage

- **Character Preservation**: FLUX Kontext's signature feature - maintains character features and style across transformations (requires specific prompting techniques)
- **Iterative Context Building**: Each generation uses the previous image as context, creating visual continuity
- **Binary Data Reuse**: Smart workflow design that feeds output from one generation as input to the next
- **Multi-Scene Storytelling**: Transform your character across different environments while keeping them recognizable
- **One-Click Multi-Platform Posting**: [Upload Post](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=post-now&tenantId=upload-post-app)* eliminates the tedious process of posting to each platform individually

## 📱 Why use Upload Post?
