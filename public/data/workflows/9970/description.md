### This n8n workflow lets you delegate inbox management to an AI agent. It automatically replies to emails when a suitable response is found in your knowledge base. If no match is found, the message is forwarded to a human for review. This ensures all replies follow company guidelines and prevent misinformation or misrepresentation.

## Use Case
Ideal for businesses that receive frequent inquiries about products or services and want to automate responses, freeing up time to focus on core operations.

## How It Works
- Polls your inbox for new incoming emails  
- Cleans HTML to reduce token usage and filters spam  
- Categorizes emails for better organization  
- Retrieves conversation history from Supabase (if available) to give the AI proper context  
- Uses the AI agent to query your FAQ database for relevant answers  
- Replies automatically if a suitable answer is found  
- Sends a placeholder email and forwards to a human if no accurate answer exists  
- Ingests all processed emails into Supabase to retain conversation history and improve future AI accuracy  

## Customization
You can connect any email provider or LLM model. The workflow can also be expanded to let the AI schedule meetings, answer availability questions, or handle other inbox tasks.
