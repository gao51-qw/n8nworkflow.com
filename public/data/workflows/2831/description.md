### Optimized Airtable Bulk Data Workflow

This workflow is specifically designed to address the challenges of upserting or inserting large volumes of data into Airtable. By leveraging the Airtable Batch API, it delivers up to **9X faster performance** compared to standard data insertion methods, making it an indispensable tool for high-demand data operations.

### Key Features
•	Accelerated Data Processing:
Utilize the Airtable Batch API to perform bulk operations swiftly and efficiently.
•	Seamless Workflow Integration:
Easily integrate this sub-processor into any n8n workflow that requires Airtable updates, ensuring smooth data synchronization across multiple processes.
•	Enhanced Reliability and Scalability:
Designed to handle extensive datasets, this solution is perfect for real-time updates, database migrations, and continuous data syncing without performance degradation.

### Setup Instructions
1.	**Add the Sub-Workflow:**
Import this workflow to your n8n workflows, then add it as a sub-workflow call in other workflows requiring a lot of Airtable updates.
2.	**Configure Sub-Worflow variables:
`"set_Batching_vars" SET Node`**
•	Obtain the correct Base ID and Table ID, and insert in the "set_Batching_vars" SET Node.

•	Ensure the API permissions are set correctly to allow data insertion/upsertion.
3.	**Adjust Batch Settings:
`"set_Batching_vars" SET Node`**
•	In the same "set_Batching_vars" SET Node, put the field name in the "merge_on" field if you wish to upsert record, otherwise, keep it empty for insertion.
