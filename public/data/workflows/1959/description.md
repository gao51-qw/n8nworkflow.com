This workflow is designed for dynamic and intelligent conversational capabilities. It incorporates OpenAI's GPT-4o model for natural language understanding and generation. Additional tools include SerpAPI and Wikipedia for enriched, data-driven responses. The workflow is triggered manually, and utilizes a 'Window Buffer Memory' to maintain the context of the last 20 interactions for better conversational continuity. All these components are orchestrated through n8n nodes, ensuring seamless interconnectivity.

To use this template, you need to be on n8n version 1.50.0 or later.
