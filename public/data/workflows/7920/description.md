No more writer's block, no more SEO guesswork, just high-quality content that ranks and engages your audience

## 🔧 Workflow Architecture & Process
**How the AI Agents Work Together**
This N8N workflow implements a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate through structured data exchange. The workflow uses HTTP Request nodes to communicate with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, integrates with Brave Search for real-time research, and connects to Ghost CMS via REST API calls. Each agent operates independently but shares data through N8N's workflow context, ensuring seamless information flow from research to publication. The system includes error handling, retry logic, and quality gates at each stage to maintain content standards.
