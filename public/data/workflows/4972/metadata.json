  "description": "This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis workflow is a simple AI Agent that connects to Langfuse so send tracing data to help monitor LLM interactions.\n\nThe main idea is to create a custom LLM model that allows the configuration of callbacks, which are used by langchain to connect applications such Langfuse.\n\nThis is achieves by using the \"langchain code\" node:\n- Connects a LLM model sub-node to obtain the model variables (model name, temp and provider) - Creates a generic langchain initChatModel with the model parameters.\n- Return the LLM to be used by the AI Agent node.\n\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n- Langfuse instance (cloud or self-hosted) with API credentials\n- LLM API key (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n- n8n &gt;= 1.98.0 (required for LangChain code node support in AI Agent)\n\n## ⚙️ Setup\n\n1. Add these to your n8n instance:\n```bash\n# Langfuse configuration\nLANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key\nLANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key\nLANGFUSE_BASEURL=https://cloud.langfuse.com  # or your self-hosted URL\n\n# LLM API key (example for Gemini)\nGOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key\n```\n\nAlternative: Configure these directly in the LangChain code node if you prefer not to use environment variables\n\n2. Import the workflow JSON\n\n3. Connect your preferred LLM model node\n\n4. Send a test message to verify tracing appears in Langfuse\n",
