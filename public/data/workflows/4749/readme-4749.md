## 👥 Who is this for?

This template is ideal for:

* Online stores with simple checkout flows
* Sellers of digital products or info-courses
* Entrepreneurs using Telegram bots or web forms

## 🎯 What problem does this workflow solve?

Setting up online payments usually requires backend infrastructure. This no-code solution automates the entire payment flow:

* Handles product listing and price retrieval
* Initiates payments with email and return URL
* Listens for `payment.succeeded` and `refund.succeeded` events
* Records every action into structured Google Sheets

## ⚙️ What this workflow does

### 1. **GET /products**

Returns a sorted list of products from a Google Sheet (`products`).

### 2. **POST /payment**

* Validates required fields (`product_id`, `email`, `return_url`)
* Checks email format
* Fetches product data from `products`
* Generates a unique idempotence key
* Sends a request to YooKassa API
* Saves the order into the `orders` sheet
* Returns a payment confirmation link

### 3. **POST /yoomoney**

Webhook to process payment/refund events:

* On `payment.succeeded`, adds entry to `transactions`
* On `refund.succeeded`, updates transaction status

### 4. **GET /status/\:id**

Returns real-time payment status from YooKassa

## 🚀 Setup

1. **Connect credentials:**

   * Google Sheets (OAuth2)
   * YooKassa (Basic Auth using `shopId` and `secretKey`)

   * `products`: should contain `product_id`, `title`, `price`
   * `orders`: for saving confirmed purchases
   * `transactions`: for logging all successful or refunded payments

3. **Test endpoints using any HTTP client**:

Example payload for `/payment`:

```json
{
  "product_id": "abc123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "return_url": "https://your.site/success"
}
```
