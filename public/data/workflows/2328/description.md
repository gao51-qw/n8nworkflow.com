This n8n workflow demonstrates how you can summarise and automate post-meeting actions from video transcripts fed into an AI Agent.

Save time between meetings by allowing AI handle the chores of organising follow-up meetings and invites.

## How it works
* This workflow scans for the calendar for client or team meetings which were held online. * Attempts will be made to fetch any recorded transcripts which are then sent to the AI agent.
* The AI agent summarises and identifies if any follow-on meetings are required.
* If found, the Agent will use its Calendar Tool to to create the event for the time, date and place for the next meeting as well as add known attendees.

## Requirements
* Google Calendar and the ability to fetch Meeting Transcripts (There is a special OAuth permission for this action!)
* OpenAI account for access to the LLM.

## Customising the workflow

This example only books follow-on meetings but could be extended to generate reports or send emails.
