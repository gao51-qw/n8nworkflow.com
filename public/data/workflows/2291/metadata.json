  "description": "## Who is this template for?\nThis workflow template is designed for **Marketing** and pre-**Sales** to get prospects from a form like Tally, decline data in the famous opensource CRM (SuiteCRM), synchronize contact in Brevo with linking the id from CRM, and then notify in NextCloud.\n\nBonus : validate email with ++CaptainVerify++ and notify in NextCloud depending on response\n\n## How it works\nFor each submission in the form, a webhook is triggered.\nA check of the email is done with CaptainVerify. Depending on the response, and if it is ok, then a Lead is created in SuiteCRM. Else, a message in your selected discussion is sent.\nAs the lead has been created, we can create a contact in Brevo (for future campain), ank link this contact with the lead_id from the CRM in a dedicated field.\nFinaly, a message in your selected discussion in NextCloud informs you about the lead.\n\n## Set up instructions\nComplete the Set up credentials step when you first open the workflow. You'll need a CaptainVerify account (Api Key), a dedicated SuiteCRM user with Oauth, a Brevo account (Api Key) and a Nextcloud account.\nSet up the Webhook in the form's tool of your choice (why not Tally ?).\nSet each node with the explanations in sticky Notes.\nEnjoy !\n\nTemplate was created in n8n **v1.44.1**\n\n",
