**How it works**

This advanced workflow transforms your long-form audio content (like podcast episodes or webinar recordings) into digestible, ready-to-use marketing assets. It's designed for podcasters, content creators, and marketers who want to maximize their content's reach. It automatically:

- Takes a full transcript of your audio/video content as input.

- Generates a concise, comprehensive summary of the episode using advanced AI.

- Extracts a list of key topics and keywords from the transcript, perfect for SEO, tagging, and content categorization.

- Delivers the summary and keywords directly to your inbox or a connected tool for easy access.

Streamline your content repurposing pipeline and unlock new value from your audio and video assets with intelligent automation!

**Set up steps**

Setting up this powerful workflow typically takes around 20-30 minutes, as it involves multiple AI steps. You'll need to:

- Obtain API keys for your preferred AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).

- Have access to a method for generating transcripts from your audio/video (e.g., manually pasting, or using a separate transcription service like AssemblyAI, Whisper, etc.).

- Connect your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail) to receive the output.

All detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.
