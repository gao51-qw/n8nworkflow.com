It's designed for podcasters, content creators, and marketers who want to maximize their content's reach. It automatically:\n\n- Takes a full transcript of your audio/video content as input.\n\n- Generates a concise, comprehensive summary of the episode using advanced AI.\n\n- Extracts a list of key topics and keywords from the transcript, perfect for SEO, tagging, and content categorization.\n\n- Delivers the summary and keywords directly to your inbox or a connected tool for easy access.\n\nStreamline your content repurposing pipeline and unlock new value from your audio and video assets with intelligent automation!\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nSetting up this powerful workflow typically takes around 20-30 minutes, as it involves multiple AI steps. You'll need to:\n\n- Obtain API keys for your preferred AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).\n\n- Have access to a method for generating transcripts from your audio/video (e.g., manually pasting, or using a separate transcription service like AssemblyAI, Whisper, etc.).\n\n- Connect your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail) to receive the output.\n\nAll detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.",
