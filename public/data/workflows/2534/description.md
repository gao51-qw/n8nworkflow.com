## Free template for voice & text messages with short-term memory 
 
This n8n workflow template is a blueprint for an AI Telegram bot that processes both voice and text messages. Ready to use with minimal setup. 
 
The bot remembers the last several messages (10 by default), understands commands and provides responses in HTML. 
 
You can easily swap GPT-4 and Whisper for other language and speech-to-text models to suit your needs. 
 
### Core Features 
   - Text: send or forward messages 
   - Voice: transcription via Whisper
