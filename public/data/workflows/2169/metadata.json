  "title": "Watchdog: Update All Workflows With Default Error Workflow",
  "description": "Do you consistently *forget* to set a Default Error Workflow when creating new workflows?  Then this helper workflow is for you!\n\nWhen activated, this helper workflow will:\n* Scan ALL other workflows every 4 hours\n* Make sure ALL workflows have a default error workflow set (based on what Workflow ID you provide)\n* This helper will SKIP OVER any workflows that have the `default_error:false` tag set (make sure your default error workflow has the `default_error:false` tag set, so that you don't end up with recursive loops during errors)\n\nSetup Nodes:\n* Once imported, edit the `Set Vars` node with your `default_error_workflow_id` value.\n* If you want to change the `default_error:false` tag to some other tag name, you can do so here as well.\n* You need to update the `Set Default Error Workflow` node with your PostgreSQL credentials to access the `n8n` database.",
