  "description": "  **Get Started\n**\n\nCreator: @obisdev\n\nThis workflow powers a fully automated WhatsApp chatbot using a self-hosted Venom Bot instead of the official WhatsApp Business API. It integrates Google Gemini AI to generate intelligent, conversational responses and optionally pulls factual information from a Google Docs-based knowledge base. Designed for small businesses and creators, the bot can maintain contextual memory across messages and act as a smart virtual assistant for sales, support, and lead generation.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis n8n workflow connects with a custom-hosted Venom Bot that simulates WhatsApp Web to send and receive messages. It uses a Webhook trigger to receive incoming messages, processes them with an AI Agent powered by Gemini, optionally pulls extra data from a Google Doc or Google Sheet, and sends a smart reply back through the Venom Bot. The workflow also includes a memory system to retain user context, making it capable of handling follow-up questions and dynamic conversations.\n\n**Who this workflow is for**\n\nSmall Business Owners:\nOffer 24/7 customer service on WhatsApp without paying for Meta’s Business API.\n\nFreelancers & Developers:\nBuild, test, and monetize intelligent bots without the approval process of WhatsApp’s API.\n\nOnline Sellers & Creators:\nHandle FAQs, orders, and customer inquiries via WhatsApp on autopilot.\n\nMarketers:\nDeploy campaign bots that respond to DMs with personalized product suggestions or lead captures.\n\nHackers & Builders:\nExperiment with unofficial APIs to control WhatsApp reliably without breaking TOS for small-scale use.\n\n**Tools Used**\nn8n: The automation platform managing flow, context, and decision logic.\n\nVenom Bot: A Node.js-based, self-hosted WhatsApp Web bot used to send/receive messages.\n\nGoogle Gemini: AI engine for generating context-aware replies.\n\nGoogle Docs (Optional): Acts as a structured knowledge base for business info or FAQs.\n\nGoogle Sheets (Optional): Feeds real-time or structured data into your AI responses.\n\n**How to Install**\n\nImport the Workflow: Download the .json and import it into your n8n instance.\n\nSet Up Venom Bot: Deploy Venom Bot (on VPS or local) and set it to send messages to your Webhook URL.\n\nWebhook Configuration: Update the Webhook node in n8n and set 'Respond' to \"Using Respond to Webhook Node\".\n\nConnect Google Gemini: Add your Gemini API key in n8n credentials.\n\nSet Up Google Docs (Optional): Link the document containing your knowledge base.\n\nEnable Conversational Memory: Use ={{ $(\"Process Message\").first().json.from }} as the session ID.\n\nCheck API Key Matching: Ensure the API_SECRET_KEY in Venom .env matches the authorization header in n8n.\n\nCustomize Persona & Prompts: Update the AI Agent system message to fit your brand tone.\n\nUse Cases\nCustomer service without WhatsApp Business API\n\nSmart lead generation bots\n\nE-commerce order responders\n\nAI-powered chatbot for DMs\n\nFAQ responder with knowledge base support\n\nConnect with Me\nEmail: obisdev@gmail.com\nTwitter/X: @obisdev\nGitHub: github.com/obisdev\nVisit: obisdev.vercel.app\n\n#n8n #whatsappautomation #venombot #chatbots #noapi #geminiapi #googleworkspace #aiassistant #nocode #vpsautomation #chatbotwithoutapi #automationtools #customerbot #salesautomation #googleintegration\n\n",
