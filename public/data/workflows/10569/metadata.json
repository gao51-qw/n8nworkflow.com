Replace the dummy Folder ID and Dartboard ID with your actual target IDs.\n5.  Choose your preferred AI model for generating the summaries.\n\n## Requirements\n* n8n account\n* Connected Dart account\n* Connected Fathom account (with access to API webhooks)\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n* Edit the AI prompt to adjust the tone, style, or format of the meeting summaries.\n* Add, remove, or change the summary sections to match your needs (e.g., Key Takeaways, Action Items, Next Items).",
