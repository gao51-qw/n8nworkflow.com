## This workflow processes emails received in Gmail and adds the sender's **name** and **email address** to a MySQL database.

## Use Cases:
- A sales or marketing agency can use this to automatically save client contact info to a database to build a list of leads
- Companies can use this to automatically save contacts to a database in case of Gmail data loss / losing access to their Gmail account
- Companies can build mailing lists to automatically send promotions to all of the clients who have contacted them in a given time period

## Before using, you need to have:
- Gmail credential
- MySQL database credential
- A Table in the MySQL database to store your contacts
- The table should have a "name" column, which allows NULL values
- The table should have an "email" column, which should be UNIQUE

## How it works:
- The Gmail Trigger will listen for a new email every minute
- For each email, the code node will extract the name and email address of the sender. If there is no name, it will return null
- The MySQL node will insert the new contact into a table in your database
- If the contact email already exists in your database, the MySQL node will update the contact name


## How to use:
- Please set up the MySQL node by selecting the correct table to store contacts in
- Please choose your "email" column to match on
- Please choose your "name" column to store names

## Customizing this Workflow:
- You can customize this workflow to save more data to MySQL. Here are some examples:
- In the MySQL node, click "Add Value", and choose one of the fields from the Gmail node to save in your database column. You can try saving the following items:
  - Subject line
  - MessageID
  - ThreadID
  - Snippet
  - Recipient Info
