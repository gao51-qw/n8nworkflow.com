  "description": "## 📌 Who’s it for\n\nThis template is designed for **campaigners, researchers, and organizers who need to enrich spreadsheets of contacts with publicly available social media profiles**. Ideal for advocacy campaigns, outreach, or digital organizing where fast, scalable people lookup is needed.\n\n## ⚙️ What it does\n\nThis workflow scans a Google Sheet for rows marked as unanalysed (`\"Analysed?\" = false`), sends each contact to a dedicated AI-powered research agent, and returns structured public profile links across major platforms like:\n\n- Twitter/X  \n- LinkedIn  \n- Facebook  \n- Instagram  \n- GitHub  \n- TikTok  \n- YouTube  \n- Reddit  \n- Threads  \n- Medium  \n- Substack  \n- And more (18+ total)\n\nIt processes one contact per run for clarity and stability, appending the results back to the original Google Sheet.\n\n## 🛠️ How to set it up\n\n1. **Copy the [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nZ8a7MCU-Ku99cRsBkyer-zUPUb-QcMBzovzU3E-IH4/edit?usp=sharing)**  \n   → This sheet includes sample columns and headers for contacts and social profile fields.\n2. Paste your contact list at the end of the sheet.\n3. For each new contact, make sure the **\"Analysed?\"** column is set to `false`.\n4. Clone this workflow and [the AI Research Agent subworkflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/5588-multi-tool-research-agent-for-animal-advocacy-with-openrouter-serper-and-open-paws-db/).\n5. Connect your Google Sheets account in n8n.\n6. Update the workflow with your sheet ID and sheet name (`Sheet1` by default).\n7. Trigger the workflow on a schedule (e.g. every 15 minutes) or run it manually.\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- **Google Sheets integration** set up in n8n\n- Access to [this AI research subworkflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/5588-multi-tool-research-agent-for-animal-advocacy-with-openrouter-serper-and-open-paws-db/)  \n- OpenRouter API key\n- n8n (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n## 🧩 How to customize the workflow\n\n- Modify the research agent to prioritize specific platforms or return only verified profiles.\n- Add more profile columns to the Google Sheet and schema to match your custom fields.\n- Add logic to send alerts (email, Slack, etc.) for specific contacts.\n- Use an n8n webhook instead of a schedule to run the process on demand.\n- Use a loop over all items to process all rows sequentially (only recommended for small datasets due to memory constraints)",
