**How it works:**

1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow is initiated via a webhook, allowing you to trigger it manually or integrate it with other systems (e.g., a form submission with your desired job title and resume).
2.  **Resume Extraction:** Your uploaded resume (e.g., PDF) is automatically extracted into a readable text format.
3.  **Job Search (Adzuna API):** Using the provided job title, the workflow queries the Adzuna API to fetch relevant job postings.
4.  **Job Filtering:** Duplicate job listings are filtered out to ensure you receive unique opportunities.
5.  **Job Info Extraction:** Key details like job description, company name, and job URL are extracted from each posting.
6.  **Skills Extraction (AI):** An AI model (OpenRouter) analyzes the job description to identify the top skills and qualifications required.
7.  **Resume Match Scoring (AI):** Your resume is compared against the extracted job skills by an AI model, generating a compatibility score (1-5).
8.  **Conditional Resume & Cover Letter Generation:**
    * **If the resume match score is satisfactory (≥ 3):**
        * **Tailored Resume Generation (AI):** An AI model rewrites your resume, specifically highlighting the skills and experience most relevant to the target job, in an ATS-friendly and human-readable JSON/HTML format.
        * **Personalized Cover Letter Generation (AI):** A custom cover letter is drafted by AI, uniquely tailored to the job description and your newly optimized resume, generated as well-formatted HTML.
9.  **Google Sheets Integration:** The generated cover letter, tailored resume, job URL, and application status are automatically updated in your designated Google Sheet for easy tracking.
10. **Gmail Notification:** A personalized email containing the generated cover letter, tailored resume, and a direct link to the job posting on Adzuna is sent to your specified email address.
11. **Webhook Response:** A final text response is sent back via the webhook, summarizing the sent application materials.
