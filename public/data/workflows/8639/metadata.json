  "description": "# 🎙️ Audio-to-Insights Workflow (Form Upload + Google Drive Link)\n\n## Description\nThis workflow enables seamless **speech-to-text transcription, AI-powered summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated email delivery**.  \nIt supports two different input modes:\n\n- **Form Upload (Local File)**\n- **Form Submission (Google Drive Link)**\n\n---\n\n## How it Works\n1. **Input**\n   - Form 1: Upload an audio file (e.g., .mp3,.wav,.mp4)\n   - Form 2: Submit a Google Drive link\n\n2. **File Handling**\n   - Local uploads go directly to AssemblyAI.\n   - Drive links are parsed → File ID extracted → File fetched → Sent to AssemblyAI.\n\n3. **Transcription**\n   - AssemblyAI generates transcript text with punctuation and highlights.\n   - Workflow loops with `Wait + If` until transcript status = `completed`.\n\n4. **AI Analysis**\n   - Transcript is passed to OpenAI.\n   - Generates a structured output including:\n     - Executive summary\n     - Sentiment label & score\n     - Key points\n     - Action items\n     - Notable quotes\n     - Topics\n\n5. **Email Delivery**\n   - A formatted email is sent via Gmail with the summary and insights.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n- Dual input support: Google Drive OR direct upload\n- Handles long-running jobs with `Wait + If` polling\n- AI-powered transcript analysis with structured JSON\n- Automated sentiment scoring and summary generation\n- Professional HTML email reports\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- AssemblyAI API Key – transcription\n- Google Drive OAuth2 – file fetch\n- OpenAI API Key – summarization & sentiment analysis\n- Gmail OAuth2 – email delivery\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n2. Add and configure the required credentials.\n3. Update placeholders for:\n   - AssemblyAI API Key\n   - Google Drive Link\n   - Gmail ID\n4. Trigger via either form (local file or Google Drive link).\n5. 5.For long recordings, split before uploading (10–20 min per chunk, 2–5s overlap).Keep audio consistent (e.g., WAV/MP3, 16 kHz mono if possible).Process chunks sequentially and combine summaries/action items at the end.\n---\n\n## Customising this Workflow\n- Adjust the OpenAI prompt to fit your reporting style (executive summary, bullet points, etc.).\n- Extend email formatting with logos or branding.\n- Add Slack, CRM, or Notion integrations for distribution.\n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n- Meeting or lecture transcription with summaries\n- Podcast analysis with highlights and quotes\n- Business call reviews with action item extraction\n- Academic seminar notes emailed automatically\n",
