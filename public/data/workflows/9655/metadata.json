A Bug is Reported 🐛\n\n* **Trigger:** The entire process kicks off when a user submits a bug report through a **JotForm**. This form collects the user's name, email, and a description of the bug.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The AI Agent Gets to Work 🤖\n\n* **Action:** The submitted bug description is sent to an **AI Agent** powered by Google Gemini.\n* **Intelligence:** The agent has a clear set of instructions:\n    1.  **Check for Duplicates:** It first connects to a specific GitHub repository (`iamvaar-dev/pomodoro-timer`) and checks if an issue matching the bug description already exists.\n    2.  **Create a New Issue:** If it's a new bug (not found on GitHub), the agent automatically creates a new issue in the repository.\n    3.  **Report Back:** The agent then neatly packages its findings into a structured JSON format, noting the issue's details and whether it was already present on GitHub.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Log Everything in Google Sheets 📝\n\n* **Action:** The information from the JotForm submission and the AI Agent's analysis is sent to a **Google Sheet**.\n* **Purpose:** This step creates a clean log of all submitted bugs, including who submitted them and whether a new GitHub issue was created for them.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Prepare a Smart Notification 📣\n\n* **Action:** A small piece of **JavaScript code** runs to create a custom notification message.\n* **Logic:** The message is dynamic:\n    * If the bug was **already on GitHub**, the message will say something like, \"An issue was submitted, but it's already reported. No action is needed.\" ✅\n    * If the bug was **new**, the message will be more urgent, like, \"A new bug was reported and an issue has been created on GitHub. Please review it.\" ❗\n\n---\n\n### 5. Send the Alert via Telegram 📲\n\n* **Final Step:** The custom message created in the previous step is sent to a specific **Telegram chat** using a bot. This instantly notifies the relevant people about the new bug report and what action (if any) is required.",
