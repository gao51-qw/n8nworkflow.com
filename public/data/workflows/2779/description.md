# What this workflow does
- Monitors Google Drive: The workflow triggers whenever a new CSV file is uploaded.
- Uses AI to Identify PII Columns: The OpenAI node analyzes the data and identifies PII-containing columns (e.g., name, email, phone).
- Removes PII: The workflow filters out these columns from the dataset.
- Uploads Cleaned File: The sanitized file is renamed and re-uploaded to Google Drive, ensuring the original data remains intact.


# How to customize this workflow to your needs
- Adjust PII Identification: Modify the prompt in the OpenAI node to align with your specific data compliance requirements.
- Include/Exclude File Types: Adjust the Google Drive Trigger settings to monitor specific file types (e.g., CSV only).
- Output Destination: Change the folder in Google Drive where the sanitized file is uploaded.
