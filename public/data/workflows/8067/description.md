🌸 **The Quiet Evening Ritual — Wind-Down Automation (Telegram + Notion + Email)**

Create a calming **9PM evening** routine that runs itself. This n8n template checks in via Telegram with mood buttons, **delivers personalized support** (meditation when you’re tired, celebration when you’re thriving), logs reflections to a Notion “Evening Reflection Log,” and **sends a gentle goodnight email** with tomorrow’s affirmation.

**Who it’s for**

Homemakers, moms, and creators who feel “always on” and want a graceful, one-tap transition into rest.

**What it does**

**9:00 PM Telegram** mood check (I’m Tired 💤 / Felt Great ✨)

Personalized content (**5-min meditation or celebration prompt**)

Automatic Notion journaling (mood, reflection, wins, date, affirmation)

Goodnight email with a fresh morning affirmation

**Optional: GPT-4o mini for gentle reflection prompts**
