  "description": "Automate syncing of offline donor data from Google Sheets into SinergiaCRM for fast, error-free face-to-face fundraising tracking.\n\n### Who is this workflow for?\nThis workflow is perfect for nonprofit organizations that run face-to-face fundraising campaigns and collect donor data offline (e.g. via tablets or spreadsheets). It helps fundraising and CRM teams ensure donor records are correctly and automatically stored in **SinergiaCRM**, a popular CRM platform used by NGOs.\n\n### What it does / How it works\n- Watches a Google Sheet for new rows (also works offline if synced later).\n- Filters rows marked `To CRM = Yes` and `Processed = No`.\n- Checks if the donor already exists in **SinergiaCRM** (based on NIF).\n- If the contact exists: creates a “member” relationship and a payment commitment.\n- If not: creates the contact first, then adds the relationship and commitment.\n- Finally, updates the original row as “Processed” to prevent re-importing.\n\n### Requirements\n- An active **Google Sheets** account with the donor spreadsheet.\n- A **SinergiaCRM** account with API/OAuth access.\n- Fields `First name`, `Last name`, `Email`, `NIF`, `To CRM`, `Processed` must exist in the sheet.\n- SinergiaCRM modules enabled: Contacts, stic_Contacts_Relationships, stic_Payment_Commitments.\n\n### How to set up\n1. Connect your **Google Sheets** account and set the correct Document ID and Sheet name in the trigger and update nodes.  \n2. Connect your **SinergiaCRM** account using OAuth credentials.  \n3. Adjust the `assigned_user_id` field if required by your CRM instance.  \n\n### How to customize the workflow\n- Change the filter conditions in the IF nodes to match your business logic.\n- Customize fields like relationship type, amount, and periodicity to suit your campaign.\n- Add or remove nodes if you want additional steps (like sending Slack notifications).\n\n📌 Category: **CRM & Customer Management**  \n📘 [Learn more about SinergiaCRM](https://sinergiacrm.org)\n",
