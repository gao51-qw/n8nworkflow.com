Job Search Automation Workflow
Streamline Job Discovery with API-Powered Intelligence
This workflow template transforms the job search process by leveraging the Adzuna API and AI to automatically find, summarize, and evaluate job opportunities. Unlike traditional RSS-based job search tools, this workflow connects directly to Adzuna's comprehensive job API for real-time, high-quality job data.
Workflow Overview
The Job Search Automation Workflow follows a streamlined process:

    Define job titles to search for
    Fetch current job listings from Adzuna's API
    Split individual job results for processing
    Use AI to extract and summarize key job information
    Score each job against candidate profiles
    Organize results for easy review

This automation eliminates manual searching across job boards and provides objective evaluation of opportunities, saving valuable time for both job seekers and professionals who support them.
Technical Implementation
The workflow is built with a focus on efficiency and extensibility:

    API Integration: Direct connection to Adzuna's job API ensures access to current listings with comprehensive details
    AI Processing: Leverages OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently summarize job descriptions and evaluate candidate fit
    Modular Design: Each node serves a specific purpose, making the workflow easy to understand and customize
    Scalable Architecture: Can be expanded to include additional job sources or evaluation criteria
