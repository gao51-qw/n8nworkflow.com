### Hi, I’m Amanda 🌷
This workflow was built with love to help you manage your **Supabase database using natural language**, powered by the MCP (Multi-Channel Protocol) AI Agent on n8n.

With just a message like “update the status to active where city is New York”, your agent will know exactly what to do — safely, step by step, and always asking for confirmation before deleting anything.

It’s ideal for developers who want a smart assistant to create, update, delete or search database records without writing SQL or opening Supabase.

## What this workflow does

- Receives messages through a chat interface or webhook  
- Translates them into actions using GPT-4o (via LangChain Agent)  
- Interacts with Supabase using a custom MCP tool  
- Supports create, update, delete, search (single or all rows)  
- Handles confirmations, validations, and missing data checks

## Setup (quick and easy 💫)

1. Connect your Supabase credentials  
2. Adjust your table and field names  
3. Link the MCP webhook to your AI frontend (Typebot, WhatsApp, etc.)  
4. Customize the system message to reflect your tone of voice  
5. Start chatting — your agent is ready to assist!
