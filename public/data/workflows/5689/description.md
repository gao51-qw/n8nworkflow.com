This MCP server contains **32 operations** which is significantly more than the recommended maximum of tools for most AI clients.

### 🔍 Recommended Alternative for basic use cases
**Seek a simplified MCP server** that utilizes the official n8n tool implementation for Medium if available, or an MCP server with only common operations as it will be more efficient and easier to manage.

### 🛠️ Advanced Usage Requirements

**BEFORE adding this MCP server to your client:**
### Disable or delete unused nodes - Review sections and disable/delete those you don't need

**AFTER adding the MCP server to your client:**
1.**Selective tool enabling** - Instead of enabling all tools (default), manually select only the specific tools you need for *that* Workflow's MCP client.
2. **Monitor performance** - Too many tools can slow down AI responses

### 💡 Pro Tips
**Keep maximum 40 enabled tools** - Most AI clients perform better with fewer tools
- Group related operations and only enable one group at a time
- Use the overview note to understand what each operation group does

## ⚡ Quick Setup

1. **Import** this workflow into your n8n instance
2. **Credentials** Add Medium API credentials
3. **Activate** the workflow to start your MCP server
4. **Copy** the webhook URL from the MCP trigger node
5. **Connect** AI agents using the MCP URL

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow converts the Medium API into an MCP-compatible interface for AI agents.

• **MCP Trigger**: Serves as your server endpoint for AI agent requests
• **HTTP Request Nodes**: Handle API calls to https://medium2.p.rapidapi.com
• **AI Expressions**: Automatically populate parameters via `$fromAI()` placeholders
• **Native Integration**: Returns responses directly to the AI agent
