A smart personal assistant that can reason, search, calculate, and remember — powered by Google Gemini and ready in one click.

Most AI agents only respond — this one thinks before replying, pulls in real-time facts, does the math, and even remembers the last 5 things you said.

🔧 How it works
This template builds a conversational agent using the Google Gemini API. It uses multiple tools like:

🧠 Think – to reason step-by-step
🔍 SerpAPI – to search live data on Google
➗ Calculator – to solve math problems
💾 Memory – to remember short-term chat history

You can embed this agent into a chatbot, web app, or automate any customer support, research, or productivity workflow.

🧠 Your agent will:
- Understand what you're asking
- Think logically using the Think tool
- Search facts in real-time using SerpAPI
- Calculate numbers using a math engine
- Recall past context using a memory buffer
- And respond clearly — just like a real assistant.

🧑‍💼 Who is this template for?
This template is ideal for:
- Creators & developers building AI agents
- Teams needing a Gemini-powered assistant
