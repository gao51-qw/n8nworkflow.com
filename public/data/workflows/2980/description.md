# Nightly Discord Channel Cleanup
### This workflow runs every day at 9:00 p.m. and:
- Retrieves all Discord channels using your provided credentials.
- Pauses briefly to respect Discord API rate limits.
- Loops through each channel and fetches messages.
- Filters out messages older than seven days.
- Deletes those older messages, again pausing to stay within deletion rate limits.

By setting up this workflow on a schedule, you can automatically keep Discord channels tidy and compliant with retention policies.
