# 🌍 Auto-Translate Incoming Emails to English

This workflow automatically detects the language of every **new Gmail email** and translates non-English messages into English. The translated email is forwarded to your inbox with a clear "[TRANSLATED]" subject tag, and a label is added for easy filtering.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Gmail New Email Trigger**  
   - Listens for **new unread emails** in your Gmail inbox.  
   - Captures subject, sender, body text, and metadata.  

2. **Normalize Email Data**  
   - A **Code node** extracts the raw content from the email.  
   - Strips HTML, normalizes plain text, and prepares data for language detection.  

3. **Detect Language (OpenAI)**  
   - Uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** to detect the email’s language.  
   - If the language is English, workflow ends.  
   - If not, continues to translation.  

4. **Translate to English**  
   - OpenAI translates the email body into clear English.  

5. **Prepare Translated Email**  
   - Builds a forwarded email containing:  
     - Original sender & subject  
     - Received date  
     - Message ID  
     - Translated content (with formatting)  

6. **Send Translated Email**  
   - A **Gmail node** sends the translated message to your inbox.  
   - Subject is prefixed with `[TRANSLATED]` for easy recognition.  

7. **Add "Translated Emails" Label**  
   - Automatically tags the original message in Gmail with **"Translated Emails"**.  
   - Helps you filter all auto-translated emails later.
