# Automated form response system with Google Sheets, Slack, Gmail & Contacts

> ## What it does

Automatically respond to Google Form entries submitted via Google Sheets. This workflow notifies your Slack team, sends a personalized Gmail response to the user, and adds the user to Google Contacts — all triggered instantly upon new row addition in your connected Sheet.

## Who's it for

Perfect for lead capture forms, client inquiries, or feedback submissions.
Trigger: When a new row is added to a connected Google Sheet (usually linked to a Google Form).

Slack Notification: Sends a Slack message to your selected channel with the form data.

Gmail Message: Sends an automatic email reply to the submitter (using their email from the form).

Add Google Contact: Automatically creates a new contact in Google Contacts using the form data.

This setup is ideal for automating client communication and internal team alerts without manual input.
