# Enterprise Knowledge Search with GPT-4 Turbo, Google Drive & Academic APIs

This workflow provides an enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that intelligently searches multiple sources and generates AI-powered responses using GPT-4 Turbo.

## How it works

This workflow provides an enterprise-grade RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that intelligently searches multiple sources and generates AI-powered responses using GPT-4 Turbo.

## Key Steps

1. **Form Input** - Collects user queries with customizable search scope, response style, and language preferences
2. **Intelligent Search** - Routes queries to appropriate sources (web, academic papers, news, internal documents)
3. **Data Aggregation** - Unifies and processes information from multiple sources with quality scoring
4. **AI Processing** - Uses GPT-4 Turbo to generate context-aware, source-grounded responses
5. **Response Enhancement** - Formats outputs in various styles (comprehensive, concise, technical, etc.)
6. **Multi-Channel Delivery** - Delivers results via webhook, email, Slack, and optional PDF generation

## Data Sources & AI Models

### Search Sources
- **Web Search**: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo integration
- **Academic Papers**: arXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar via Crossref API
- **News Articles**: News API, RSS feeds, real-time news
- **Technical Documentation**: GitHub, Stack Overflow, documentation sites
- **Internal Knowledge**: Google Drive, Confluence, Notion integration

### AI Models
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Primary language model for response generation
- **Embedding Models**: For semantic search and similarity matching
- **Custom Prompts**: Specialized prompts for different response styles

## Set up steps

**Setup time: 15-20 minutes**

1. **Configure API credentials** - Set up OpenAI API, News API, Google Drive, and other service credentials
2. **Set up search sources** - Configure academic databases, news APIs, and internal knowledge sources
3. **Connect analytics** - Link Google Sheets for usage tracking and performance monitoring
4. **Configure notifications** - Set up Slack channels and email templates for automated alerts
5. **Test the workflow** - Run sample queries to verify all components are working correctly

**Keep detailed configuration notes in sticky notes inside your workflow**
