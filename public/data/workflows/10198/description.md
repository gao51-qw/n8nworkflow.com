## 🌟 Test Your n8n Discord Connection!
Trying to connect n8n to your Discord server but not sure where to start? 🤔 Setting up a Discord Bot and its credentials can be confusing. This workflow provides the perfect starting point, guiding you through the connection and running a test to fetch all channels from your server, confirming everything works!

---

## 🎯 What This Does
This workflow is a "getting started" template designed to solve one primary problem: creating and verifying your first Discord connection in n8n.

Its main benefit is demystifying the Discord Bot setup process. It proves your connection is successful by connecting to your server and fetching a complete list of all channels and categories. It's the perfect first step for any n8n user, community manager, or developer who wants to build Discord automations but needs a clear, working starting point.

## 🔄 How It Works
Manual Trigger: You start the workflow by clicking 'Execute workflow'.

**Set Server ID:** A 'Set' node is pre-configured to hold your specific Discord Server ID.

**Get Channels List:** The Discord node uses your credentials and the Server ID to connect to Discord and retrieve a list of all channels and categories on that server.

**Separate Channels & Categories:** An 'IF' node automatically sorts the list, sending channels down one path and categories down another.

**Process & Merge:** Two 'Set' nodes clean up the data from each path, and a 'Merge' node combines them back into one organized list.

**Next Step!:** The workflow finishes at a 'NoOp' node. You can click the 'Merge' node to see the final output a full list of your server's channels.

## Nodes Used
- When clicking ‘Execute workflow’ (Manual Trigger)
- Set - Server ID (Set)
