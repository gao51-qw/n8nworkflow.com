  "description": "## AI Meeting Assistant: Sync Fireflies Transcripts to ClickUp & Gmail\n\nAct as your personal executive assistant with this high-level automation designed to handle the most tedious post-meeting tasks. This workflow ensures that no action item is forgotten and that participants receive professional follow-ups without you having to lift a finger.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- Busy executives and managers who have back-to-back meetings.\n- Project managers who need to sync action items directly into ClickUp.\n- Sales teams who want to automate professional follow-up emails based on meeting context.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Fetch Transcripts:** The workflow runs on a schedule and retrieves your latest meeting data directly from the Fireflies.ai API using HTTP nodes.\n2. **Intelligent Filtering:** A JavaScript node filters the list to process only today's meetings.\n3. **AI Task Extraction:** An AI Agent (using GPT-4o-mini) analyzes the transcript to find tasks specifically assigned to the host. It then uses the ClickUp tool to create these tasks with priorities and descriptions.\n4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** To ensure quality, the workflow sends a summary to your Telegram. It asks for approval before sending any external emails.\n5. **Automated Follow-up:** Once approved, a second AI Agent drafts a concise, professional email summary and sends it via Gmail to the external participants.\n\n## Requirements\n- **Fireflies.ai Account:** You need an API Key (Settings -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Fireflies API).\n- **OpenAI API Key:** To power the AI Agents.\n- **ClickUp Workspace:** To manage the generated tasks.\n- **Telegram Bot:** For the approval notifications.\n- **Gmail Account:** For sending the follow-up emails.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Fireflies API Key:** Create a **Header Auth** credential in n8n. Set the Name to `Authorization` and the Value to `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`.\n2. **Configure Credentials:** Add your credentials for OpenAI, ClickUp, Telegram, and Gmail.\n3. **ClickUp Configuration:** In the \"Create ClickUp Task\" node, select your specific Workspace, Space, and List from the dropdown menus.\n4. **Identity Setup:** Open the \"Format Transcript Data\" code node. Update the `hostNames` array with your name and aliases (e.g., `['Host', 'My Name']`) so the AI correctly identifies you.\n5. **Telegram Chat ID:** Enter your Chat ID in the Telegram nodes to receive the approval prompts.",
