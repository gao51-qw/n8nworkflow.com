    "description": "#  AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Generator Workflow\n\n##  Overview\nThis workflow is a **two-part intelligent content creation system** built in **n8n**, designed to generate professional and on-brand **LinkedIn posts**.\n\nIt combines a conversational **frontend agent** that interacts naturally with users and a **backend post generation engine** powered by structured templates and **Mistral Cloud AI models**.\n\n---\n\n##  Workflow Structure\n- **Frontend:** Conversational “LinkedIn Agent” that guides the user.\n- **Backend:** “Post Generator” engine that produces final, high-quality content using dynamic templates.\n\n---\n\n##  LinkedIn Agent (Frontend Flow)\n\n- **Trigger:** `When chat message received`\n  Starts the workflow whenever a user sends a message to the chatbot or embedded interface.\n\n- **Agent:** `LinkedIn Agent`\n  - Welcomes the user and lists **7 available post templates**:\n    1. Educational  \n    2. Promotional  \n    3. Discussion  \n    4. Case Study & Testimonial  \n    5. News  \n    6. Personal  \n    7. General  \n  - Prompts the user to select a **template number**.\n  - Asks for a **topic** after the user’s choice.\n  - Sends both `template number` and `topic` to the backend using a **Tool** call.\n\n- **Memory:** `Simple Memory1`  \n  Stores the last 10 messages to maintain conversational context.\n\n- **LLM Model:** `Mistral Cloud Chat Model1`  \n  Used for reasoning, conversational responses, and user guidance.\n\n- **Tool Used:** `template`  \n  Invokes another trigger in the same workflow: `When Executed by Another Workflow`.\n  Passes the user’s chosen template and topic to the backend.\n\n---\n\n##  Post Generation Engine (Backend Flow)\n\n- **Trigger:** `When Executed by Another Workflow`  \n  Receives payload from the `template` tool (template ID + topic).\n\n- **Router Node:** `Switch between templates`  \n  - Directs flow to the correct post template logic based on user’s choice (1–7).  \n  - Example:  \n    - `1 → Knowledge & Educational`  \n    - `2 → Promotion`  \n    - `3 → Discussion`  \n    - `4 → Case Study & Testimonial`  \n    - etc.\n\n- **Prompt Template Nodes:**  \n  Each `Set` node defines a **large, structured prompt** containing:\n  - Specific tone, audience, and purpose rules  \n  - Example hooks and CTAs  \n  - Layout and line formatting instructions  \n  - “FORBIDDEN PHRASES” list (e.g., no “game-changer”, “revolutionary”)\n\n- **Expert Writer Agent:** `post generator`  \n  - A specialized agent node that receives the selected prompt template.  \n  - Generates the final LinkedIn post text using strict formatting and tone rules.  \n  - **Model:** `Mistral Cloud Chat Model`\n\n- **Output:**  \n  The generated post text is sent back to the `template` tool and displayed to the user in chat.\n\n---\n\n##  Integrations Used\n| Service | Purpose | Credential |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| **Mistral Cloud** | LLM & post generation | `Mistral Cloud account dbt` |\n| **n8n Agent Framework** | Multi-agent orchestration | Native |\n| **Chat UI / Webhook** | Frontend interaction | `Custom embedded UI or webhook trigger` |\n\n---\n\n##  Agent System Prompt Summary\n&gt; “You are an intelligent LinkedIn assistant that helps users craft posts.  \nList available templates, guide them to select one, and collect a topic.  \nThen use the provided `template` tool to request the backend writer to generate a final post.”\n\nBackend writer’s system prompt:  \n&gt; “You are an expert LinkedIn marketing leader.  \nGenerate structured, professional posts for AI/automation topics.  \nAvoid hype, buzzwords, and clichés.  \nKeep sentences short, tone confident, and use strong openers.”\n\n---\n\n##  Key Features\n-  Dual-agent architecture (Frontend Assistant + Backend Writer)  \n-  7 dynamic content templates for flexibility  \n- Conversational chat interface for ease of use  \n-  Strict brand tone enforcement with style run Fully automated generation and return of final post in chat\n\n---\n\n##  Summary\n&gt; A modular, agent-based n8n workflow for **automated LinkedIn post creation**, featuring conversational input, structured templates, and AI-generated output powered by **Mistral Cloud**.\n\nPerfect for content teams, social media managers, and AI automation startups.\n\n---\n\n###  **Need Help or More Workflows?**\nWant to customize this workflow for your business.\nOur team at **Digital Biz Tech** can tailor it precisely to your use case — from automation logic to AI-powered content engines.\n\nWe can help you set it up for free — from connecting credentials to deploying it live.\n\nContact: [shilpa.raju@digitalbiz.tech](mailto:shilpa.raju@digitalbiz.tech)  \nWebsite: [https://www.digitalbiz.tech](https://www.digitalbiz.tech)  \nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-biz-tech/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-biz-tech/)  \nYou can also DM us on LinkedIn for any help.\n\n---\n",

Welcome to the vibe coding revolution \\n Why Vibe Coding is Taking Over Software Development in 2025\\n Remember when coding meant wrestling with syntax errors at 2 AM? Those days are rapidly becoming history.\\n What is Vibe Coding?\\nCoined by AI visionary Andrej Karpathy earlier this year, vibe coding represents a fundamental shift in how we build software. Instead of writing code line by line, developers now describe what they want in plain English, and AI transforms those intentions into working applications.\\n Think of it as having a conversation with your computer:\\n Build me a social media dashboard that tracks engagement metrics\\\" → and the code just appears.\\n Why It's Exploding Right Now:\\n🔹 Accessibility Revolution: Non-technical professionals can now build functional software, democratizing development like never before\\n🔹 Efficiency Multiplier: Y Combinator's Garry Tan notes that vibe coding allows 10 engineers to do the work of 100, transforming startup economics\\n🔹 Perfect Timing: AI tools like Cursor, Replit Agent, and Windsurf have matured beyond simple autocomplete to full end-to-end development\\n🔹 Market Adoption: 44% of developers have already adopted AI coding tools, with adoption accelerating monthly\\n The Real Impact:\\nStartups are shrinking development teams from 50+ engineers to 5-10 core architects. Students and kids are building complex applications that previously required computer science degrees. The barrier between having an idea and making it real has never been lower.\\n Is This Just Hype?\\nWhile skeptics question sustainability, the numbers don't lie. This isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying human creativity and removing technical friction from innovation.\\n The future of software isn't about who can write the most elegant loops. It's about who can best articulate problems and solutions.\\n What do you think? Are you experimenting with vibe coding in your projects?\\n #VibeCoding #AI #SoftwareDevelopment #Innovation #TechTrends #Automation #StartupLife\"\n\n}\n",

Start a chat or trigger it from another workflow with a topic + summary.  \n2. The LinkedIn Agent asks what kind of post you want (Educational, Discussion, Promotion, etc.).  \n3. A Switch node selects the right prompt template.  \n4. The Post Generator agent runs quality checks and calls Mistral to produce the final post text.  \n5. The post is returned for review or publication.\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Add your **Mistral Cloud credentials** in the credentials manager.  \n2. Optionally connect another workflow to pass in “topic” and “template” values.  \n3. Run the chat trigger or execute manually to test.  \n4. Review the generated post in the output.\n\n💡 Tip: Templates are customizable — open each “Set” node to edit tone, structure, or examples.\n"
