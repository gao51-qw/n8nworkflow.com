## Who Is This Template For?
This template is ideal for:

- Professionals: Who want to save important messages, extract data from namecards, or organize images automatically.
- Teams: Looking to integrate LINE messages into tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft To Do for better collaboration.
- Developers: Seeking to build intelligent workflows that process text, images, and other inputs from LINE.
- Business Owners: Who need to manage customer interactions, follow-ups, and task tracking efficiently.

## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?
Managing incoming messages on LINE can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with diverse input types like text, images, and namecards. This workflow solves that problem by:
- Automatically identifying and routing different message types (text, images, namecards) to appropriate actions.
- Extracting structured data from namecards and saving it for follow-up tasks.
- Uploading images to OneDrive and saving text messages to Microsoft Teams or Microsoft To Do for easy access.
- Sending real-time feedback to users via LINE to confirm that their messages have been processed.

## What This Workflow Does
- Receive Messages via LINE Webhook:
The workflow is triggered whenever a user sends a message (text, image, or other types) to the LINE bot.
- Display Loading Animation:
A loading animation is displayed to reassure the user that their request is being processed.
Route Input Types:

The workflow uses a Switch node to determine the type of input:
- Text Starting with "T": Adds the message as a task in Microsoft To Do.
- Plain Text: Saves the message in Microsoft Teams under a designated channel (e.g., "Notes").
- Images: Identifies whether the image is a namecard, handwritten note, or other content, then processes accordingly.
- Unsupported formats trigger a polite response indicating the limitation.
Process Namecards:

**Images **
If the image is identified as a namecard, the workflow extracts structured data (e.g., name, email, phone number) using OpenRouter.ai and saves it to Microsoft To Do for follow-up tasks.
Save Images to OneDrive:

Images are uploaded to OneDrive, renamed based on their unique message ID, and linked in Microsoft Teams for reference.

**Send Feedback via LINE:**
The workflow replies to the user with confirmation messages, such as "[ Task Created ]" or "[ Message Saved ]."
