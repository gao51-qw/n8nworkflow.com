This template shows how you can take any event from any service, transform its data and send an alert to your desired app. 

Specifically, this example monitors a **Linear project** for new bug submissions. Then it only sends a **Slack notification** to a channel if a new bug is urgent. You can swap the Linear trigger for another Task Management app such as Jira or Asana; or an entirely different usecase.

Setup instructions are located inside the workflow template.
