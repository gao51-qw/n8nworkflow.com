  "description": "This workflow integrates **Flowise Multi-Agent Chatflows** into a **custom-branded n8n chatbot**, enabling real-time interaction between users and AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages:\n\n#### ✅ Easy Integration with Flowise:\n\n* Uses a **low-code HTTP node** to send user questions to Flowise's API (`/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID`) and receive intelligent responses.\n* Supports **multi-agent chatflows**, allowing for complex, dynamic interactions.\n\n#### 🎨 Customizable Chatbot UI:\n\n* Includes pre-built JavaScript for embedding the n8n chatbot into any website.\n* Provides customization options such as welcome messages, branding, placeholder text, chat modes (e.g., popup or embedded), and language support.\n\n#### 🔐 Secure & Configurable:\n\n* Authorization via **Bearer token** headers for Flowise API access.\n* Clearly marked notes in the workflow for setting environment variables like `FLOWISE_URL` and `FLOW_ID`.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works  \n1. **Chat Trigger**: The workflow starts with the `When chat message received` node, which acts as a webhook to receive incoming chat messages from users.  \n2. **HTTP Request to Flowise**: The received message is forwarded to the `Flowise` node, which sends a POST request to a Flowise API endpoint (`https://FLOWISEURL/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID`). The request includes the user's input as a JSON payload (`{\"question\": \"{{ $json.chatInput }}\"}`) and uses HTTP header authentication (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer FLOWSIE_API`).  \n3. **Response Handling**: The response from Flowise is passed to the `Edit Fields` node, which maps the output (`$json.text`) for further processing or display.  \n\n### Set Up Steps  \n1. **Configure Flowise Integration**:  \n   - Replace `FLOWISEURL` and `FLOWISE_ID` in the HTTP Request node with your Flowise instance URL and flow ID.  \n   - Ensure the `Authorization` header is set correctly in the credentials (e.g., `Bearer FLOWSIE_API`).  \n\n2. **Embed n8n Chatbot**:  \n   - Use the provided JavaScript snippet in the sticky notes to embed the n8n chatbot on your website. Replace `YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL generated by the `When chat message received` node.  \n   - Customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior (e.g., welcome messages, language, UI elements) using the `createChat` configuration options.  \n\n3. **Optional Branding**:  \n   - Adjust the sticky note examples to include branding details, such as custom messages, colors, or metadata for the chatbot.  \n\n4. **Activate Workflow**:  \n   - Toggle the workflow to \"Active\" in n8n and test the chat functionality end-to-end.  \n\n---\n\n###  Ideal Use Cases:\n\n* Embedding branded AI assistants into websites.\n* Connecting Flowise-powered agents with customer support chatbots.\n* Creating dynamic, smart conversational flows with LLMs via n8n automation.\n\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
