This workflow integrates **Flowise Multi-Agent Chatflows** into a **custom-branded n8n chatbot**, enabling real-time interaction between users and AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

---

### Key Advantages:

#### ✅ Easy Integration with Flowise:

* Uses a **low-code HTTP node** to send user questions to Flowise's API (`/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID`) and receive intelligent responses.
* Supports **multi-agent chatflows**, allowing for complex, dynamic interactions.

#### 🎨 Customizable Chatbot UI:

* Includes pre-built JavaScript for embedding the n8n chatbot into any website.
* Provides customization options such as welcome messages, branding, placeholder text, chat modes (e.g., popup or embedded), and language support.

#### 🔐 Secure & Configurable:

* Authorization via **Bearer token** headers for Flowise API access.
* Clearly marked notes in the workflow for setting environment variables like `FLOWISE_URL` and `FLOW_ID`.

### How It Works  
1. **Chat Trigger**: The workflow starts with the `When chat message received` node, which acts as a webhook to receive incoming chat messages from users.  
2. **HTTP Request to Flowise**: The received message is forwarded to the `Flowise` node, which sends a POST request to a Flowise API endpoint (`https://FLOWISEURL/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID`). The request includes the user's input as a JSON payload (`{"question": "{{ $json.chatInput }}"}`) and uses HTTP header authentication (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer FLOWSIE_API`).  
3. **Response Handling**: The response from Flowise is passed to the `Edit Fields` node, which maps the output (`$json.text`) for further processing or display.  

### Set Up Steps  
1. **Configure Flowise Integration**:  
   - Replace `FLOWISEURL` and `FLOWISE_ID` in the HTTP Request node with your Flowise instance URL and flow ID.  
   - Ensure the `Authorization` header is set correctly in the credentials (e.g., `Bearer FLOWSIE_API`).  

2. **Embed n8n Chatbot**:  
   - Use the provided JavaScript snippet in the sticky notes to embed the n8n chatbot on your website. Replace `YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL generated by the `When chat message received` node.  
   - Customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior (e.g., welcome messages, language, UI elements) using the `createChat` configuration options.  

3. **Optional Branding**:  
   - Adjust the sticky note examples to include branding details, such as custom messages, colors, or metadata for the chatbot.  

4. **Activate Workflow**:  
   - Toggle the workflow to "Active" in n8n and test the chat functionality end-to-end.
