# AI-Powered Lead Qualification using Zoho CRM, People Data Labs, and Google Gemini

This workflow automatically checks Zoho CRM every 5 minutes for newly created leads, enriches each lead using People Data Labs, evaluates its quality using Google Gemini (LLM Chain) and updates the lead status in Zoho CRM as Qualified or Not Qualified. Qualified leads trigger an automated Gmail notification to the sales team.

### Quick Start Setup

1. Add Zoho CRM OAuth credentials. 
2. Add your People Data Labs API key. 
3. Add your Google Gemini (PaLM) LLM API credentials. 
4. Add Gmail OAuth credentials and set your recipient email. 
5. Activate the workflow. 
6. Create a test lead and verify enrichment → scoring → update → email.

## What It Does

This workflow serves as an automated AI-driven lead qualification engine. Every 5 minutes, it fetches leads from Zoho CRM, filters newly created ones, enriches them using People Data Labs and scores them via Google Gemini.
