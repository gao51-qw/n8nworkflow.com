  "description": "## Who’s it for\nTeams that manage tasks in ClickUp and want those tasks reflected—and kept in sync—in Google Calendar automatically.\n\n## How it works\nA ClickUp Trigger captures task events (create, update, delete). For new tasks, the workflow creates a Google Calendar event with the correct start/end. It stores a mapping between `clickupTaskId` and `calendarEventId` in a Google Sheet so later updates and deletions can target the right event. Multiple lanes (personal/school/tech/internship) let you route tasks to different calendars.\n\n## How to set up\n1. Assign **ClickUp OAuth**, **Google Calendar**, and **Google Sheets** credentials to the nodes.\n2. Open the **Configuration** node and fill:\n   - `calendarId_*` for each lane\n   - `sheetId` and `sheetTabName` for the mapping sheet\n   - (optional) `clickupTeamId`\n3. Enable the **ClickUp Trigger** and run a manual test to validate mapping creation and event syncing.\n\n## Requirements\n- ClickUp workspace with OAuth permissions\n- Google Calendar & Sheets access\n- A Google Sheet for the event↔task mapping\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- Edit the calendar routing in **Edit Fields** nodes or point them to different `calendarId_*` values.\n- Adjust event colors/fields in Google Calendar nodes.\n- Extend the mapping sheet with extra columns (e.g., status, labels) as needed.\n",
