![leadoutreach](https://i.ibb.co/KpWWKSWq/Chat-GPT-Image-Oct-25-2025-02-57-54-PM.png)



## Who is this for?

This workflow is designed for **sales/RevOps teams, B2B founders, SDR/AE teams, and agencies** who live in HubSpot and need consistent, compliant first-touch outreach at scale. If you regularly build reusable, multi-client n8n automations, this template will save you hours of manual work.

## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case

Manual lead handling is **slow and inconsistent**:

- Leads arrive messy across forms, lists, and imports; ownership and priority are unclear.
- Finding the right decision-maker and a deliverable email takes too long.
- Outreach copy drifts from brand guidelines, and CRM updates get missed.

This workflow solves the problem by **creating a reliable pipeline** from capture → enrichment → verification → CRM sync → Outlook draft, cutting handoffs and preserving auditability.

## What this workflow does

1. **Capture and batching** - Triggers on new/updated leads in HubSpot or pulls "ready" rows from Google Sheets; processes items sequentially to stay rate-safe.

2. **Normalize and score (ICP)** - Cleans names, company, and domains; applies configurable ICP rules and writes score plus reasoning back to HubSpot/Sheets.

3. **Enrich contacts** - Confirms official company details and identifies likely decision-makers via focused people searches; dedupes and role-normalizes.

4. **Verify emails** - Finds work emails, checks deliverability, and logs confidence and timestamps to a tracking sheet immediately after each result.

5. **Compose outreach** - Calls the approved template in `Email content`; personalizes only the first name; validates structure via `Structured Output Parser`.

6. **Draft in Outlook** - Uses Microsoft Graph to create an HTML draft; embeds an inline signature image fetched from Google Drive.

7. **CRM sync and tasks** - Creates/updates HubSpot contacts and associations, stores the composed email in properties, and opens a next-day follow-up task for the owner.

8. **Safety and observability** - Deterministic prompts, strict parsing, idempotent writes, and clear flags prevent duplicates; optional Slack/Teams alerts for failures.

## Setup

1. **Connect your accounts**:
   - HubSpot (app token)
   - Microsoft Graph (OAuth2)
   - Google Sheets
   - Google Drive
   - Your LLM provider (for `Level 2 Orchestrator` and `Email content`)

2. **Set your credentials** in the respective nodes.

3. **Adjust the Google Sheet IDs** to match your own sheet structure.

4. **Map HubSpot properties** (owner, contact/company IDs, custom fields for score, reasoning, and email content).

5. **Paste your approved HTML** in `Email content` and upload your signature image to Drive.

6. **Configure schedule**, batch size, and any Slack/Teams webhooks for notifications.

## How to customize this workflow to your needs

- **ICP logic**: Edit scoring weights and required qualifiers (industry, region, size, tech stack).
- **Personas**: Change role detection and caps (e.g., Ops, Finance, Procurement).
- **Copy control**: Swap the template in `Email content` or add A/B variants while keeping structure validation.
- **Triggers**: Use webhook capture from forms, list-based pulls, or time-based recrawls.
- **Delivery**: Switch the mail node to Gmail API if preferred; keep the same compose/verify/track sequence.
- **Governance**: Add holdouts, opt-out checks, and rate limits per domain or owner; expand logs for export to a data warehouse.

✨ With this workflow, you go from **messy inbound leads → verified contacts → synchronized HubSpot records → ready-to-send Outlook drafts** in just minutes, with almost no manual work.
