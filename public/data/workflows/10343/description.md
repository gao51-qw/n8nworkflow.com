# | N8N Workflow | AI Reddit Problem Detection & Auto-Solution Commenter 🤖

*This n8n workflow automates Reddit community engagement by detecting posts that discuss problems and automatically replying with AI-generated solutions — powered by Google Gemini.*

*It’s designed for developers, automation creators, and brands who want to provide helpful, automated responses to Reddit users discussing issues in their niche.*

## How It Works

- The workflow starts with a Manual Trigger (When clicking ‘Execute workflow’).
- Search for a Post: It scans the r/n8n subreddit (or any subreddit you set) for recent posts containing the keyword “Why I stopped using”.
- Filter Posts (If Node): Filters posts that have 2 or more upvotes and non-empty text, ensuring only quality discussions are analyzed.
- Edit Fields: Extracts post details such as title, body text, upvotes, creation time, and subreddit ID for AI processing.

**AI Agent + Google Gemini Chat Model:**
 - The first AI node analyzes the post and decides whether it’s describing a problem or frustration related to AI automation.
 
 - Gemini responds with “Yes” or “No.”

**Conditional Branch (If1 Node):**
- If “Yes,” the post is confirmed as discussing a problem.
- The workflow then triggers the second AI Agent.

**AI Agent 2 + Gemini:**
- The second AI node uses Gemini to generate a helpful and concise solution addressing the issue mentioned in the Reddit post (for example, offering a fix, suggestion, or new idea).

**Merge & Log Data:**
- The AI’s findings (post details + solution) are merged and saved into a connected Google Sheet for tracking community insights.

**Comment on Reddit:**
- The workflow automatically posts the AI-generated solution as a comment reply on the original Reddit thread, engaging users directly.
