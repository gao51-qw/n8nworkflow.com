  "description": "# | N8N Workflow | AI Reddit Problem Detection & Auto-Solution Commenter 🤖\n\n*This n8n workflow automates Reddit community engagement by detecting posts that discuss problems and automatically replying with AI-generated solutions — powered by Google Gemini.*\n\n*It’s designed for developers, automation creators, and brands who want to provide helpful, automated responses to Reddit users discussing issues in their niche.*\n\n## How It Works\n\n- The workflow starts with a Manual Trigger (When clicking ‘Execute workflow’).\n- Search for a Post: It scans the r/n8n subreddit (or any subreddit you set) for recent posts containing the keyword “Why I stopped using”.\n- Filter Posts (If Node): Filters posts that have 2 or more upvotes and non-empty text, ensuring only quality discussions are analyzed.\n- Edit Fields: Extracts post details such as title, body text, upvotes, creation time, and subreddit ID for AI processing.\n\n**AI Agent + Google Gemini Chat Model:**\n - The first AI node analyzes the post and decides whether it’s describing a problem or frustration related to AI automation.\n \n - Gemini responds with “Yes” or “No.”\n\n**Conditional Branch (If1 Node):**\n- If “Yes,” the post is confirmed as discussing a problem.\n- The workflow then triggers the second AI Agent.\n\n**AI Agent 2 + Gemini:**\n- The second AI node uses Gemini to generate a helpful and concise solution addressing the issue mentioned in the Reddit post (for example, offering a fix, suggestion, or new idea).\n\n**Merge & Log Data:**\n- The AI’s findings (post details + solution) are merged and saved into a connected Google Sheet for tracking community insights.\n\n**Comment on Reddit:**\n- The workflow automatically posts the AI-generated solution as a comment reply on the original Reddit thread, engaging users directly.\n\n## How To Use\n- Import the provided JSON workflow into your n8n dashboard.\n\n- Set up the required credentials:\n\n - Reddit OAuth2 API – for searching and posting comments.\n\n - Google Gemini (PaLM) API – for AI text analysis and solution generation.\n\n- Google Sheets API – for logging post data and AI results.\n\n- Adjust the subreddit name, search keyword, or prompts to fit your niche.\n\n- Click Execute Workflow to run the automation.\n\n## Requirements\n- Reddit Developer Account (OAuth2 credentials).\n- Google Gemini (PaLM) API account for AI processing.\n- Google Sheets account for saving analysis results.\n\n## How To Customize\n- Change the search keyword (e.g., “help with automation,” “issue with API,” etc.).\n- Modify the AI prompts to tailor the solution style (technical, friendly, educational, etc.).\n- Edit the Google Sheet fields to capture more or fewer details.\n- Enable/disable the comment node if you want to manually approve replies before posting.\n- Adjust the Gemini model name (e.g., models/gemini-2.0-flash) or parameters for faster or more creative responses.\n",
