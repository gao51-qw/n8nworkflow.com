  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis is an advanced \"Agentic\" workflow that acts as an autonomous lead generation specialist. It goes beyond simple scraping by \"thinking\" about where to look for contact info.\n\n1. **Search & Filter:** It performs a Google Search for your niche (e.g., \"Marketing Agencies in Toronto\"), normalizing results to remove directories (Clutch, Yelp) and junk links.\n2. **Homepage Analysis:** It visits every lead's website and uses an AI Agent to identify key pages (Contact, About, Careers) and social profiles.\n3. **Deep Scan (Branch A):** If a \"Contact Us\" page is found, a second AI Agent visits that specific page to extract hidden emails and phone numbers.\n4. **LinkedIn Enrichment (Branch B):** Simultaneously, if a LinkedIn profile is found, it scrapes the profile to extract Company Size, Industry, and Headquarters location.\n5. **Aggregation:** Finally, it merges data from all sources, formats the arrays into readable text, and saves the complete profile to Google Sheets.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. **Configure APIs:**\n   * **Serper.dev:** Required for the initial Google Search results.\n   * **ScraperAPI:** Required to bypass bot detection when visiting company websites and LinkedIn.\n   * **Google Gemini (or OpenAI):** Required for the AI Agents to analyze HTML.\n\n2. **Setup Google Sheet:**\n   * Create a new Sheet with these exact headers in Row 1: `Company Name`, `Linked Summary`, `employee count`, `industry`, `Emails`, `Phone`, `Website`.\n   * Connect the **Google Sheets** node to this file.\n\n3. **Configure Variables:**\n   * In the **Edit Fields** node (Start), enter your `search_query` (e.g., \"Plumbers in Chicago\").\n\n4. **Important Note:**\n   * This workflow uses a **Loop** with a 1.5s wait time to be polite to servers. A batch of 50 leads will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.",
