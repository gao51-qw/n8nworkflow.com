  "description": "\n## Who is this for?\n\nThis template is designed for **Marketing Managers**, **Performance Marketers**, and **Ad Ops professionals** who want to automate Facebook ad creation using structured data in **Google Sheets**. It’s ideal for teams running multiple creatives or testing ad variations without having to manually use Meta Ads Manager.\n\n&gt; ⚠️ **Important Note:**  \nThis is **not a plug-and-play** workflow. It requires:\n- A configured **Facebook Business account**\n- A valid **Facebook App**, **Page**, and **Ad Account**\n- **Access tokens** and the correct Facebook Graph API credentials\n- A **basic understanding of the Meta API and JSON** to tweak ad set parameters like demographics, optimization goals, or sales objectives\n\nAdditionally, launching Facebook ads will incur **real advertising costs**, so this template is best suited for users willing to make a time investment to set things up properly and test responsibly. Expect to spend time customizing targeting and budget strategies based on your campaign needs.\n\n## What problem does this solve?\n\nManually uploading creatives, setting up ad sets, and creating ads in Meta’s Ad Manager is time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone—especially at scale. This workflow eliminates the manual work by pulling data from Google Sheets and using it to automatically:\n\n- Generate Facebook Ad Sets\n- Upload creative images\n- Build and launch Ad Creatives and Ads\n- Update your source spreadsheet with generated Ad IDs\n![Screenshot 20250406 at 10.25.58.png](fileId:1083)\n## What this workflow does\n\nUsing a trigger from a **Google Sheets row update**, this workflow:\n\n1. **Reads ad parameters** (like message, render URL, and campaign info) from a Google Sheet  \n2. **Generates ad set configuration** dynamically using variables in an “Edit Fields” node  \n3. **Creates a Facebook Ad Set** via the Graph API  \n4. **Fetches the ad image** from a render URL  \n5. **Uploads the image** to Facebook Ads Library  \n6. **Creates the Ad Creative** using the uploaded image and dynamic text  \n7. **Launches the Ad** using the generated Ad Set and Creative  \n8. **Updates the same Google Sheet** with the generated Ad ID and status\n\nAll configuration fields like `campaign_id`, `act_id`, `pixel_id`, age ranges, interest targeting, and call-to-action links are defined up front in a single **Edit Fields** node, making the template easy to maintain or extend.\n\n#### **Google Sheet Structure**\n| Hooks | Render URL | Generate Ad | Ad ID |\n|-------|------------|-------------|-------|\n| Static ad text (e.g., “Visit us at...”) | Link to the creative asset (image) | Status: `generate`, `generated`, or `error` | Populated by the workflow with the created Facebook Ad ID |\n\n- **Hooks**: This is the primary ad copy. It will be used as the main text for the static ad.\n- **Render URL**: Direct link to the media asset (image or video) for the ad.\n- **Generate Ad**: Dropdown or text value that controls workflow execution:\n  - `generate` — workflow will attempt to create the ad\n  - `generated` — already processed\n  - `error` — error occurred during generation\n- **Ad ID**: The Meta Ad ID will be written here once the ad is successfully created.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Copy this [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNRd87p7DL4G3j6F4xSD2jlLQc9wnqHnVfq1R42k9Uc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) and populate it with your data\n2. Create a Facebook App and retrieve the access credentials for the **Facebook Graph API**\n3. In n8n:\n   - Connect your Google Sheets and Facebook Graph API accounts\n   - Update the `Edit Fields` node with your actual `ad account ID`, `page ID`, `campaign ID`, `pixel ID`, and destination `link`\n   - Deploy the workflow\n\nThis workflow runs every time the `generate ad` column in your sheet is updated.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Modify the `Edit Fields` node to adjust ad set parameters like targeting, budget strategy, CTA type, and more\n- Expand interest-based targeting using more interest objects in the array\n- Add extra Google Sheet columns and map them to Facebook ad fields (e.g. different messages, URLs, creative assets)\n- Add logic to pause or duplicate ads based on performance",
