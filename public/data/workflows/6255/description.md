### How the sequence works:
1. A "Schedule Trigger" node activates the automation at a defined schedule.
2. An "[Airtable](https://airtable.com)" node will search for previously posted questions in your question database.
	1. Airtable Base Template: [here](https://airtable.com/app6wzQqegKIJOiOg/shrzy7L9yv8BFRQdY)
3. An "Aggregate" node will take all the questions from Airtable and compress them to a single output.
4. ChatGPT, or a model of your choice, will generate a discussion question based on the options in the system prompt.
5. The discussion question will be posted to the subreddit of your choice by the "Reddit" node.
	1. You can choose between a text, image, or link post!
6. The recently-posted discussion question will then be uploaded to your Airtable base using the "Airtable" node. This will be used to prevent ChatGPT from creating duplicate questions.
