This workflow allows you to complete the entire process of creating and publishing detailed Instagram Carousels—from research to posting—without ever leaving Slack. It leverages **Nano Banana Pro**, a state-of-the-art image generation model capable of rendering perfect text, to create professional "consultant-style" slides that AI previously struggled with.

## How it works
1.  **Start in Slack**: You trigger the workflow by entering a topic ensuring the entire process starts in Slack.
2.  **Research (AI Agent)**: An AI agent searches the web for deep insights on the topic.
3.  **Drafting (AI Agent)**: Structures research into a carousel format designed for engagement.
4.  **Review in Slack**: The draft is sent to Slack as a formatted message. You approve it with a single click.
5.  **Image Generation**: Upon approval, **Nano Banana Pro** generates professional infographic-style images with legible, high-density text.
6.  **Final Review in Slack**: The created images and caption are sent back to Slack.
7.  **Publish from Slack**: One final approval in Slack automatically publishes the Carousel to Instagram.

## Setup steps
1.  **Configure Credentials**:
    *   **OpenAI API**: Required for the Research and Drafting agents (GPT-4o/GPT-5 recommended).
