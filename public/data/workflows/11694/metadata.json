  "description": "This workflow allows you to complete the entire process of creating and publishing detailed Instagram Carousels—from research to posting—without ever leaving Slack. It leverages **Nano Banana Pro**, a state-of-the-art image generation model capable of rendering perfect text, to create professional \"consultant-style\" slides that AI previously struggled with.\n\n## How it works\n1.  **Start in Slack**: You trigger the workflow by entering a topic ensuring the entire process starts in Slack.\n2.  **Research (AI Agent)**: An AI agent searches the web for deep insights on the topic.\n3.  **Drafting (AI Agent)**: Structures research into a carousel format designed for engagement.\n4.  **Review in Slack**: The draft is sent to Slack as a formatted message. You approve it with a single click.\n5.  **Image Generation**: Upon approval, **Nano Banana Pro** generates professional infographic-style images with legible, high-density text.\n6.  **Final Review in Slack**: The created images and caption are sent back to Slack.\n7.  **Publish from Slack**: One final approval in Slack automatically publishes the Carousel to Instagram.\n\n## Setup steps\n1.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    *   **OpenAI API**: Required for the Research and Drafting agents (GPT-4o/GPT-5 recommended).\n    *   **Slack API**: Required for notifications and approval buttons.\n    *   **Kie.ai (Nano Banana Pro)**: Required for high-quality text-in-image generation.\n    *   **Facebook Graph API**: Required for publishing to Instagram.\n2.  **Set IDs**:\n    *   Open the \"Slack Approval\" nodes and set your `Channel ID`.\n    *   Open the \"Instagram\" nodes and set your `Instagram Business Account ID`.\n3.  **Customize Prompts (Optional)**: Adjust the system prompts in the AI nodes to match your brand's tone of voice.\n\n## Requirements\n*   **n8n version**: 1.0+ (AI nodes required)\n*   **Kie.ai Account**: For using the Nano Banana Pro model (excellent at rendering text).\n*   **Slack Workspace**: For the Human-in-the-loop approval process.\n",
