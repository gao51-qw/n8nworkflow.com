  "description": "# 🔧 Automated Video Generator (n8n Workflow)\n\n## 🚀 Features\n- End-to-End Video Creation from user idea or transcript\n\n- AI-Powered Scriptwriting using LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek via OpenRouter)\n\n- Voiceover Generation with customizable TTS voices\n\n- Image Scene Generation using generative models like together.ai\n\n- Clip Creation & Concatenation into a full video\n\n- Dynamic Caption Generation with styling options\n\n- Google Drive & Sheets Integration for asset storage and progress tracking\n\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\nUser Submits Form with:\n\n- Main topic or transcript\n- Desired duration\n- TTS voice\n- Visual style (e.g., Pixar, Lego, Cyberpunk)\n- Image generation provider\n\nAI generates a script: A catchy title, description, hook, full script, and CTA using a language model.\n\nText-to-Speech (TTS): The script is turned into audio using the selected voice, with timestamped captions generated.\n\nScene Segmentation: The script is split into 5–6 second segments for visual storyboarding.\n\nImage Prompt Creation: Each scene is converted into an image prompt in the selected style (e.g., \"anime close-up of a racing car\").\n\nImage Generation: Prompts are sent to together.ai or fal.ai to generate scenes.\n\nClip Creation: Each image is turned into a short video clip (Ken Burns-style zoom) based on script timing.\n\nVideo Assembly:\n\n- All clips are concatenated into a single video.\n- Captions are overlaid using the earlier timestamps.\n- Final Output is uploaded to Google Drive, Telegram and links are saved in Google Sheets.\n\n\n## 🛠 Inital Setup\n\n### 🗣️ 1. Set Up TTS Voice (Text-to-Speech)\n\nRun your TTS server locally using Docker.\n\n### 🧰 2. Set Up NCA-Toolkit\nThe nca-toolkit appears to be a custom video/image processing backend used via HTTP APIs:\n\nhttp://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/image/transform/video\n\nhttp://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/video/concatenate\n\nhttp://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/ffmpeg/compose\n\n#### 🔧 Steps:\nClone or build the nca-toolkit container (if it's a private tool):\n\nEnsure it exposes port 9090.\n\nIt should support endpoints for:\n\nImage to video (zoom effect)\n\nVideo concatenation\n\nAudio + video merging\n\nCaption overlay via FFmpeg\n\nRun it locally with Docker:\n\n*docker run -d -p 9090:80 your-nca-toolkit-image*\n\n### 🧠 3. Set Up together.ai (Image Generation) (Optional *You can use ChatGPT API Instead*)\n\nThis handles image generation using models like FLUX.1-schnell.\n\n🔧 Steps:\nCreate an account at: https://www.together.ai\n\nGenerate your API key\n\n",
