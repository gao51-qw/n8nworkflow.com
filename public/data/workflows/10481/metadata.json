This ain’t your grandma’s weather app. It’s a bulletproof system that scans your calendar, mines your trips, and delivers laser-targeted weather intel and urgent alerts, right when you need it. \n- **No more surprises**. \n- **No more scrambling**. \n\nJust real-time weather mastery that saves your schedule.\n\n**You’re not just traveling: you’re dominating.**\nThis flow makes sure the only thing you worry about is your next move, not whether the weather’s gonna ruin it. Time to upgrade from a tourist to a boss.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n📅 **Google Calendar Triggers** (Event Created/Updated): \nThe workflow starts immediately upon creation or update of any calendar event, enabling real-time detection of new or changed travel plans.\n\n✈ **Identify Trips**: \nFilters these calendar events to detect travel-related trips by matching keywords such as \"trip,\" \"flight,\" or \"vacation\" in titles or descriptions.\n\n📍**Extract Locations**: \nParses each trip event’s details to extract start and end dates and the trip destination from the summary/description/location fields.\n\n🌐 **Build interrogation URL**: \nConstructs a Visual Crossing API request URL dynamically based on the extracted trip location and dates, including daily forecasts and alerts.\nFetches the detailed weather forecast and alert data for the trip location and duration right after detecting the event.\nFormats the raw weather data into a readable summary 🌤️🌪🌀 including temperatures, precipitation probabilities, conditions, and eventual severe weather alerts.\n\n📲 📧 **Send Forecast**: \nSends the forecast summary with alerts via Telegram to keep the user informed instantly.\n\n⌛**One day before the trip**: \nPauses the workflow until exactly one day before the trip start date, ensuring a timely second fetch when more accurate or updated weather data is available and the updated forecast is sent.\n\n## Optional\nYou can replace the Telegram node with email, WhatsApp, Slack, SMS notifications, or add multiple notification nodes to receive them across all desired channels.",
