# Automate trend research to blog content with GPT-4o, DALL-E & Apify to Notion

> AI Editor-in-Chief: Trend Research to 3 Notion Blog Drafts
This workflow acts as your personal "AI Editor-in-Chief," fully automating the process from trend research to content creation. It scrapes Google Search results and generates three distinct article drafts (with different angles) complete with AI-generated cover images, saving everything directly to Notion.
🎯 Target Audience
Bloggers & Affiliate Marketers: Individuals who struggle with writer's block and want to maintain a consistent posting schedule.
Content Marketers & Editors: Teams running owned media who need to efficiently generate high-volume article ideas and drafts based on trends.
SEO Specialists: Professionals who need to quickly create content based on the latest search keywords.
⚙️ How it Works & Features
This workflow automates the entire editorial process:
Automated Research: Scrapes top Google Search results for a specific keyword (e.g., "2025 AI Tools") using Apify.
Multi-Angle Planning: GPT-4o analyzes the research and brainstorms article concepts from 3 different perspectives (e.g., "Beginner's Guide," "Critical Review," "Business Use Case").
Writing & Visualizing: For each concept, the AI writes a full article body in Markdown and DALL-E 3 generates a matching cover image.
CMS Entry: Automatically saves the Title, Body Text, and Cover Image URL into a Notion database as a draft.
Notification: Sends a completion report with links to the created Notion pages via Slack.
