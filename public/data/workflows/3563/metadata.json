  "title": "Build an AI powered phone agent 📞🤖 with Retell, Google Calendar and RAG",
  "description": "This Workflow simulates an AI-powered phone agent with [RetellAI](https://dashboard.retellai.com/?ref=davide) with two main functions:\n\n1. **📅 Appointment Booking** – It can schedule appointments directly into Google Calendar.  \n2. **🧠 RAG-based Information Retrieval** – It provides answers using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. For example, it can respond to questions such as store opening hours, return policies, or product details.\n\nThe guide also explains **how to purchase a dedicated phone number** (with a +1 prefix) and link it to the AI agent. This setup is cost-effective, as it uses a **FREE $10 credit** to operate without additional charges in the beginning.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/brtBkgfH/Retellai-flow.png)\n\n---\n\n### **✨ Advantages**\n\n- **🕐 24/7 Availability** – The AI agent can answer calls and assist customers at any time.  \n- **🤖 Automation** – It reduces the workload on human staff by handling repetitive tasks like appointment scheduling and FAQ responses.  \n- **🔌 Easy Integration** – Built with n8n, it’s flexible and customizable for various platforms and tools.  \n- **💸 Low-cost Setup** – Using the free credit, businesses can get started without an upfront investment.\n\n---\n\n### **📦 Use Cases**\n\n- **🛍 E-commerce** – Answer common product questions or order inquiries.  \n- **🏬 Retail Stores** – Provide store hours, address info, and return policies.  \n- **🍽 Restaurants** – Take reservations or share menu information.  \n- **💼 Service Providers** – Book appointments or consultations.  \n- **📞 Any Local Business** – Offer phone support without needing a live operator.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \nThis Workflow simulates an AI-powered phone agent with two primary functions:  \n\n1. **Appointment Booking**  \n   - The workflow captures call events (e.g., `call_ended` or `call_analyzed`) and extracts key details (transcript, caller info, duration, etc.).  \n   - Using OpenAI, it summarizes the conversation and parses structured data (e.g., names, contact info, dates).  \n   - For scheduling, it converts user-provided dates into Google Calendar-compatible formats and creates events automatically.  \n\n2. **RAG-Based Information Retrieval**  \n   - When a query is received (e.g., store hours, product details), the workflow retrieves relevant information from a Qdrant vector store.  \n   - An AI agent processes the query using the retrieved data and responds via a webhook, ensuring accurate, context-aware answers.   \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Prepare Qdrant Vector Store**  \n   - Create/refresh a Qdrant collection (via HTTP requests).  \n   - Upload and vectorize documents (e.g., from Google Drive) using OpenAI embeddings.  \n\n2. **Configure RetellAI Agent**  \n   - Sign up for [RetellAI](https://dashboard.retellai.com/?ref=davide), create an agent, and set the webhook URLs (`n8n_call` for call events, `n8n_rag_function` for RAG queries).  \n   - Purchase a Twilio phone number and link it to the agent.  \n\n3. **n8n Workflow Setup**  \n   - Connect OpenAI, Qdrant, Google Calendar, and Telegram nodes with credentials.  \n   - Customize prompts for summarization, date parsing, and RAG responses.  \n   - Test the workflow to ensure data flows from call events → processing → actions (e.g., calendar bookings, Telegram alerts).  \n\n4. **Deploy**  \n   - Trigger the workflow via RetellAI webhooks during calls.  \n   - Monitor outputs (e.g., call summaries in Telegram, calendar events).  \n\n**Note**: Replace placeholders (e.g., `QDRANTURL`, `COLLECTION`, `CHAT_ID`) with actual values. \n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
