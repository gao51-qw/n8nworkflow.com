  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nB2B marketers, recruiters, and personal-brand builders who want to spark\nconversations on LinkedIn by automatically posting short, relevant comments on\nfresh industry content—while staying under daily limits.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** fires every hour.  \n2. **Select Cookie** picks a rotating LinkedIn session-cookie (time-slice logic).  \n3. **Generate Random Search Term** (GPT-4o) outputs a realistic AI/BPA keyword.  \n4. **LinkedIn Search Agent** (Phantombuster) scrapes recent posts.  \n5. **Get Random Post** chooses one post and passes its text to **Create Comment**\n   (GPT-4o) which returns a ≤150-character reply in the chosen language.  \n6. Builds `linkedin_posts_to_comment.csv`, uploads to SharePoint, and launches\n   the **Auto-comment Agent** to post the reply.  \n7. Post URL is logged to `linkedin_posts_already_commented.csv` to avoid\n   duplicates.  \n8. **Wait** nodes throttle launches to ~120 comments/day.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  \n   • `linkedin_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n   • `linkedin_posts_already_commented.csv` with header `postUrl`.  \n3. Edit **Set ENV Variables** to set default language, comment prompt,\n   company ID, etc.  \n4. Adjust schedule or comments-per-launch as needed.  \n5. Activate the workflow; it will run hourly and comment on one new post each\n   launch.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33 +  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- OpenAI account \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Change tone/length: edit the prompt in **Create Comment**.  \n- Comment more often: raise `numberOfLinesPerLaunch` and schedule frequency.  \n- Use Google Drive/Dropbox instead of SharePoint by swapping storage nodes.",
