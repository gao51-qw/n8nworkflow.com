  "description": "### Who’s it for\n\nThis workflow is ideal for **community managers, event organizers, and businesses** that regularly manage multiple WhatsApp groups. If you have a growing list of invitation codes stored in **Google Sheets**, this automation helps you automatically join groups, update statuses, and track results without manual work.\n\n### How it works / What it does\n\nThe workflow connects **Google Sheets** with WhatsApp through an automation sequence:\n\n* Reads the list of invitation codes from a Google Sheet.\n* Processes the first 50 unused codes per run.\n* Validates group links via a **Fetch groups** node.\n* Attempts to join each group using the **Join group** node.\n* Updates the sheet with the join status (success or failure).\n* Logs successful joins in a tracking list for easy follow-up.\n\nThis ensures a fully automated way to manage WhatsApp group invitations while keeping your data organized in Google Sheets.\n\n### How to set up\n\n1. Prepare a Google Sheet with invitation codes and a status column.\n2. Configure the **Google Sheets node** with read and write access.\n3. Set up your **fetch-groups** and **join-group** credentials.\n4. Adjust the **Schedule Trigger** to define how often the workflow should run.\n5. Test with a few sample codes before scaling.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* n8n (self-hosted or cloud).\n* Google Sheets API credentials.\n* WhatsApp integration (via \\[Evolution API] or another community node — self-hosted only).\n\n### How to customize the workflow\n\n* Change the batch size (default: 50 codes per run).\n* Add error handling or retry logic for invalid links.\n* Send real-time notifications (Slack, email, or Telegram) after each join.\n* Extend your Google Sheet schema with extra details (e.g., group category, campaign, date joined).\n",
