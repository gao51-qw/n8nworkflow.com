## 🎥 YouTube Video AI Agent Workflow

This n8n workflow template allows you to interact with an AI agent that extracts details and the transcript of a YouTube video using a provided video ID. Once the details and transcript are retrieved, you can chat with the AI agent to explore or analyze the video's content in a conversational and insightful manner.

### 🌟 How the Workflow Works
1. **🔗 Input Video ID**: The user provides a YouTube video ID as input to the workflow.
   
2. **📄 Data Retrieval**: The workflow fetches essential details about the video (e.g., title, description, upload date) and retrieves its transcript using YouTube's Data API and additional tools for transcript extraction.

3. **🤖 AI Agent Interaction**: The extracted details and transcript are processed by an AI-powered agent. Users can then ask questions or engage in a conversation with the agent about the video's content, such as:
   - Summarizing the transcript.
   - Analyzing key points.
   - Clarifying specific sections.

4. **💬 Dynamic Responses**: The AI agent uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate contextual and accurate responses based on the video data, ensuring a smooth and intuitive interaction.
