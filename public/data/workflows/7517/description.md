Who's it for
Marketing teams, social media managers, content creators, and small businesses looking to maintain consistent social media presence across multiple platforms. Perfect for organizations that want to automate content creation while maintaining quality and brand consistency.
How it works
This workflow creates a complete social media automation system that generates platform-specific content using AI and schedules posts across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram based on your content calendar in Google Sheets.
The system runs daily at 9 AM, reading your content calendar to identify scheduled topics for the day. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate platform-optimized content that follows each platform's best practices - concise engaging posts for Twitter, professional thought leadership for LinkedIn, and visual storytelling for Instagram. DALL-E creates accompanying images that match your brand style and topic themes.
Each piece of content is automatically formatted for optimal engagement, including appropriate hashtags, character limits, and platform-specific calls-to-action. The workflow then schedules posts through Buffer's API at optimal times and updates your spreadsheet with posting status, content previews, and generated image URLs for tracking and approval workflows.
