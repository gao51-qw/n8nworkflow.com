This workflow template creates an audio stream session on UltraVox compatible with Plivo and sends it to Plivo.

How It Works : 
Plivo initiates a call and requests the Answer URL.

The workflow responds with Plivo XML to join the session.

Note:
Ensure you update the UltraVox API Key in the credentials.
Update System Prompt based on your requirements.
