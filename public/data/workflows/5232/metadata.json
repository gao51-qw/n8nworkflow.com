  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* \n\n## How It Works\nThis template orchestrates a multi-step workflow that constructs a comprehensive four-zone automation matrix—Green, Yellow, Red, and White—grounded in the Human Agency Scale (HAS). When a user sends a job title via Telegram, the workflow routes both text and voice messages appropriately. Voice messages are transcribed via OpenAI's Whisper, while text inputs bypass transcription. Both streams merge into a single data flow. The AI Agent node, powered by GPT-4, analyzes the user's profession and core tasks. It also leverages live context by calling the Tavily search tool, ensuring the analysis incorporates up-to-date information. After the evaluation, the workflow formats and returns the completed matrix, with detailed task examples and rationales for each zone, back to the user via Telegram.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Create an OpenAI credential in n8n (model: GPT-4.1 mini).\n2. Add a Tavily credential with your API key (FREE plan available).\n3. Configure a Telegram Bot credential: API bot token.\n4. Import this JSON as a new workflow in n8n and map credentials in each node.\n5. Activate the workflow; test by sending sample job titles; adjust node timeouts and webhook settings as needed.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n v1.0.0 or higher\n- Active OpenAI API key (GPT-4.1 mini access)\n- Tavily API key for web context search\n- Telegram Bot token with correctly configured webhook\n- Stable internet connectivity\n\n## Audience & Problem\nThis template is designed for consultants, HR professionals, and analysts who need a scalable, standardized approach to evaluate which routine tasks in a given profession can be automated, which require human oversight, and which should remain manual to preserve strategic judgment, creativity, and expertise.\n",
