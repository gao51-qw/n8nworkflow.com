  "description": "## Make OpenAI Citation for File Retrieval RAG\n\n## Use case\n\nIn this example, we will ensure that all texts from the OpenAI assistant search for citations and sources in the vector store files. We can also format the output for Markdown or HTML tags.\n\nThis is necessary because the assistant sometimes generates strange characters, and we can also use dynamic references such as citations 1, 2, 3, for example.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nIn this workflow, we will use an OpenAI assistant created within their interface, equipped with a vector store containing some files for file retrieval.\n\nThe assistant will perform the file search within the OpenAI infrastructure and will return the content with citations.\n\n- We will make an HTTP request to retrieve all the details we need to format the text output.\n\n## Setup\n\nInsert an OpenAI Key\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n\nAt the end of the workflow, we have a block of code that will format the output, and there we can add Markdown tags to create links. Optionally, we can transform the Markdown formatting into HTML.\n",
