## Description:
Keep your API documentation accurate and reliable with this n8n automation template.
 The workflow automatically tests your FAQ content related to authentication and rate limits, evaluating each answer using Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for completeness, edge-case coverage, and technical clarity. It logs all results to Google Sheets, scores FAQs from 0–10, and sends Slack alerts when low-quality answers are detected.
Ideal for API teams, developer relations managers, and technical writers who want to maintain high-quality documentation with zero manual review effort.

## ✅ What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)

▶️ Manual Trigger or On-Demand Run
 Start the evaluation anytime you update your FAQs — perfect for regression testing before documentation releases.

📖 Fetch FAQ Q&A from Google Sheets
 Reads FAQ questions and answers from your designated test sheet (columns A:B). Each Q&A pair becomes a test case for AI evaluation.

🤖 AI Evaluation via GPT-4o-mini
 Uses Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to evaluate how well each FAQ covers critical aspects of API authentication and rate limiting.
 The AI provides a numeric score (0–10) and a short explanation.

🔍 Parse & Format AI Results
 Extracts structured JSON data (Question, Score, Explanation, Timestamp) and prepares it for reporting and filtering.

💾 Save Evaluation to Google Sheets
 Appends all results to a Results Sheet (A:D) — creating a running history of FAQ quality audits.

⚠️ Filter for Low-Scoring FAQs
 Identifies any FAQ with a score below 7, flagging them as needing review or rewrite.
