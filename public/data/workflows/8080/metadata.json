  "description": "## How it works\n- This workflow will trigger upon new mail in your gmail inbox and will automatically apply existing labels OR identify, create, then apply up to 5 new labels.\n- This is currently set up to run using a OpenAI endpoint which I have set up connected to my local llama.cpp server running.\n- After your email is done labeling, the workflow will send you a nice notification in your discord channel!\n\n## Set up Instructions\n- This workflow requires a Gmail OAuth account credential with the ability to create labels and label messages\n- [OPTIONAL] You can create a Discord Bot Account which connects with a Bot Token which will summarize the email and show you which labels were created and added in the workflow.\n- You might want to tweak the prompts a bit based on how detailed you want your labels. I've found after running it for a bit that the labels that get created mostly encompass everything I want.\n\n## Workflow Hints\n- The workflow works in 5 phases\n-- **Phase 1:** Find existing Gmail labels as options for the LLM to choose from. \n-- **Phase 2:** LLM chooses labels or defines new ones\n-- **Phase 3:** Create additional Gmail labels if needed\n-- **Phase 4:** Label the message with newly created and existing labels\n-- **Phase 5:** Rewrite and send a message notification via Discord.\n\nScreenshot 1:\n![Screenshot 20250831 at 9.06.29 PM.png](fileId:2291)\n_Note: colors are my own_\n\n![Screenshot 20250831 at 9.09.01 PM.png](fileId:2292)\n_Screenshot of notification sent via discord_\n\n## Model Tips\n- I set this up to run completely using offline models. I had good success with Llama.cpp server with gpt-oss-20B and with a bit more tweaking could get it to work with a smaller gemma3-4b model mostly likely as well.\n- The whole workflow runs in about 5-10 seconds on my Blackwell Nvidia GPU. Probably would be a few seconds slower on an older piece of hardware.",
