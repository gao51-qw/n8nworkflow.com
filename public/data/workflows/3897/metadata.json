  "description": "## Sync Youtube Videos with Google Sheets\n**(Part 1 of Youtube comments sentiment analyze automation along with detailed dashboard)**\n\nThis workflow is the **first part of a multi-part automation system** designed to perform large-scale YouTube comment sentiment analysis alongwith detailed dashboard. It solves the problem of manually tracking new videos across multiple YouTube channels by automatically fetching and organizing video URLs in a Google Sheet, setting the stage for deeper analysis in Part 2.\n\n### What It Does\n1. **Reads Channel IDs** from `Sheet3` of a connected Google Sheet.\n2. **Fetches the latest videos** from each Channel ID using the **YouTube Data API**.\n3. **Extracts video URLs and metadata** (like title and publish date).\n4. **Appends the video data** to `Sheet2` of the same Google Sheet — this sheet is later used by Part 2 for further processing.\n\n### Part of a Multi-Step System\nThis is **Part 1** of a 2-workflow system:\n- **Part 1 (this workflow)** populates a sheet with the latest videos from a list of channels.\n- **Part 2** reads the video URLs from `Sheet2`, fetches comments for each video, analyzes their sentiment using **OpenAI**, and stores structured results in `Sheet1`.\n\n👉 Continue to [Part 2 – YouTube Comment Sentiment Analyzer with Google Sheets & OpenAI](https://n8n.io/workflows/3855-youtube-comment-sentiment-analyzer-with-google-sheets-and-openai/)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Use Cases\n- Monitor and organize new videos from a list of YouTube channels\n- Automate content pipelines for social media teams and analysts\n- Build scalable datasets for comment and sentiment analysis\n- Perfect for creators, agencies, or data analysts managing multiple YouTube accounts\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Apps Used\n- **Google Sheets** – To read and write channel/video data\n- **YouTube** – To fetch video data from public channels\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Why Use This?\nManually checking YouTube channels for new content is time-consuming and error-prone. This automation ensures your data stays current and structured — enabling consistent tracking and deeper analysis (especially when paired with Part 2). It brings speed, scale, and automation to your YouTube content operations.\n\n---\n\n## How to Customize\n\n### 1. Modify Trigger Settings\n- Change the **Google Sheet (Sheet 3)** channel ID entry to track other channels.\n- Use a **time-based trigger** to fetch new videos regularly, ensuring your data stays up to date.\n\n### 2. Adjust Output Fields\n- Fetch **additional details** from YouTube, such as view count, description, or thumbnails.\n- Add **custom columns** in **Sheet 2** for organizing videos by different criteria, such as:\n  - \"Published Date\"\n  - \"Video Type\"\n  - \"View Count\"\n  - \"Video Description\"\n\n### 3. Extend with Integrations\n- Integrate with other workflows like **YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis** (Part 2) for a deeper dive into content analysis.\n- Use **filters** to fetch videos by certain tags, keywords, or publish dates.\n\n### 4. Adjust Sheet Structure\n- Modify the structure of **Sheet 2** to categorize videos based on criteria like:\n  - Channel\n  - Video Status (e.g., \"Published,\" \"Scheduled\")\n  - Video Type (e.g., \"Tutorial,\" \"Review\")\n\n### 5. Schedule Regular Fetching\n- Set a **schedule trigger** to fetch videos at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly), ensuring new content is automatically added to your sheet.\n\n### 6. Customize Google Sheet Layout\n- Change the layout of **Sheet 2** to better fit your needs. For example, you can add additional columns for\n",
