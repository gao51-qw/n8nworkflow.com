# Automate monthly finance reports with Google Sheets, GPT-4 analysis and Gmail

> ## How It Works ⚙️

This workflow is designed to streamline your monthly financial reporting, turning raw transaction data into actionable insights automatically. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its operation:

1.  **Trigger (Cron Node):** ⏰ The workflow kicks off automatically on a pre-defined schedule, typically the 1st day of every month, ensuring timely report generation without manual intervention.
2.  **Get Finance Transactions (Google Sheets):** 📊 The first functional node connects to your designated Google Sheet. It reads all the transaction data from the specified range (e.g., 'FinanceSummary!A:E'), acting as the primary data input for the report.
3.  **Filter Previous Month Transactions (Function):** 🧹 Once the data is retrieved, this custom JavaScript function meticulously filters out only those transactions that occurred in the complete previous month. This ensures your report is always focused on the most relevant, recently concluded period.
4.  **Generate AI Financial Insights (OpenAI):** 🧠 The filtered transaction data is then passed to OpenAI's GPT-4 model. Here, the AI acts as your personal finance assistant, analyzing the data to:
    * Calculate the total income.
    * Calculate the total expense.
    * Generate 3 concise, key financial insights in bullet points, helping you quickly grasp the financial health and trends.
5.  **Send Monthly Finance Report Email (Gmail):** 📧 Finally, all the processed information comes together. This node constructs a comprehensive email, embedding:
    * A table summarizing all the previous month's transactions.
    * The valuable AI-generated total income, total expense, and key insights.
    The email is then automatically sent to your designated finance recipients, delivering the report directly to their inbox.
