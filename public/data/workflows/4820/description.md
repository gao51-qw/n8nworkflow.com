### Who this is for?

The Search Engine Intelligence Extractor is a powerful n8n automation that leverages Bright Data’s MCP based AI Agents to simulate human-like searches across Google, Bing, and Yandex, and then distills clean, structured insights using Google Gemini.

This workflow is tailored for:

- SEO analysts researching competitors or market trends

- Market researchers needing real-time search visibility

- Journalists & content writers gathering contextual insights

- AI developers creating intelligent assistants

- Digital marketers tracking brand mentions or news

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Traditional scraping of search engines is often blocked, cluttered, or filled with irrelevant information. Manually analyzing and cleaning this data for insight is time-consuming.

This workflow solves the problem by:

- Simulating real user search behavior via Bright Data MCP based AI Agent

- Performing multi-platform search (Google, Bing, Yandex) in one unified flow

- Extracting clean, human-readable results (stripping ads, navigation, etc.)

- Structuring the content using Google Gemini LLM

- Automating delivery via Webhook or saving to disk

### What this workflow does

**Input Fields Node:**

- Accepts the search query

- Accepts action for example - Perform a google search. Replace the action with bing, yandex etc. for other search providers

- Accepts Webhook notification URL

**Bright Data MCP Agent Execution:**

- Triggers Bright Data’s intelligent search agent

- Handles search navigation, result loading, pagination

**Human Readable Data Extractor:**

- Cleanses HTML, removes ads, footers, irrelevant links

- Produces a readable narrative of results

**Final Output Handling:**

- Saves the processed response to disk

- Sends the structured data to a Webhook for real-time use
