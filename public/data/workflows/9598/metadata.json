  "description": "# Workflow Description: Automated YouTube Short Viral History (Blotato + GPT-4.1)\n\nThis workflow is a powerful, self-sustaining **end-to-end content automation pipeline** designed to feed your YouTube Shorts channel with consistent, high-quality, and highly engaging videos focused on **\"What if history...\"** scenarios.\n\nThis solution completely eliminates manual intervention across the creative, production, and publishing stages. It expertly links the creative power of a **GPT-4o AI Agent** with the video rendering capabilities of the **Blotato API**, all orchestrated by **n8n**.\n\n## **How It Works**\n\nThe automation runs through a five-step, scheduled process:\n\n1.  **Trigger and Idea Generation**: The **Schedule Trigger** starts the workflow (default is 10:00 AM daily). The **AI Agent** (GPT-4o) acts as a copywriter/researcher, automatically brainstorming a random \"What if history...\" topic, researching relevant facts, and formulating a viral, hook-driven 60-second video script, along with a title and caption.\n2.  **Visual Production Request**: The formatted script is sent to the **Blotato API** via the **Create Video** node. Blotato begins rendering the text-to-video short based on the pre-set style parameters (**cinematic** style, specific voice ID, and AI models).\n3.  **Status Check and Wait**: The **Wait** node pauses the workflow, and the **Get Video** node continually checks the Blotato system until the video rendering status is confirmed as `done`.\n4.  **Media Upload**: The completed video file is uploaded to the Blotato media library using an **HTTP Request** node, preparing it for publishing.\n5.  **Automated Publishing**: The final **YT Post** node (another HTTP Request to the Blotato API) automatically publishes the video to your linked YouTube channel, using the video URL and the AI-generated title and short caption.\n\n## **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo activate and personalize this powerful content pipeline in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **OpenAI Credential**: Ensure your **OpenAI API** key credential is created and connected to the **Brainstorm Idea** node (Language Model). The workflow uses **GPT-4o** by default.\n2.  **Blotato API Key**: Obtain your **Blotato API Key**.\n    * Open the **Prepare Video** node and manually insert your Blotato API Key into the `blotato_api_key` field.\n3.  **YouTube Account ID**: Find the Account ID (or Channel ID) for the YouTube channel you want to post to.\n    * Open the **Prepare for Publish** node and manually insert your YouTube Account ID into the `youtube_id` field.\n4.  **Customize Video Style (Optional)**: If desired, adjust the visual aesthetic by modifying parameters in the **Prepare Video** node, such as:\n    * `voiceId`: To change the video narrator.\n    * `style`: To change the visual theme (e.g., from `cinematic` to `documentary`).\n    * `text_to_image_model` and `image_to_video_model`: To change the underlying AI generation models.\n5.  **Activate Workflow**: Save the workflow and toggle the main switch to **Active**. The first video will be created and published on the next scheduled run.",
