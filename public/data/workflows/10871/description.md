# Personal Finance AI Agent – Telegram Bot (n8n Workflow)

A fully automated Telegram-based personal finance tracker that:
- Accepts receipts as **images**, **PDFs**, or plain text  
- Uses Google Gemini Vision for OCR & intelligent extraction  
- Logs every expense into **Google Sheets**  
- Stores receipt images/PDFs in **Google Drive**  
- Answers natural-language spending questions ("How much did I spend on food last month?", "Compare this month vs last month", etc.)

Built entirely with **n8n** – 100% self-hostable, no-code/low-code.

## How It Works (Overview)

1. **You send a message to your Telegram bot**  
   → Photo of a receipt, PDF, or just text like "Nov 10 – 2500 NGN – Uber"

2. **Switch node** detects the message type:
   - Photo → Branch 0
   - Document (PDF/other) → Branch 1  
   - Pure text → Branch 2 (goes straight to query agent)

3. **Receipt Processing Path (Images & PDFs)**
   - Files downloaded from Telegram → uploaded to Google Drive ("Monthly receipts" folder)
   - Images → OCR with Gemini Vision  
     PDFs → native PDF text extraction
   - Extracted text + Drive link → merged → sent to Gemini AI Agent
   - AI extracts: Date (YYYY-MM-DD) • Amount (NGN) • Description • Category  
     (food, transportation, subscriptions, takeouts, entertainment, gift, electricity, repairs, other stuffs)
   - Clean JSON → appended to Google Sheets → friendly confirmation sent back

4. **Spending Query Path (Text questions)**
   - Second AI Agent with access to the live Google Sheet + calculator + memory
   - Answers anything: totals, breakdowns, comparisons, trends, percentages…

## Live Google Sheet (Template)
You can make a copy of the exact sheet the bot uses:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kwWJquPpwL9vt9U06a4f4phXq5jZjaGazvh2V69FGoc/edit?usp=sharing

Just click **File → Make a copy** and use your copy’s ID in the workflow.
