# Welcome to my Automated Image Metadata Tagging Workflow!

**DISCLAIMER: This workflow only works with self-hosted n8n instances! You have to install the [n8n-nodes-exif-data Community Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-exif-data)!**

This workflow automatically analyzes the image content with the help of AI and writes it directly back into the image file as keywords.

## This workflow has the following steps:

1. Google Drive trigger (scan for new files added in a specific folder)
2. Download the added image file
3. Analyse the content of the image
4. Merge Metadata and image file
5. Write the Keywords into the Metadata (dc:subject/keywords) and create new image file
6. Update the original file in the Google Drive folder

## The following accesses are required for the workflow:
- **You have to install the [n8n-nodes-exif-data Community Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-exif-data)**
- Google Drive: [Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google)
