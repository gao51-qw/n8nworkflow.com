## Overview  
This workflow converts a single topic into a full blog article through a structured multi-step process. Instead of generating everything in one pass, it breaks the task into clear stages to produce cleaner structure, better SEO consistency, and more predictable output quality.

## How this workflow differs from asking ChatGPT directly  
- It does not produce an article in one step.  
- It separates the process into two focused stages: outline generation and paragraph expansion.  
- This approach gives you more control over tone, SEO, structure, and keyword placement.

## How it works  
### 1. Generate outline  
- The workflow sends your topic to an AI Agent.  
- It returns a structured outline based on the topic, desired depth, language, and keyword focus.

### 2. Expand each subtopic  
- The workflow loops through each outline item.  
- Every subtopic is expanded into a detailed, SEO-friendly paragraph.  
- Output is consistent and optimized for readability.

### 3. Produce final outputs  
- Combines all expanded sections into:  
  - A clean JSON object  
  - A Markdown version ready for blogs or CMS  
- The JSON includes:  
  - Title  
  - HTML content  
  - Markdown content  
- You can send this directly to REST APIs such as WordPress, Notion, or documentation platforms.  
- Content is validated for readability and typically scores well in tools like Yoast SEO.  
- Uses GPT-4o Mini by default, with average token usage between 2000 and 3000 depending on outline size.

## Use cases  
- Auto-generate long-form articles for blogs or content marketing.  
- Turn Instagram or short-form scripts into complete SEO articles.  
- Create documentation or educational content using consistent templates.  

## Setup steps  
### 1. Prepare credentials  
- Add your OpenAI API Key inside n8n’s credential manager.

### 2. Adjust input parameters  
- Topic or main idea  
- Number of outline items  
- Language  
- Primary keyword  
- Tone or writing style (optional)

### 3. Customize the workflow  
- Switch the model if you want higher quality or lower token usage.  
- Modify the prompt for the outline or paragraph generator to match your writing style.  
- Add additional nodes if you want to auto-upload the final article to WordPress, Notion, or any API.

### 4. Run the workflow  
- Enter your topic  
- Execute the workflow  
- Retrieve both JSON and Markdown outputs for immediate publishing
