## 📄 What this workflow does

This workflow automatically scrapes product information from any website URL entered into a Google Sheet and stores the extracted product details into another sheet. It uses Dumpling AI to extract product data such as name, price, description, and reviews.

## 🔁 How it works (Workflow Steps)

1. **Watch New Website URL in Google Sheets**: Triggers when a new row is added with a website URL.
2. **Extract Product Info with Dumpling AI**: Sends the URL to Dumpling AI’s extract endpoint using a defined schema for product details.
3. **Split Extracted Products**: Separates multiple products into individual items if the page contains more than one.
4. **Append Product Info to Google Sheets**: Adds the structured results to the specified product details sheet.
