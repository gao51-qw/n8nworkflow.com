  "description": "What Is TWZ n8n MailPoet Integration?\n\nThis workflow adds subscribers to MailPoet using n8n by bridging WordPress through a custom REST API and logging results in Google Sheets.\n\nMailPoet is a popular WordPress email marketing plugin, but it does not provide a public REST API. Because of this limitation, n8n cannot connect to MailPoet directly using native nodes or standard integrations.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates a practical and production-ready solution for connecting n8n → WordPress → MailPoet using a custom WordPress REST API plugin called [TWZ N8N MailPoet](https://themewizz.com/product/twz-n8n-mailpoet-add-subscriber-api/).\n\n🚧 Problem This Workflow Solves\n\n❌ MailPoet has no public REST API\n❌ n8n cannot add MailPoet subscribers natively\n❌ External forms and automations cannot push data into MailPoet\n\n✅ Solution Architecture\n\nThis workflow solves the problem by:\n\nCreating a secure REST API endpoint inside WordPress\n\nUsing an n8n HTTP Request node to send subscriber data\n\nAdding subscribers directly to MailPoet\n\nPreventing duplicate subscribers\n\nLogging subscribers in Google Sheets for visibility\n\nThis creates a reliable bridge between n8n and MailPoet, enabling automation workflows that were previously not possible.\n\n🔌 How It Works (High Level)\n\n📥 n8n receives form submission data\n🔍 The workflow checks if the subscriber already exists\n📧 The subscriber is added to MailPoet via the custom REST API\n📊 Subscriber data is logged in Google Sheets\n✅ The workflow returns a success or error response\n\n🎯 Why This Workflow Is Useful\n\nWorks around MailPoet’s missing API\n\nEnables full automation from external tools\n\nUses standard n8n nodes (HTTP Request, IF, Google Sheets)\n\nSecure and reusable integration pattern\n\nIdeal for WordPress-based businesses\n\n🧩 About the TWZ n8n MailPoet Plugin\n\nTWZ n8n MailPoet is a free, lightweight WordPress plugin designed to provide a simple and reliable integration between n8n (or any external service) and MailPoet.\n\nIt implements a single MailPoet API operation:\n➡ Add Subscriber\n\nThis keeps the plugin lightweight, fast, and focused.",
