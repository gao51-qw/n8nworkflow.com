  "description": "# Social Media Posting Automation with Image and Caption\n\n## How it works\nThis AI-powered workflow streamlines your social media posting process, transforming hours of manual caption writing, image uploading, and scheduling into a fully automated system. You define the topic and image once, and the workflow handles caption generation, review, approval, and posting to your selected platforms.\n\n### Automated Flow\n\n1. **Generate Caption**  \n   Trigger the workflow manually and set your post topic and image URL in the Set node. The AI (GPT-4.1-mini) generates a high-quality, engaging social media caption tailored to your audience, platform, and content goals.\n\n2. **Store in Google Sheet**  \n   The generated caption, along with your image URL and post metadata, is automatically appended to your Google Sheet. This creates a central location to review and manage all your social media content.\n\n3. **Review and Approve**  \n   You review the generated caption in the sheet, make any edits if needed, and update the status to **Approved**. You can also select the platform(s) where you want to post.\n\n4. **Automatic Posting**  \n   Once the status is updated to Approved, the next workflow is triggered automatically. It posts your caption and image to the selected social media platform(s) without any further manual effort.\n\n**The result?**  \nA seamless, end-to-end social media posting process where captions are AI-generated, stored, reviewed, and posted automatically. Focus on strategy and engagement instead of repetitive manual posting.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n**Setup time:** ~10–15 minutes  \n**What you’ll need:** OpenAI API key, Google account, access to your social media platform(s)\n\n1. **Connect Your Google Account**\n   - Click on the Google Sheets node in your workflow.  \n   - Select the Credential dropdown and choose **+ Create New Credential**.  \n   - Authenticate your Google account and grant the necessary permissions.\n\n2. **Initialize Your Spreadsheet**\n   - Run the workflow once by clicking the play button on the start node.  \n   - This will automatically create a Google Sheet with all the required columns for caption tracking and approval.\n\n3. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**\n   - Navigate to the AI Agent node.  \n   - Click the Credential dropdown and select **+ Create New Credential**.  \n   - Paste your OpenAI API key and save.  \n   - Get your API key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n\n4. **Set Post Topic and Image**\n   - Update the title in the Set node with the topic you want to post.  \n   - Add the image URL associated with your post.\n\n5. **Review Captions and Approve**\n   - Open your Google Sheet, review the generated captions, and update the status to **Approved**.  \n   - Select the platform(s) where the post should go live.\n\n6. **Go Live**\n   - Once the status is updated, the workflow will automatically post your content to the selected social media platform(s).  \n   - Sit back and watch your AI-generated captions and images go live automatically.\n\n**Ready to automate your social media?** Activate your workflow and start posting smarter today! 🚀💡✅\n",
