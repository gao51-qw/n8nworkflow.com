### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually reading, summarizing, and formatting multiple articles into a newsletter takes time and focus. This workflow automates the process using Dumpling AI for crawling, GPT-4o for summarization, and Gmail for delivery—so you can go from raw URLs to a polished email in minutes.

---

### What this workflow does

- Starts manually (can also be scheduled)
- Reads a list of article URLs from Google Sheets
- Sends URLs to Dumpling AI to crawl and extract content
- Splits each article into a single item for processing
- Uses a Code node to clean and structure article data
- Uses an Edit Fields node to merge articles into one JSON block
- GPT-4o summarizes and generates HTML content for the newsletter
- Sends the formatted newsletter via Gmail

---

### Setup

1. **Google Sheets**
   - Create a sheet with a column (A) for article URLs
   - Update the `Read URLs from Google Sheet` node to use your Sheet ID and tab name
   - Connect your Google account in the credentials

2. **Dumpling AI**
   - Sign up at [https://app.dumplingai.com](https://app.dumplingai.com)
   - Create an agent for web crawling under `/crawl`
   - Add your Dumpling API key in the HTTP headers of the `Crawl Content with Dumpling AI` node

3. **Split Node**
   - Breaks apart the array of articles from Dumpling AI so each article is processed individually

4. **Code Node**
   - Structures each article as JSON with `title`, `url`, and cleaned `text` content

5. **Edit Fields Node**
   - Gathers all structured articles back into a single JSON array to prepare for AI summarization

6. **OpenAI (GPT-4o)**
   - Processes the article list and returns a formatted subject line and HTML newsletter content

7. **Gmail**
   - Connect your Gmail account to send the AI-generated newsletter to your inbox or team
   - Update the recipient field in the `Send HTML Email via Gmail` node

---

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- Replace the manual trigger with a `Schedule` node to send newsletters weekly
- Modify the GPT-4o prompt to change tone (e.g., more professional, funny, casual)
- Add filtering logic to skip low-value articles
- Connect Slack, Airtable, or Notion for internal team usage
- Change Gmail to SendGrid or Outlook if preferred

---

### Final Notes

This workflow uses:
- **Dumpling AI** `/crawl` endpoint to extract article content
- **Split**, **Code**, and **Edit Fields** nodes to format multi-article input
- **GPT-4o** for summarization and HTML formatting
- **Gmail** for delivery

This setup eliminates manual steps and delivers fast, consistent newsletters powered by AI.
