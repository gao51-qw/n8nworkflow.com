This workflow automatically discovers what your community is struggling with and writes genuine, helpful posts that position you as a trusted problem-solver.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis workflow runs on autopilot to:\n1. Scan your target Facebook groups for recent posts\n2. Identify the most common problems and pain points\n3. Analyze the community's language and communication style\n4. Generate authentic, value-packed posts that solve real problems\n5. Save ready-to-publish content to your Google Sheet\n\n## What You'll Need\n\n- Google Sheets account (for group URLs and post storage)\n- PAID Apify account with Facebook Groups Scraper actor\n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 recommended)\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n## Quick Setup\n\n1. **Import workflow** and connect your Google Sheets\n2. **Add your Apify API key** and configure the Facebook scraper\n3. **Insert OpenAI API keys** in the three AI nodes\n4. **List your FB groups** in the input sheet (URL, Name, Niche)\n5. **Test manually**, then schedule to run daily/weekly\n\n## Results\n\nGet 2 post variations for each identified problem, written in the group's natural tone and style. Posts are non-promotional, genuinely helpful, and designed to spark engagement while building trust.\n\n**Time saved:** 3-5 hours per week of manual group monitoring and content creation\n",
