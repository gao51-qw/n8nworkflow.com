  "description": "## Telegram ticket intake and status tracking with Postgres\n\n### Who’s it for\nAnyone running support requests through Telegram, Email, Webhooks, and so on who needs a lightweight ticketing system without paying Zendesk prices. Ideal for small teams, freelancers, or businesses that want tickets logged in a structured database (Postgres) and tracked automatically. I'm using Telegram since it's the most convenient one.\n\n### How it works / What it does\nThis workflow turns (Telegram) into a support desk:\n1. **Receives new requests** via a Telegram bot command.  \n2. **Creates a ticket** in a Postgres database with a correlation ID, requester details, and status.  \n3. **Auto-confirms back to the requester** with the ticket ID.  \n4. **Provides ticket updates** (status changes, resolutions) when queried.  \n5. **Keeps data clean** using dedupe keys and controlled input handling.  \n\n### How to set up\n1. Create a Telegram bot using [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and grab the token.  \n2. Connect your Postgres database to n8n and create a `tickets` table:  \n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE tickets (\n  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  correlation_id UUID,\n  source TEXT,\n  external_id TEXT,\n  requester_name TEXT,\n  requester_email TEXT,\n  requester_phone TEXT,\n  subject TEXT,\n  description TEXT,\n  status TEXT,\n  priority TEXT,\n  dedupe_key TEXT,\n  chat_id TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n```\n\n3. Add your Telegram and Postgres credentials in n8n (via the **Credentials** tab, not hardcoded).  \n4. Import the workflow JSON and replace the placeholder credentials with yours.  \n5. Test by sending `/new` in Telegram and follow the prompts.\n\n### Requirements\n- n8n (latest version recommended)  \n- Telegram bot token  \n- Postgres instance (local, Docker, or cloud)  \n\n### How to customize the workflow\n- Change database fields if you need more requester info.  \n- Tweak the **Switch node** and **Comands** for multiple status types.  \n- Extend with Slack, Discord, or email nodes for broader notifications.  \n- Integrate with external systems (CRM, project management) by adding more branches.  \n",
