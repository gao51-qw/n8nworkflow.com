# Generate SEO FAQ content with OpenAI GPT-4o from Google Sheets to WordPress

> # Auto-Generate SEO FAQ Answers from Google Sheets with OpenAI

## Intro/Overview

This workflow automates the process of generating SEO-optimized FAQ answers using AI, pulling questions from a Google Sheet and writing answers back into the same sheet. It’s ideal for content marketers, SEO specialists, and digital teams looking to scale FAQ content generation with minimal manual input.

By combining the power of Google Sheets, AI, and WordPress, the workflow transforms raw questions into structured, keyword-targeted answers tailored for specific audiences — ready for use on landing pages, blogs, or help centers, and automatically publishes them as WordPress posts.

## How it works

- **Schedule Trigger**: Executes the workflow at a set interval to check for new or unprocessed questions in the Google Sheet.

- **Get Questions from Sheet**: Reads from a specific Google Sheet, targeting columns for:
  - `Question` (FAQ prompt)
  - `KW` (target SEO keyword)
  - `Audience` (intended reader)
  - `Article` (desired WordPress post title)

- **Filter**: Ensures only rows without an existing answer are processed (i.e., empty "Answer" column).

- **Generate FAQ Answer**: Passes the question, keyword, and audience to the OpenAI Chat Model using a structured prompt to generate:
  - A concise TL;DR-style summary
  - A detailed, SEO-optimized markdown-formatted answer

- **OpenAI Chat Model**: Utilizes GPT-4 Turbo with a controlled temperature (0.7) and token limit (1000) to produce structured, on-brand, keyword-optimized content.

- **Parse FAQ Answer**: Extracts and formats the AI response into separate fields for writing back to the sheet.

- **Update Sheet with Answer**: Writes the AI-generated answer into the `Answer` column of the same row in the source Google Sheet.

- **WordPress Node**: Publishes each generated answer as a new WordPress post  
  - Uses “Create Post” operation  
  - **Title:** Taken from the `Article` column in the sheet  
  - **Content:** Uses the detailed AI-generated answer  
  - Requires valid WordPress credentials (REST API / Application Password)
