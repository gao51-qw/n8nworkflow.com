  "description": "## How it works\nThe workflow triggers on a new checkout event from Shopify and extracts all relevant cart data. It filters carts based on value and age to isolate qualified abandoned checkouts. For each qualified cart, it sends a follow-up email, updates or creates the corresponding HubSpot contact, and generates a CRM note linked to that contact. Finally, it logs the processed cart into Google Sheets for tracking and review.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n- **Trigger on new Shopify checkout**  \n  - **Shopify Trigger** – Starts the workflow when a new checkout is created.\n\n- **Normalize and structure cart data**  \n  - **Parse Cart Data** – Extracts email, customer name, items, cart totals, timestamps, and hours since creation.\n\n- **Filter carts that meet follow-up criteria**  \n  - **Filter Qualified Carts** – Passes only carts older than 12 hours and valued above 50.\n\n- **Send follow-up message**  \n  - **Send a message** – Delivers a reminder email to the customer about the pending checkout.\n\n- **Create or update CRM contact**  \n  - **Create or update a contact** – Ensures the shopper exists as a HubSpot contact.\n\n- **Prepare CRM note details**  \n  - **Generates Note Data** – Builds a structured note containing timing, cart details, and follow-up context.\n\n- **Create the HubSpot note**  \n  - **Create HubSpot Note** – Submits the prepared note to HubSpot’s CRM.\n\n- **Associate note with the contact**  \n  - **Associate Note with Contact in HubSpot** – Links the generated note to the correct HubSpot contact.\n\n- **Record activity in tracker sheet**  \n  - **Log to Google Sheets** – Appends processed cart fields including items, totals, timestamps, and customer info.\n\n## Why use this?\n- Identifies high-value or long-abandoned carts automatically and follows up without manual effort.  \n- Keeps CRM records updated and adds contextual notes sales teams can act on.  \n- Maintains a structured audit trail of every abandoned cart interaction.  \n- Improves recovery chances by combining email outreach with CRM enrichment and logging.  \n- Enables analysis of abandoned checkout patterns directly from Google Sheets.\n",
