## How it works
The workflow triggers on a new checkout event from Shopify and extracts all relevant cart data. It filters carts based on value and age to isolate qualified abandoned checkouts. For each qualified cart, it sends a follow-up email, updates or creates the corresponding HubSpot contact, and generates a CRM note linked to that contact. Finally, it logs the processed cart into Google Sheets for tracking and review.
