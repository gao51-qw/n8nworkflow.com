  "description": "This workflow shows a low code approach to parsing an XML file and storing its contents in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.\n\n![image.png](fileId:681)\n\nTo run the workflow:\n\n* Make sure you are running n8n 0.197 or newer\n* Have n8n authenticated with Google Sheets\n\nHow it's done:\n\n1. This workflow first downloads an example file using the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node and reads this file using the [XML](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/) node.\n![image.png](fileId:682)\n2. It then runs the [Item Lists](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.itemlists/) node to split out the individual `food` items from the example file.\n3. It then splits up the workflow into a separate branch creating a new spreadsheet file using the [Google Sheets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/) node. To read the column names we're using the [Object.keys()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) method inside a [Set](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node.\n4. Once the spreadsheet is created (the workflow waits for this using the [Merge](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node), the data is appended to the newly created sheet (again using the [Google Sheets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/) node).",
