This automated workflow takes a Typeform form, and once it is filled out, it is automatically uploaded as a Lead in Pipedrive.  There is an option for custom fields (this workflow works with company size), and leaves notes in the note section based on questions answered. 

## Prerequisites
- Typeform account and [Typeform credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/typeform/) and a form for people to fill out
- Pipedrive account and [Pipedrive credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/credentials/pipedrive/)

## Nodes
- Typeform node gets the data after the survey is completed
- Set node extracts data from the Typeform node and keeps only relevant data
- Function node maps the company size 
- Pipedrive node populates a pipeline with a deal and adds custom fields
