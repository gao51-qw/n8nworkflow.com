# IP Reputation Check & Threat Summary using Splunk + VirusTotal + AlienVault + n8n

This workflow automates IP reputation analysis using **Splunk alerts**, enriches data via **VirusTotal** and **AlienVault OTX**, and generates actionable threat summaries for SOC teams — all without any coding.

## What It Does

When a Splunk alert contains a suspicious IP:

- **Ingests the IP** from the Splunk alert via webhook.
- **Performs dual threat enrichment** using:
  - VirusTotal IP reputation & tags.
  - AlienVault OTX pulses, reputation & WHOIS.
- **Merges & processes** threat intel data.
- **Generates a rich HTML summary** for analyst review.
- **Routes action based on severity**:
  - Sends Slack alert for suspicious IPs.
  - Creates an incident in ServiceNow.
  - Emails a formatted HTML report to the SOC inbox.
