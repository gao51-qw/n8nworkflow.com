## How It Works ⚙️

1.  **📥 Application Submitted**: The workflow starts when a candidate fills out the **n8n Form Trigger** with their details and uploads their CV.
2.  **📂 File Processing**: The CV is automatically uploaded to a specific **Google Drive** folder for record-keeping, and the **Extract from File** node reads its text content.
3.  **🧠 AI Screening Agent**: A **LangChain Agent** analyzes the resume text. It uses the **Google Sheets Tool** to look up the requirements for the applied role, then scores the candidate and decides if they should be shortlisted.
4.  **📊 Log Results**: The agent's decision (name, score, shortlisted status) is logged in your master "Applications" **Google Sheet**.
5.  **✅ Qualification Check**: An **IF** node checks if the candidate was shortlisted.
6.  **❓ AI Question Generator**: If shortlisted, a second **LangChain Agent** generates three unique, relevant interview questions based on the candidate's resume and the job description.
7.  **✍️ Update Sheet**: The generated questions are added to the candidate's row in the **Google Sheet**.
8.  **🔔 Notify Team**: A final alert is sent via **Telegram** to notify the HR team that a new candidate has been qualified and is ready for review.

## 🛠️ How to Build This Workflow

Follow these steps to build the recruitment assistant from a blank canvas.

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Application Intake**
1.  Add a **Form Trigger** node. Configure it with fields for `Name`, `Email`, `Phone Number`, a `File Upload` for the CV, and a `Dropdown` for the "Job Role".
2.  Connect a **Google Drive** node. Set the Operation to `Upload` and connect your credentials. Set it to upload the CV file from the Form Trigger into a specific folder.
3.  Add an **Extract from File** node. Set it to extract text from the PDF CV file provided by the trigger.

#### **Step 2: Build the AI Screening Agent**
1.  Add a **Langchain Agent** node. This will be your main screening agent.
2.  In its prompt, instruct the AI to act as a resume screener. Tell it to use the input text from the **Extract from File** node and the tools you will provide to score and shortlist candidates.
3.  Add an **OpenAI Chat Model** node and connect it to the Agent's `Language Model` input.
4.  Add a **Google Sheets Tool** node. Point it to a sheet with your open positions and their requirements. Connect this to the Agent's `Tool` input.
5.  Add a **Structured Output Parser** node and define the JSON structure you want the agent to return (e.g., `candidate_name`, `score`, `shortlisted`). Connect this to the Agent's `Output Parser` input.

#### **Step 3: Log Results & Check for a Match**
1.  Connect a **Google Sheets** node after the Agent. Set its operation to `Append or Update`. Use it to add the structured output from the agent into your main "Applications" sheet.
2.  Add an **IF** node. Set the condition to continue only if the `shortlisted` field equals "yes".

#### **Step 4: Generate Interview Questions**
1.  On the 'true' path of the **IF** node, add a second **Langchain Agent** node.
2.  Write a prompt telling this agent to generate 3 interview questions based on the candidate's resume and the job requirements.
3.  Connect the same **OpenAI Model** and **Google Sheets Tool** to this agent.
4.  Add another **Google Sheets** node. Set it to `Update` the existing row for the candidate, adding the newly generated questions.
