# Filtering and branching data

> **Task:**
Conditional filtering and branching items

**Why:**
Filtering and branching data based on conditions allows you to build complex workflows that work with more than one data flow scenario

**Main use cases:**
 - Filter out data that is not relevant for the rest of the workflow
 - Split data to several branches of the workflow, where we want the data to be treated differently in the rest of the workflow
