    "description": "This workflow demonstrates a simple way to run evals on a set of test cases stored in a Google Sheet.\n\nThe example we are using comes from an info extraction task dataset, where we tested 6 different LLMs on 18 different test cases.\n\nThis workflow extends the functionality of my simple eval for benchmarking legal tasks [here](https://n8n.io/workflows/4712-simple-eval-for-legal-benchmarking/).\n\nRather than running executions sequentially (waiting for each one to respond before making another request), we use parallel processing to fire 2 requests every second.\n\nYou can see our sample data in this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10l_gMtPsge00eTTltGrgvAo54qhh3_twEDsETrQLAGU/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.\n\nOnce you have this working for our dataset, you can plug in your own test cases matching different LLMs to see how it works with your own data.\n\n## How it works\n- Pull our test cases from Google Sheets.\n- For each case, fire off an HTTP request to a webhook.\n- That webhook grabs the relevant source file from Google Drive and converts it to text.\n- The text gets sent to an LLM via Open Router (so we can easily swap out models).\n- Results come back and are logged in Google Sheets.\n\n\n## Set up steps:\n- Add your credentials for Google Sheets, Google Drive, and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).\n- Make a copy of the [original data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10l_gMtPsge00eTTltGrgvAo54qhh3_twEDsETrQLAGU/edit?usp=sharing) so that you can edit it yourself. You will need to plug your version in the Update Results node to see the spreadsheet update on each run of the loop.",

Inventing information = Fail.\n\n2. *Relevance to the Query*  \nThe response must directly answer the specific question asked, without introducing unrelated or off-topic information.\n\n3. *Completeness*  \nThe response must contain enough information to fully answer the question based on the source material.  \nOmitting critical points that are needed to address the query = Fail.\n\n*Key Rule:*  \n- If the output *materially fails any one* of the three requirements, the overall result must be marked *Fail*.\n- Minor phrasing or style issues that do not affect the meaning are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n## Common Failure Patterns to Watch For\n\nBe alert to the following known AI weaknesses:\n\n- Incomplete responses when the task is broad or vague.\n- Fabricated answers when the information is missing from the source.\n- Failure to correctly process or cross-reference multiple documents.\n- Reinforcing incorrect assumptions made in the question without verifying them.\n- Technical failures (e.g., missing pages, unreadable scans) that affect the output.\n- Ignoring contradictory information in the source.\n\nIf any of these issues occur and affect the substantive quality of the response, the correct result is *Fail*.\n\n---\n\n## How to Structure Your Evaluation\n\n*Reasoning:*  \nBriefly explain why you reached this decision.  \nReference the source material where necessary.  \nState clearly whether the AI Assistant’s output was factually correct, relevant, and complete.\n\n*Final Decision:* Pass or Fail\n\nThe output that you give should be given in a JSON format, with keys of \"reasoning\" and \"decision\" as shown in the examples below. Return your answer as a raw JSON object under a top-level key called \"output\" — no markdown, no extra text.\n\n---\n\n## Example 1\n\nINPUT:\n\n{\n  \"task\": \"Extract the liability cap and time-based provisions from a limitation of liability clause.\",\n  \"source\": \"- The liability cap figure is redacted.\\n- There is no 12-month time limit mentioned.\",\n  \"output\": \"The liability cap is $1 million with a 12-month limit.\"\n}\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"reasoning\": \"The Assistant fabricated a $1 million figure and a 12-month provision that are not found in the source. This breaches factual correctness and completeness. The output would mislead business stakeholders if used without correction.\",\n    \"decision\": \"Fail\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Example 2\n\nINPUT:\n\n{\n  \"task\": \"Identify LinkedIn’s indemnity obligations under a Master Services Agreement.\",\n  \"source\": \"- LinkedIn has no indemnity obligations under the agreement.\\n- The indemnities are provided by the vendor only.\",\n  \"output\": \"LinkedIn has no indemnity obligations under this MSA.\"\n}\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"reasoning\": \"The Assistant correctly identified that LinkedIn has no indemnity obligations, fully answering the query.
