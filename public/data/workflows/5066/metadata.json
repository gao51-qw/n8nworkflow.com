  "description": "This workflow demonstrates a simple way to run evals on a set of test cases stored in a Google Sheet.\n\nThe example we are using comes from an info extraction task dataset, where we tested 6 different LLMs on 18 different test cases.\n\nThis workflow extends the functionality of my simple eval for benchmarking legal tasks [here](https://n8n.io/workflows/4712-simple-eval-for-legal-benchmarking/).\n\nRather than running executions sequentially (waiting for each one to respond before making another request), we use parallel processing to fire 2 requests every second.\n\nYou can see our sample data in this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10l_gMtPsge00eTTltGrgvAo54qhh3_twEDsETrQLAGU/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.\n\nOnce you have this working for our dataset, you can plug in your own test cases matching different LLMs to see how it works with your own data.\n\n## How it works\n- Pull our test cases from Google Sheets.\n- For each case, fire off an HTTP request to a webhook.\n- That webhook grabs the relevant source file from Google Drive and converts it to text.\n- The text gets sent to an LLM via Open Router (so we can easily swap out models).\n- Results come back and are logged in Google Sheets.\n\n\n## Set up steps:\n- Add your credentials for Google Sheets, Google Drive, and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).\n- Make a copy of the [original data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10l_gMtPsge00eTTltGrgvAo54qhh3_twEDsETrQLAGU/edit?usp=sharing) so that you can edit it yourself. You will need to plug your version in the Update Results node to see the spreadsheet update on each run of the loop.",
