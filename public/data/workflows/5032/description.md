## Reusable and Independently Testable Sub-workflow
This n8n workflow provides a standardized structure for building and testing sub-workflows in isolation. Its purpose is to help you create robust, reusable, and maintainable automations by enabling you to test the sub-workflow's logic without needing a separate parent workflow.
### Setup Instructions:
1. **Define Sub-workflow Inputs**: Double-click the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger** node to define the parameters (e.g., `color`) that your sub-workflow will expect from a parent workflow.
2. **Configure Test Data**: Use the `Test Input` node (an **Edit Fields (Set)** node connected to the **Manual Trigger**) to provide sample data for isolated testing.
3. **Connect Inputs**: The `Combine Input` node (an **Edit Fields (Set)** node) is the entry point for your sub-workflow's core logic. It should have two inputs: one from the `Execute Sub-workflow Trigger` and one from the `Test Input` node.
4. **Merge Inputs**: Ensure the `Combine Input` node has the 'Include Other Input Fields' option enabled to merge data from both the live and test paths seamlessly.
