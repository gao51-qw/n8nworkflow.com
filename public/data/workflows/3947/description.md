### 📌 About this workflow and its creator

Hi! I’m Amanda, a creator of intelligent automations using n8n and Make. I’ve been building AI-powered workflows for over 2 years, always focused on usability and innovation. This one here is very special to me – a truly advanced AI assistant that reads, listens, interprets and responds like a real human 🤖✨

This ready-to-use workflow acts as a powerful AI personal assistant capable of understanding messages via voice, text, documents, or even images. It supports full multi-channel operation (WhatsApp via Evolution API, Instagram, Facebook, and more), and includes advanced RAG capabilities using Supabase + GPT-4o. It’s designed to be highly extensible, with memory, prompt update tools, and knowledge base management.

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **n8n Hosting**  
   This workflow **requires n8n self-hosted** (or n8n Cloud with custom credentials + community nodes enabled).

2. **Create required databases**  
   Use the provided SQL queries inside the `setar_supabase_tabelas_vectoriais`, `criar_cerebro`, and `criar_rag_controle` nodes to initialize:
   - `documents` table for RAG
   - `cerebro` table for prompt
   - `memoria_chat` for session memory
   - `rag_controle` for summaries and indexing

3. **Credentials needed**
   - OpenAI API (for chat, embeddings and Whisper transcription)
   - Redis (for managing message buffer)
   - Supabase (for vector store + metadata)
   - Postgres (for memory and prompts)
   - Evolution API (or other messaging platforms)

4. **Webhook**
   Set the webhook path to receive messages from your Evolution or WhatsApp API provider.

5. **Configure ‘Set’ node**
   In the `config` node, adjust:
   - `adminNumero`: your personal WhatsApp or admin number
   - `evolutionApiKey`: your private API key
   - `utilizacaoApenasViaAdmin`: toggle if this should only respond to admin numbers

6. **Tool connections**
   Ensure the supporting workflows are also imported and connected for:
   - Emails
   - Knowledge management
   - Calendar events
