  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template is a powerful, reusable utility for managing **stateful, long-running processes**. It allows a main workflow to be paused indefinitely at \"checkpoints\" and then be resumed by external, asynchronous events.\n\nThis pattern is essential for complex automations and I often call it the **\"Async Portal\"** or **\"Teleport\"** pattern.\n\nThe template consists of two distinct parts:\n1.  **The Main Process (Top Flow):** This represents your primary business logic. It starts, performs some actions, and then calls the Portal to register itself before pausing at a `Wait` node (a \"Checkpoint\").\n2.  **The Async Portal (Bottom Flow):** This is the state-management engine. It uses **Workflow Static Data** as a persistent memory to keep track of all paused processes. When an external event (like a new chat message or an approval webhook) comes in with a specific `session_id`, the Portal looks up the corresponding paused workflow and \"teleports\" the new data to it by calling its unique `resume_url`.\n\nThis architecture allows you to build sophisticated systems where the state is managed centrally, and your main business logic remains clean and easy to follow.\n\n## When to use this pattern\n\nThis is an advanced utility ideal for:\n*   **Chatbots:** Maintaining conversation history and context across multiple user messages.\n*   **Human-in-the-Loop Processes:** Pausing a workflow to wait for a manager's approval from an email link or a form submission.\n*   **Multi-Day Sequences:** Building user onboarding flows or drip campaigns that need to pause for hours or days between steps.\n*   **Any process that needs to wait for an unpredictable external event** without timing out.\n\n## Set up steps\n\nThis template is a utility designed to be copied into your own projects. The workflow itself is a live demonstration of how to use it.\n\n1.  **Copy the Async Portal:** In your own project, copy the entire **Async Portal** (the bottom flow, starting with the `A. Entry: Receive Session Info` trigger) into your workflow. This will be your state management engine.\n\n2.  **Register Your Main Process:** At the beginning of your main workflow, use an `Execute Workflow` node to call the Portal's trigger. You must pass it a unique `session_id` for the process and the `resume_url` from a `Wait` node.\n\n3.  **Add Checkpoints:** Place `Wait` nodes in your main workflow wherever you need the process to pause and wait for an external event.\n\n4.  **Trigger the Portal:** Configure your external triggers (e.g., your chatbot's webhook) to call the **Portal's entry trigger**, not your main workflow's trigger. You must pass the same `session_id` so the Portal knows which paused process to resume.\n\n**To see it in action, follow the detailed instructions in the \"How to Test This Workflow\" sticky note on the canvas.**",
