  "description": "This workflow automatically adds a note of the PR from GitHub to the Pipedrive contact if their GitHub email matches a Person in Pipedrive.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Pipedrive account and [Pipedrive credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/pipedrive/)\n- GitHub account and [GitHub credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/github/)\n\n## How it works\n1. GitHub Trigger node activates the workflow when a GitHub user adds a PR.\n2. HTTP Request node gets the user's data and sends it further.\n3. Pipedrive node searches the same email that GitHub user has in Pipedrive.\n4. IF node checks whether a person with the same email exists in Pipedrive.\n5. In case there's such a person in Pipedrive, the Pipedrive node creates a note within the person's profile.\n",
