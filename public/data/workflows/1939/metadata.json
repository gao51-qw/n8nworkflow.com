  "description": "This workflow sends the contents of an email to a Notion database. The email must be labeled with a specific label for the workflow to trigger. The email subject will be the title of the Notion page, and a snippet of the email body will be the content of the Notion page. The email link will be added to the Notion page as a property.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nNotion account and [Notion credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/notion/).\nGoogle account and [Google credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).\n\n## How it works\n\nOn scheduled intervals, find all emails with a specific label. For each email, check if the email already exists in the Notion database. If it does not exist, create a new page in the Notion database, otherwise do nothing. When the task in the Notion database is checked off, the label will be removed from the email.\n\n### Setup\n\nThis workflow requires that you set up a Notion database or use an existing one with at least the following fields:\n\n- Title (title)\n- Thread ID (text)\n- Email thread (URL)\n\nAdditionally, create a label that will be used to trigger the workflow in Gmail. In this workflow, the label is called \"Notion\".",
