Overview

This template connects Telegram with Odoo to let your sales team create sales quotes and check product availability in real-time — just by sending chat messages.

It’s designed for sales representatives, distributors, and small business owners who want to manage quotes and product information quickly without logging into Odoo.

⚙️ How It Works

Once configured, this workflow listens to your Telegram bot for incoming messages.
Based on the message text, it performs different actions in Odoo:

1. Product Queries
Sales reps can ask about products directly in Telegram:

“What’s the price of Product B?”
“How many units of Product A are available?”

The workflow fetches real-time data from Odoo and replies instantly.

2. Sales Quote Creation
Sales reps can also create new sales quotes by typing messages like:

“My customer Amazon, his email address is abc@amazon.com
 wants to buy 10 pcs of Product A and 15 pcs of Product B.”

The workflow extracts relevant details, creates a sales quote in Odoo, and sends confirmation back in Telegram.
