# Create digital checks with OnlineCheckWriter using Forms

> Create Digital Checks with OnlineCheckWriter using Forms
This workflow automates the process of creating and sending digital checks through OnlineCheckWriter's API using user-friendly forms. Perfect for businesses that need to process one-off payments or integrate check payments into their automation workflows.
Prerequisites

API Key: Generate from your OCW dashboard under Settings &gt; API
Verified Bank Account: Add and verify at least one bank account in OCW
Bank Account ID: Found in your OCW dashboard under Bank Accounts

How It Works
This workflow uses a two-step form process:

API Configuration Form: One-time setup to store your OCW credentials
Check Details Form: Collects recipient and payment information for each check

The workflow then automatically:

Validates all required fields
Sends the check request to OnlineCheckWriter's API
Returns a confirmation with the check ID and tracking information

Setup Instructions

Enter your API Key from OnlineCheckWriter
Enter your Bank Account ID
Provide a friendly Account Name for reference

Step 3: Create Checks

Customization Options
Switch to Production
By default, this workflow uses the OCW test environment. To switch to production:

Edit the Send Check via OCW API node
Change URL from https://test.onlinecheckwriter.com/api/v3/quickpay/check to https://app.onlinecheckwriter.com/api/v3/quickpay/check

Add Custom Fields
You can extend the forms with additional fields:

Invoice numbers
Department codes
Project references
Custom metadata

Integrate with Other Systems
Connect this workflow to:

Google Sheets: Track payments in a spreadsheet
Slack: Send notifications when checks are created
Email: Send confirmations to recipients
Accounting Software: Update your books automatically

Error Handling
To add error notifications:

Add an Error Trigger node
Connect to email or Slack for alerts

Workflow Components
1. OCW API Configuration Form

Access Control: Restrict form URLs to authorized users
Data Validation: All inputs are validated before API submission

404 Error: Invalid bank account ID - verify in OCW
