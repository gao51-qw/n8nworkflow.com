# Voice Cloning Workflow - Zyphra Zonos API

## Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for developers, content creators, and businesses looking to automate high-quality voice synthesis using AI voice cloning technology.

## What problem does this solve?
It automates the process of generating natural-sounding speech from text using a sample voice file, eliminating the need for manual voice recording and providing consistent voice output for applications like audiobooks, virtual assistants, or content localization.

## What this workflow does
The workflow receives text and voice cloning parameters via webhook, reads a sample voice file from your storage, sends the data to Zyphra's Zonos API for voice synthesis, and saves the generated audio file to your specified output location.

## Prerequisites
You'll need:
- API key from Zyphra (obtain from https://playground.zyphra.com/settings/api-keys)
- Account registration at https://playground.zyphra.com  
- Sample voice file stored on accessible disk/cloud storage
- n8n instance running with webhook capabilities

## Setup
1. Configure your Zyphra API key in the "Call Zyphra Clone API" node under Header Parameters (Name: X-API-Key, Value: your-api-key)
2. Ensure your sample voice files are accessible at the paths you'll specify
3. Test the webhook endpoint is accessible

## Supported Audio Formats
The API supports multiple output formats through the `mime_type` parameter:

- **WebM** (default) - `audio/webm`
- **Ogg** - `audio/ogg`
- **WAV** - `audio/wav`
- **MP3** - `audio/mp3` or `audio/mpeg`
- **MP4/AAC** - `audio/mp4` or `audio/aac`
