## ⚙️ Node-by-Node Breakdown

### 1. 🟢 Form Trigger: `On form submission`
- Accepts user input for:
  - `keyword` (e.g. "labubu")
  - `country` (e.g. "us")

### 2. 📦 Set Node: `Global Storage`
- Stores form input into variables (`keyword`, `country`) for use in API requests and logging.

### 3. 🌐 HTTP Request: `SERP Keyword Ranking Checker`
- Sends a `POST` request to the [SERP Keyword Ranking Checker API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/serp-keyword-ranking-checker) with:
  - `keyword`
  - `country`
- Includes headers:
  ```http
  x-rapidapi-host: serp-keyword-ranking-checker.p.rapidapi.com
  x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY
### 4. ⚖️ If Node: Condition Checking

Checks whether the `serpResults` array returned by the API is non-empty.

- ✅ **True Branch**: Proceeds if valid SERP data is available.
- ❌ **False Branch**: Proceeds if no SERP data is returned (e.g., empty result).

---

### 5. ⏳ Wait Node: 5-Second Delay

Adds a 5-second delay before proceeding to Google Sheets insertion.  
This helps control execution pace and ensures API rate limits or spreadsheet latency is handled smoothly.

- Used on **both True and False branches** for consistency.

---

### 6. 📊 Google Sheets (Success Path)

Appends a new row into the selected Google Sheet with:

- `Keyword` – the submitted keyword
- `Country` – selected country code
- `Json data` – full `serpResults` JSON array returned by the API

💡 Ideal for tracking keyword rankings over time or populating live dashboards.

---

### 7. 📊 Google Sheets (Failure Path)

Appends a fallback message into the Google Sheet when no SERP results are found.

- `Keyword` – the submitted keyword
- `Country` – selected country code
- `Json data` – `"No result found. Please try another keyword..."`

🔍 Helps maintain a log of unsuccessful queries for debugging or auditing.
