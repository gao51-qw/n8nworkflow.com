  "description": "### This workflow demonstrates how to automate live information gathering, fact-checking, and trend analysis in response to any chat message - using a powerful AI agent, memory, and a real-time search tool.\n\nUse cases are many: This is perfect for **researchers** needing instant, up-to-date data; **support teams** providing live, accurate answers; **content creators** looking to verify facts or find hot topics; and **analysts** automating regular reports with the freshest information.\n\n## How It Works\n- The workflow is triggered whenever a chat message is received (e.g., a user question, research prompt, or data request).\n- The message is sent to the AI Agent, which follows the following steps:\n    - First, it queries **SerpAPI – Research** to gather the latest real-time information and data from the web.\n    - Next, it checks the **Window Buffer Memory** for any related past interactions or contextual information that may be useful.\n    - Finally, it sends all collected data and context to the **Google Gemini Chat Model**, which analyzes the information and generates a comprehensive, intelligent response.\n- Then, the AI Agent delivers the analyzed, up-to-date answer directly in the chat, combining live data, context, and expert analysis.\n\n## How To Set Up\n- Download and import the workflow into your n8n workspace.\n- Set up API credentials and tool access for the **AI Agent**:\n     - **Google Gemini** (for chat-based intelligence) → connected to Node **Google Gemini Chat Model**.\n     - **SerpAPI** (for real-time web and search results) → connected to Node **SerpAPI - Research**.\n     - **Window Buffer Memory** (for richer, context-aware conversations) → connected to Node Window **Buffer Memory**.\n- Open the chat in n8n and type the topic or trend you want to research.\n- Send the message and wait for the process to complete.\n- Receive the AI-powered research reply in the chat box.\n\n## Requirements\n- An **n8n** instance (self-hosted or cloud).\n- **SerpAPI** credentials for live web search and data gathering.\n- **Window Buffer Memory** configured to provide relevant conversation context in history.\n- **Google Gemini API** access to analyze collected data and generate responses.\n\n## How To Customize\n- **Choose your preferred AI model**: Replace **Google Gemini** with **OpenAI ChatGPT**, or any other chat model as preferred.\n- **Add or change memory**: Replace **Window Buffer Memory** with more advanced memory options for deeper recall.\n- **Connect your preferred chat platform**: Easily swap out the default chat integration for Telegram, Slack, or any other compatible messaging platform to trigger and interact with the workflow.\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you’d like this workflow customized, or if you’re looking to build a tailored AI Agent for your own business - please feel free to reach out to [**Agent Circle**](https://www.agentcircle.ai/).
