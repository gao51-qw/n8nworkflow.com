Stop wasting hours watching long videos. This **n8n workflow** acts as your personal "TL;DW" (Too Long; Didn't Watch) assistant. It automatically pulls YouTube transcripts using Decodo, analyzes them with Google Gemini, and sends a detailed summary straight to your Telegram.

## Why You Need This
* **Save Time:** Turn a 2-hour video into a 5-minute read (95% faster).
* **Don't Miss a Thing:** Captures key points, chapters, tools mentioned, and quotes that you might miss while skimming.
* **Instant Results:** Get a structured summary in Telegram within 30-60 seconds.
* **Multi-Language:** Works with any video language that has YouTube captions.

## Who Is This For?
* **Creators & Marketers:** Spy on competitor strategies and extract tools without watching endless footage.
* **Students:** Turn lecture recordings into instant study notes.
* **Busy Pros:** Digest conference talks and webinars on the go.

## How It Works
1.  **Send Link:** You message a YouTube link to your Telegram bot.
2.  **Scrape:** The bot uses the **[Decodo API](https://decodo.com)** to grab the video transcript and metadata (views, chapters, etc.).
3.  **Analyze:** **Google Gemini** reads the text and writes a structured summary (overview, takeaways, tools).
4.  **Deliver:** You receive the formatted summary in chat.



## Setup Guide

### What You Need
* **[n8n instance](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)** (to run the workflow)
* **Telegram Bot Token** (free via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
* **Decodo Scraper API Key** (for YouTube data - [Get it here](https://dashboard.decodo.com/web-scraping-api/scraper?target=youtube_transcript))
* **Google Gemini API Key** (for the AI - [Get it here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Quick Installation
1.  **Import:** Load the JSON file into your [n8n instance](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin).
2.  **Credentials:** Add your API keys for Telegram, Decodo, and Google Gemini in the n8n credentials section.
3.  **Configure:**
    * In the "Alert Admin" node, set the `chatId` to your Telegram User ID (find it via @userinfobot).
    * (Optional) Change the `languageCode` in the Config node if you want non-English transcripts.
4.  **Test:** Send a YouTube link to your bot. You should see a "Processing..." message followed by your summary!

## Troubleshooting & Tips
* **"Not a YouTube URL":** Make sure you are sending a standard `youtube.com` or `youtu.be` link.
* **No Transcript:** The video must have captions (auto-generated or manual) for this to work.
* **Customization:** You can edit the AI Prompt in the "Generate TLDR" node to change how the summary looks (e.g., "Make it funny" or "Focus on technical details").
