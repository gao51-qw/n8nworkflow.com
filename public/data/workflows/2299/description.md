## Purpose of the workflow
Most scraping workflows get blocked by anti-bot technologies. To avoid this, you can use Scrappey to scrape every website you want.

## How it works:
We use Test Data and make a API Call to the Scrappey service. 
We get the scraped website data back as a result.


## Setup Steps:
- Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the "Scrappey API Call" node with your Scrappey API Key ([Register For Free](https://scrappey.com/?ref=n8n))
- Replace the test data with your production data. You can plug in any type of data connector at this point of your workflow.
