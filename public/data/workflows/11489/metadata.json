  "description": "## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow scrapes **customer reviews from Trustpilot**, analyzes them with AI, and keeps both **Salesforce** and **Google Sheets** automatically updated with customer sentiment insights.\n\nIt uses **Decodo** to reliably extract review content from Trustpilot, processes the text with **OpenAI**, and orchestrates everything using **n8n**.\n\n\n👉 [Deocodo](Decodo)\n\n\n\n## How it works (high level)\n\n1. Reads **Trustpilot review URLs** and **Salesforce Account IDs** from Google Sheets  \n2. Scrapes Trustpilot reviews using **Decodo**  \n3. Uses AI to summarize sentiment, trends, and key positives/negatives  \n4. Generates **two outputs in parallel**\n\n\n## Outputs generated\n\n### 1. Salesforce Account update\nThe workflow updates an **existing Salesforce Account** by writing the AI-generated sentiment summary into a **custom text field** (e.g. `recent_trend_summary__c`).\n\nThis brings external customer feedback directly into Salesforce, allowing teams to work with real market perception inside the CRM.\n\n### 2. Google Sheets analytics dataset\nAt the same time, structured review metrics are stored in Google Sheets:\n- Ratings and sentiment distribution  \n- Top positive and negative keywords  \n- Trend summaries over time  \n\nThis creates a reusable dataset for dashboards and reporting.\n\n\n## How to configure it (general)\n\n- **Google Sheets**: add review URLs + Salesforce Account IDs  \n- **[Decodo](Decodo)**: add your API key to scrape Trustpilot reliably  \n   \n- **OpenAI**: add your API key for AI analysis  \n- **Salesforce**:\n  - Create a custom **Text (255)** field on Account  \n  - Connect Salesforce credentials in n8n  \n  - Only existing Accounts are updated  \n",
