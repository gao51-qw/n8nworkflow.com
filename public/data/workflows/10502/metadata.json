  "description": "Automatically creates complete videos from a text prompt—script, voiceover, stock footage, and subtitles all assembled and ready.\n\n\n## How it works\n\nSend a video topic via webhook (e.g., \"Create a 60-second video about morning exercise\"). The workflow uses OpenAI to generate a structured script with scenes, converts text to natural-sounding speech, searches Pexels for matching B-roll footage, and downloads everything. Finally, it merges audio with video, generates SRT subtitles, and prepares all components for final assembly.\n\nThe workflow handles parallel processing—while generating voiceover, it simultaneously searches and downloads stock footage to save time.\n\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. **Add OpenAI credentials** for script generation and text-to-speech\n2. **Get a free Pexels API key** from pexels.com/api for stock footage access\n3. **Connect Google Drive** for storing the final video output\n4. **Install FFmpeg** (optional) for automated video assembly, or manually combine the components\n5. **Test the webhook** by sending a POST request with your video topic\n\n**Input format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Your video topic here\",\n  \"duration\": 60,\n  \"style\": \"motivational\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## What you get\n\n- ✅ AI-generated script broken into scenes\n- ✅ Professional voiceover audio (MP3)\n- ✅ Downloaded stock footage clips (MP4)\n- ✅ Timed subtitles file (SRT)\n- ✅ All components ready for final editing\n\n**Note:** The final video assembly requires FFmpeg or a video editor. All components are prepared and organized by scene number for easy manual editing if needed.",
