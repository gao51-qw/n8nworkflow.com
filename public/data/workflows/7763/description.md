Automate Outreach Prospect automates finding, enriching, and messaging potential partners (like restaurants, malls, and bars) using Apify Google Maps scraping, Perplexity enrichment, OpenAI LLMs, Google Sheets, Pinecone knowledge, and WhatsApp sending via GOWA. It turns a manual, slow outreach funnel into a repeatable pipeline so your team spends time closing deals instead of copy-pasting contact details.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This workflow uses community nodes for WhatsApp functionality:
- [GOWA](https://github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice)
- [WhatsApp HTTP API](https://waha.devlike.pro)

## 💡 Why Use Automate Outreach Prospect?

- **Faster prospecting:** Scrape up to 150 leads per search (jumlah leads = 150) and queue them for outreach in minutes, cutting manual research time from days to hours.
- **Fixes the busywork:** Automatically enrich missing contact data and only send messages to records with phone numbers, so you stop chasing dead leads.
- **Measurable lift:** Enrich in batches (enrichment batch size = 20), improving outbound readiness and increasing contactable leads per campaign by dozens each run.
- **Better conversions with context:** Use a searchable company knowledge base (Pinecone + LlamaIndex) so replies are handled with context — less robotic, more relevant. Yes, your bot can sound like a helpful human (minus the coffee breath).

## ⚡ Perfect For

- **Sales Ops:** Teams that need to scale partner outreach without hiring a mini-empire of SDRs.
- **Growth Marketers:** People who want repeatable local outreach campaigns (mall, restaurant, bar categories).
- **Small Biz Owners:** Quick way to build partnership lists and automate first outreach without becoming a spreadsheet hermit.

## 🔧 How It Works

### ⏱ Trigger
Manual scrape start or scheduled jobs: Daily Outbound Schedule, Schedule Outbound message, or Knowledge Base Updated Trigger.

### 📎 Process
Apify Google Maps Scraper gathers business listings (location, phone, socials). Results are fetched and saved to Google Sheets (Raw Data). Unenriched records are split and enriched via Perplexity, then saved back.

### 🤖 Smart Logic
OpenAI LLM creates personalized initial messages, and a Reply Handler AI Agent, uses Pinecone/knowledge embeddings to interpret replies and decide next actions (save PICs, request meeting, send proposal).

### 💌 Output
Outbound messages are sent over WhatsApp using GOWA nodes (typing indicators, simulated typing delays, read receipts) and replies are handled & stored; qualified PIC contacts are appended to a Leads sheet.

### 🗂 Storage
Google Sheets is the central datastore (Raw Data, Leads Collected). Knowledge base lives in Google Drive and Pinecone (n8n-recharge, namespace CompanyKnowledgeBased). Conversation memory stored in Postgres/Neon.
