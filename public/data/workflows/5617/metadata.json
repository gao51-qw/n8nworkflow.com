This could be your solution.\n\nThis free Product Description Writer workflow for n8n uses a multi-agent AI system to turn your product list into conversion-focused, SEO-ready copy.

The first drafts a Shopify-optimized title and description, while the second refines it and generates additional SEO-focused copy for Google Merchant Center.\n4.  **Updates Your Spreadsheet**: The final, optimized product titles and descriptions for both Shopify and Google are automatically written back to the original Google Sheet.\n\n### Set up steps\n\nSetting up this workflow takes only a few minutes.
