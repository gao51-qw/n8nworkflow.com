The workflow initiates with a manual trigger (On clicking ‘execute’).\n    2. It reads your Google Sheet file.\n    3. It connects to your Icypeas account.\n    4. It performs an HTTP request to scan the domains/companies.\n\n**Set up steps**\n    1. You will need a formated Google sheet file with company/domain names. \n    2.
