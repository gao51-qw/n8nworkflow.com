  "description": "# 🌤️ Weather Alerts via SMS (OpenWeather + Twilio)\n\nThis workflow checks the **current weather and forecast** every 6 hours using the **OpenWeather API**, and automatically sends an **SMS alert via Twilio** if severe conditions are detected. It’s great for keeping teams, family, or field workers updated about extreme heat, storms, or snow.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Check Every 6 Hours**  \n   - A **Cron node** triggers the workflow every 6 hours.  \n   - Frequency can be adjusted based on your needs.  \n\n2. **Fetch Current Weather & Forecast**  \n   - Calls **OpenWeather API** for both current conditions and the 24-hour forecast.  \n   - Retrieves temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and weather descriptions.  \n\n3. **Analyze Weather Data**  \n   - A **Code node** normalizes the weather data.  \n   - Detects alert conditions such as:  \n     - Extreme heat (≥95°F)  \n     - Extreme cold (≤20°F)  \n     - Severe storms (thunderstorm, tornado)  \n     - Rain or snow  \n     - High winds (≥25 mph)  \n   - Also checks upcoming forecast for severe weather in the next 24 hours.  \n\n4. **Alert Needed?**  \n   - If no severe conditions → workflow stops.  \n   - If alerts exist → proceed to SMS formatting.  \n\n5. **Format SMS Alert**  \n   - Prepares a compact, clear SMS message with:  \n     - Current conditions  \n     - Detected alerts  \n     - Next 3 hours forecast preview  \n   - Example:  \n     ```\n     🌤️ WEATHER ALERT - New York, US\n     NOW: 98°F, clear sky\n     🚨 ALERTS (1): 🔥 EXTREME HEAT: 98°F (feels like 103°F)\n\n     📅 NEXT 3 HOURS:\n     1 PM: 99°F, sunny\n     2 PM: 100°F, sunny\n     3 PM: 100°F, partly cloudy\n     ```  \n\n6. **Send Weather SMS**  \n   - Twilio sends the SMS to configured phone numbers.  \n   - Supports multiple recipients.  \n\n7. **Log Alert Sent**  \n   - Logs the alert type, urgency, and timestamp.  \n   - Useful for auditing and troubleshooting.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Steps\n\n### 1. OpenWeather API\n- Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org).  \n- Get a **free API key** (1000 calls/day).  \n- Update the API key and location (`city` or `lat/long`) in the HTTP Request nodes.  \n\n### 2. Twilio Setup\n- Sign up at [twilio.com](https://twilio.com).  \n- Get your **Account SID & Auth Token**.  \n- Buy a Twilio phone number (≈ $1/month).  \n- Add Twilio credentials in n8n.  \n\n### 3. Recipients\n- In the **Send Weather SMS** node, update phone numbers (format: `+1234567890`).  \n- You can add multiple recipients.  \n\n### 4. Customize Alert Conditions\n- Default alerts: rain, snow, storms, extreme temps, high winds.  \n- Modify the **Analyze Weather Data** node to fine-tune conditions.  \n\n---\n\n## 📲 Example SMS Output\n\n🌤️ WEATHER ALERT - New York, US\nNOW: 35°F, light snow\n🚨 ALERTS (2):\n❄️ SNOW ALERT: light snow\n💨 HIGH WINDS: 28 mph\n\n📅 NEXT 3 HOURS:\n10 AM: 34°F, snow\n11 AM: 33°F, snow\n12 PM: 32°F, overcast\n\n⏰ Alert sent: 08/29/2025, 09:00 AM\n\n\n---\n\n⚡ With this workflow, you’ll always know when bad weather is on the way — keeping you, your team, or your customers safe and informed.",
