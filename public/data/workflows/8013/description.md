## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete solution to automate the process of scraping company and founder data from Y Combinator. 

It systematically extracts valuable information from your target search and organizes it directly into a Google Sheet, building a powerful prospecting list with minimal effort.

## Who's this workflow for?
- Sales Teams & SDRs
- Venture Capitalists 
- Angel Investors
- Market Researchers
- Startup Founders

## How it works
**1. Trigger the Scrape:** You start the workflow manually whenever you want to gather new company data.

**2. Scrape Y Combinator:** An Apify actor automatically visits your specified Y Combinator search URL (e.g., filtered by batch, industry, or region) and scrapes the details of each company listed.

**3. Retrieve Structured Data:** The workflow fetches the neatly structured data from Apify, including company names, descriptions, websites, founder details, and more.

**4. Log to Google Sheets:** All the scraped information is added or updated as new rows in your designated Google Sheet, creating an organized and actionable database.

## Setup Instructions
**1. Apify Configuration:**
- In the Run an Actor node, connect your Apify account.
- Select the Y Combinator Directory Scraper actor.
- In the Custom Body field, replace {YOUR_Y_COMBINATOR_SEARCH_URL} with the actual URL from the Y Combinator website after you've applied your desired filters.
- You can adjust the maxCompanies value to control how many companies are scraped per run.

**2. Google Sheets Configuration:**
- In the Add data to Google Sheet node, connect your Google Sheets account.
- Select the Document (spreadsheet) and Sheet where you want to save the data. Make sure the sheet has the required columns listed in the "Key Requirements" section.

**3. Execute the Workflow:**
- Click the "Execute workflow" button to run the scraper and populate your Google Sheet.
