  "description": "## Who's it for\nThis template is for Customer Success and Sales teams who use HubSpot. It automates the critical handoff from sales to success, ensuring every new customer gets a fast, personalized welcome. It's perfect for anyone looking to standardize their onboarding process, save time on manual tasks, and improve the new customer experience using AI.\n\n## What it does\nThis workflow triggers when a deal's \"Is closed won\" property is set to `True` in HubSpot. It assigns a Customer Success Manager (CSM) by querying an **n8n Data Table to find the 'least busy' CSM (based on a deal count)** and fetches the deal's details to find all associated contacts.\n\nIt then loops to identify the \"Champion\" contact by checking their \"Buying Role\" (`hs_buying_role`). An AI agent (in the `AI: Write Welcome Email` node) generates a personalized welcome email, which is converted to HTML and sent via Gmail. Finally, the workflow updates the Champion's contact record in HubSpot and **updates the CSM's deal count in the Data Table** to keep the logic in sync.\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Create and Populate Data Table:** This template requires an n8n Data Table to manage CSM assignments.\n    * Create a Data Table named `csm_assignments`.\n    * Add two columns: `csm_id` (String) and `deal_count` (Number).\n    * Add one row for each CSM with their HubSpot Owner ID and a starting `deal_count` of `0`.\n2.  **Link Data Table Nodes:** Open the `Get CSM List` and `Increment CSM Deal Count` nodes and select the `csm_assignments` table you just created from the **Table** dropdown.\n3.  **Configure Variables:** In the `Configure Template Variables` node, you must set your sender info (`company_name`, `sender_name`, and `sender_email`).\n4.  **Customize AI Prompt:** In the `AI: Write Welcome Email` node, update the placeholder `[Link to Your Video]` and `[Link to Your Help Doc]` links with your own URLs.\n5.  **Check HubSpot Property:** This workflow assumes you use the \"Buying Role\" (`hs_buying_role`) contact property to identify your \"Champion\". If you use a different property, you must update the `HubSpot: Get Contact Details` and `If Role is 'Champion'` nodes.\n\n## Requirements\n* Access to **n8n Data Tables**.\n* **HubSpot (Developer API):** A credential for the `Trigger: Deal Is 'Closed Won'` node.\n* **HubSpot (OAuth2):** A credential for all other HubSpot nodes (`Get Deal Details`, `Get Contact Details`, `Assign Contact Owner`).\n* **AI Credentials:** (e.g., OpenAI) Credentials for the `AI Model` node (the node connected to `AI: Write Welcome Email`).\n* **Email Credentials:** (e.g., Gmail) Credentials for the `Gmail: Send Welcome Email` node.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\nYou can easily customize this workflow to send different emails based on deal properties. Add an `If` node after the `HubSpot: Get Deal Details` node to check for the deal's value, product line, or region.\n\nBased on these properties, you can route the flow to different `AI: Write Welcome Email` nodes with unique prompts. For example, you could **check the contact's 'industry' or 'company size' to send them links to different, more relevant 'Getting Started' videos and documentation.**",
