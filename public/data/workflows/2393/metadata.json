  "description": "## Who this is for\nThis template is for everyone that wants to download their n8n Cloud invoices automatically as a PDF instead of downloading them manually.\n## How it works\nThis workflow checks your Gmail inbox for new n8n invoice emails from n8n's payment provider Paddle. Once it finds something, it converts the URL into a PDF using pdflayer and saves it in Google Drive.\n## Setup\n1. Setup your **Gmail** and **Google Drive** credentials\n1. Create a free account at https://pdflayer.com/\n2. Insert your **pdflayer** API key into the `Setup` node\n3. Insert the URL to the wanted drive folder into the setup node (make sure to remove everything after the `?`)\n## How to adjust it to your need\nInstead of saving the PDF in Google drive, you could also save it in your local system, any other storage provider or send the PDF automatically to the right person in your company.",
