  "description": "Create engaging, structured threads on Bluesky with **precise control over post timing and visibility**.\n\nThis workflow helps content creators and social media managers schedule and publish threaded posts that maintain **proper connections and formatting**, ensuring your content appears exactly as intended.\n\n## How it works\n* Creates an **initial visible post** that starts your thread\n* Adds a series of **hidden reply posts** that form the body of your thread\n* Maintains proper **parent-child relationships** between posts to ensure correct threading\n* Enforces **timing delays** between posts to prevent rate limiting\n* Concludes with **two visible posts** at the end of your thread\n\nThe result is a clean, professional-looking thread where **only the first and last two posts are immediately visible** to your followers, encouraging engagement while maintaining a clean profile view.\n\n## Set up steps (10-30 minutes)\n1. Create a Bluesky account\n2. Enter your **Bluesky handle** and **app password** in the \"Set Bluesky Credentials\" node\n3. Customize the post text in the Code nodes to match your content:\n   - Initial visible post\n   - Hidden reply posts\n   - Final visible posts\n4. Adjust the scheduling in the \"Run Daily at 9 AM\" node to match your preferred posting time\n\n## Suggested enhancements\n* Add error handling with retry logic for API failures\n* Add input validation for post length and credential format\n* Include error notifications via email or Slack\n* Add data persistence to track successful posts and resume failed threads\n* Make timing delays configurable with exponential backoff\n* Add monitoring for rate limits and API quotas\n\n---\n\n### For Social Media Managers who want:\n* Control over post visibility and timing\n* Automated posting of long-form content\n* Professional-looking content presentation",
