## 📖 Usage Guide

### Google Sheet Structure
Your Google Sheet should have the following columns to ensure the workflow functions correctly:

* **Product URL** (Text): The direct URL to the Google Shopping product page. This is the primary identifier for the product.
* **Product Name** (Text): The name of the product. This will be automatically populated or updated by the workflow.
* **Old Price** (Number/Currency): The price of the product from the previous check. This column is crucial for price comparison.
* **New Price** (Number/Currency): The most recently scraped price of the product.
* **Ratings** (Number): The star rating of the product.
* **Reviews** (Number): The total number of reviews for the product.
* **Timestamp** (Datetime): The date and time when the price check was performed.

### Adding Products
* Add Google Shopping URLs to your Google Sheet.
* The workflow will fetch product details and track prices.
* Historical price data builds over time.

### Understanding Price Alerts
The default setting for this workflow is to send an email alert when the **new price equals the old price**. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's useful for specific scenarios, such as:

* **Monitoring stable pricing:** If you are tracking a product and want to be notified when its price has remained consistent over time, indicating a potential stable buying opportunity or a benchmark.
* **Verifying data consistency:** To confirm that the scraping process is working correctly and consistently retrieving the same price when no changes are expected.

You can easily **customize the alert logic** to trigger on different conditions as described below.

### Customizing Alert Logic
* **Price drops:** `new_price &lt; old_price`
* **Significant drops:** `new_price &lt; (old_price * 0.9)` (e.g., price dropped by more than 10%)
* **Price increases:** `new_price &gt; old_price`
* **Any change:** `new_price != old_price`

### Reading the Results
* Real-time pricing data
* Historical tracking
* Product metadata
* Timestamps for each check
