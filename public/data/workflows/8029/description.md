# 🌟 Send Daily Motivational Quote to Slack

This workflow automatically posts an inspiring motivational quote to your Slack channel every morning at **8 AM**. It uses the free [ZenQuotes.io](https://zenquotes.io) API (no API key required) to fetch quotes and delivers them to your team in Slack.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Trigger at 8 AM**  
   A **Cron node** runs daily at **8 AM EST** (America/New_York timezone by default).

2. **Fetch a Random Quote**  
   The workflow sends an **HTTP Request** to [ZenQuotes.io API](https://zenquotes.io/api/random) to retrieve a motivational quote.

3. **Format the Message**  
   A **Code node** structures the quote into a Slack-friendly message, adding styling, emojis, and the author’s name.

4. **Post to Slack**  
   Finally, the **Slack node** sends the motivational message to your chosen Slack channel (default: `#general`).
