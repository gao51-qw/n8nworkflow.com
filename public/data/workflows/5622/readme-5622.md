### How It Works

This n8n workflow transforms structured company data from a Google Sheet into a fully formatted, investor-grade SWOT report in both HTML and PDF formats. Here’s the process in a few high-level steps:

1. **Load Data**: Pulls company information from the "Company Info Input" tab in the "SWOT Analysis" Google Sheet.
2. **AI Analysis**: Uses AI (via OpenAI or DeepSeek) to categorize data into Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and generates detailed narrative sections for each.
3. **Create Report Sections**: Produces a strategic introduction, conclusion, table of contents, and title page using AI.
4. **Format and Combine**: Converts all sections into styled HTML and merges them into a single document.
5. **Generate PDF**: Converts the HTML into a polished, multi-page PDF using APITemplate.io.
6. **Save and Share**: Saves the report back to Google Sheets and emails the PDF to a specified recipient.

The result is a professional, investor-ready SWOT report with minimal manual effort, ready for sharing or review.
