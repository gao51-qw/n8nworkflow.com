### How The Workflow Operates

1.  **Initiate with a Form:** The process begins when you submit a script, a desired voice, and language through a simple **n8n Form Trigger**.
2.  **Synthesize Speech:** The workflow sends the text to **Google's Text-to-Speech API**, which generates the audio and returns it as a base64 encoded file.
3.  **Process and Upload:** The data is converted into a binary audio file and uploaded directly to a specified folder in your **Google Drive**.
4.  **Enrich Metadata:** The workflow then retrieves the audio file's duration using the `fal.ai` ffmpeg API, adding valuable metadata.
5.  **Log Everything:** Finally, it creates a new record in your **Airtable** base, storing the asset name, description (your script), content type, file URLs from Google Drive, and the audio duration for perfect organization.
