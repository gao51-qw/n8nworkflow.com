Instagram AI Beauty Assistant with Booking & Calendar Automation

💄 Smart Instagram AI Assistant for Beauty & Cosmetics Brands

Help customers instantly on Instagram using a smart AI assistant designed specifically for beauty, skincare, makeup, and nail businesses.
This workflow answers product questions using FAQs only, handles voice messages, and schedules consultation bookings with timezone-safe Google Calendar reservations and automatic confirmation emails.

Perfect for salons, cosmetic brands, clinics, and Instagram-first businesses.

⚙️ How it works

Customers send messages or voice notes via Instagram DM

The AI detects whether the message is:

A product or policy question

A voice message (which gets transcribed)

A request to book a consultation or meeting

Product questions are answered only using your FAQs (no hallucinations)

Booking requests:

Get grounded using the current date and time

Check available slots before booking

Collect customer details (name, phone, email, topic)

Confirmed bookings are created in Google Calendar with rich event summaries

A confirmation email is sent automatically to the customer

🧰 Setup steps

Connect your Instagram webhook or messaging API

Connect your OpenAI account (chat + voice transcription)

Connect Google Calendar for reservations

Connect Gmail for confirmation emails

Customize your FAQs and availability rules

Set your business timezone

That’s it — your Instagram assistant is ready to work 24/7 ✨
