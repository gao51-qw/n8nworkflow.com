# Generate and send MadKudu Account Brief into Outreach


This workflow generates an account brief tailored to your company using MadKudu MCP and OpenAI and syncs it to a custom field in Outreach. 
Its for Sales who want to give reps rich account context right inside Outreach, and draft Outreach email with Outreach Revenue Agent based on MadKudu account brief.

## ✨ Who it's for
- RevOps or GTM teams using MadKudu + Salesforce + Outreach

Sales teams needing dynamic, AI-generated context for target accounts

## 🔧 How it works
#### 1. Select Accounts:
- Use a Salesforce node to define which accounts to brief.
- Filter logic can be updated to match ICP or scoring rules (e.g., MadKudu Fit + LTB).

#### 2. Generate Brief with MadKudu MCP & AI
- MadKudu MCP provides the account brief instructions, research online for company recent news and provides structured account context from your integrations connected to MadKudu + external signals (firmographics, past opportunities, active contacts, job openings...)

- The AI agent (OpenAI model) turns this into a readable account brief.

#### 3. Send to Outreach
- Match account in Outreach via domain.
- Update a custom field (e.g., custom49) with the brief text.

## 📋 How to set up
1. Connect your Salesforce account
Used to pull accounts that need a brief.

2. Set your OpenAI credentials

3. Create a n8n **[Variable](https://docs.n8n.io/code/variables/)** to store your **[MadKudu API key](https://developers.madkudu.com/getting-started/quickstart)** named **madkudu_api_key** used for the MadKudu MCP tool
The AI Agent pulls the account brief instructions and all the context necessary to generate the briefs. 

3. Create an Oauth2 API credential to connect your Outreach account
