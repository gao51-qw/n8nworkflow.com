  "description": "# Generate and send MadKudu Account Brief into Outreach\n\n\nThis workflow generates an account brief tailored to your company using MadKudu MCP and OpenAI and syncs it to a custom field in Outreach. \nIts for Sales who want to give reps rich account context right inside Outreach, and draft Outreach email with Outreach Revenue Agent based on MadKudu account brief.\n\n## ✨ Who it's for\n- RevOps or GTM teams using MadKudu + Salesforce + Outreach\n\nSales teams needing dynamic, AI-generated context for target accounts\n\n## 🔧 How it works\n#### 1. Select Accounts:\n- Use a Salesforce node to define which accounts to brief.\n- Filter logic can be updated to match ICP or scoring rules (e.g., MadKudu Fit + LTB).\n\n#### 2. Generate Brief with MadKudu MCP & AI\n- MadKudu MCP provides the account brief instructions, research online for company recent news and provides structured account context from your integrations connected to MadKudu + external signals (firmographics, past opportunities, active contacts, job openings...)\n\n- The AI agent (OpenAI model) turns this into a readable account brief.\n\n#### 3.

Connect your Salesforce account\nUsed to pull accounts that need a brief.\n\n2. Set your OpenAI credentials\nRequired for the AI Agent to generate the brief.\n\n3. Create a n8n **[Variable](https://docs.n8n.io/code/variables/)** to store your **[MadKudu API key](https://developers.madkudu.com/getting-started/quickstart)** named **madkudu_api_key** used for the MadKudu MCP tool\nThe AI Agent pulls the account brief instructions and all the context necessary to generate the briefs. \n\n3. Create an Oauth2 API credential to connect your Outreach account\nUsed to sync to brief to Outreach.\n\n4. Customize the Salesforce filter\nIn the “Get accounts” node, define which accounts should get a brief (e.g. Fit &gt; 90).\n\n5. Map your Outreach custom field\nUpdate the JSON Body request with your actual custom field ID (e.g. custom49).\n\n#### 🔑 How to connect Outreach\n1. In n8n, add a new Oauth2 API credential and copy the callback URL \n2. Now go to **[Outreach developer portal](https://developers.outreach.io/apps/)**\n2. Click “Add” to create a new app \n3. In **Feature selection** add **Outreach API (OAuth)** \n4. In **API Access (Oauth)** set the redirect URI to the n8n callback \n5. Select the following scopes  accounts.read, accounts.write \n6. Save in Outreach\n7. Now enter the Outreach **Application ID** into n8n **Client Id** and the Outreach **Application Secret** into n8n **Client secret**\n8.
