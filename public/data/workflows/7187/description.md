# Automate Content Publishing to TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook via Blotato

---

### 🎯 Who is this for?

This workflow is perfect for:
- Content creators who post daily to multiple platforms  
- Marketing teams managing brand presence across channels  
- Solo entrepreneurs and social media managers looking to scale their output  
- Anyone tired of uploading content manually across apps  

---

### 💡 What problem is this solving?

Managing content across platforms is time-consuming.  
You need to:
- Track posts per platform  
- Upload videos manually  
- Adapt captions and posting time  
- Avoid repetitive mistakes

This workflow solves all of that by centralizing everything in one place (Google Sheets) and automating it via Blotato.

### ⚙️ What this workflow does

Every hour, this workflow will:
1. Check your Google Sheet for any post marked as `"TO GO"`  
2. Select one item at a time (avoids spam and overposting)  
3. Extract media from a shared Google Drive link  
4. Upload the media to **Blotato**  
5. Publish it automatically to:
   - TikTok  
   - YouTube Shorts  
   - Instagram  
   - Facebook  
6. Update the post status in your Sheet to `"Posted"`
