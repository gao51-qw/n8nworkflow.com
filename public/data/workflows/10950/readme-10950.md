# Automate LINE & Google account linking with OAuth2 authentication

> # LINE x Google Account Linking Workflow

This workflow automates the process of linking a new user on your LINE Official Account to their Google Account. When a user adds your LINE account as a friend, this workflow automatically sends them a message with a unique authentication link. After the user approves the connection, their Google profile information is fetched, and a confirmation message is sent, completing the loop.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **An n8n instance:** Either on n8n.cloud or a self-hosted environment.
*   **A LINE Developers Account:**
    *   A Messaging API channel.
    *   Your Channel Access Token (long-lived).
*   **A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:**
    *   A configured OAuth consent screen.
    *   An OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to configure the workflow.

### Step 1: Configure LINE Developers Console

1.  Log in to the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).
2.  Navigate to your provider and select your **Messaging API channel**.
3.  Go to the **Messaging API** tab.
4.  Issue a **Channel access token (long-lived)** and copy the value.
5.  In the **Webhook URL** field, paste the Test URL from the `LINE Webhook` node in your n8n workflow.
6.  Enable **Use webhook**.

### Step 2: Configure Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

1.  Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select your project.
2.  Navigate to **APIs & Services** &gt; **OAuth consent screen**. Configure it if you haven't already, ensuring you add your own Google account as a test user.
3.  Go to **APIs & Services** &gt; **Credentials**.
4.  Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
5.  For **Application type**, choose **Web application**.
6.  Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **+ ADD URI** and paste the Test URL from the `Google Auth Callback` node in your n8n workflow.
7.  Click **Create**. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Step 3: Configure the n8n Workflow

Import the workflow JSON into your n8n canvas and follow these steps to set it up.

#### 1. Configure n8n Credentials

First, set up the credentials that the HTTP Request nodes will use.

*   **For the LINE Messaging API:**
    1.  In n8n, go to **Credentials** &gt; **Add credential**.
    2.  Search for and select **Header Auth**.
    3.  Set `Name` to `Authorization`.
    4.  Set `Value` to `Bearer YOUR_LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (replace with the token from Step 1).
    5.  Save the credential with a memorable name like "LINE Messaging API Auth".

*   **For the Google API (Dynamic Token):**
    1.  Create another **Header Auth** credential.
    2.  Set `Name` to `Authorization`.
    3.  For `Value`, enter a placeholder like `Bearer dummy_token`. This will be replaced dynamically by the workflow.
    4.  Save the credential with a name like "Google API Dynamic Token".

#### 2. Update Node Parameters

Now, update the parameters in the following nodes:

*   **`Create Google Auth URL` node:**
    *   In the `value` field, replace `YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL_FOR_GOOGLE` with the webhook URL of the `Google Auth Callback` node.
    *   Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with the Client ID from GCP (Step 2).

*   **`Get Google Access Token` node:**
    *   In the `jsonBody` field, replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL_FOR_GOOGLE` with your actual GCP credentials and callback URL.

*   **`Get Google User Info` node:**
    *   For **Authentication**, select `Header Auth`.
    *   For **Credential for Header Auth**, choose the "Google API Dynamic Token" credential you created.
    *   **Important:** Click **Add Option** &gt; **Header To Append**. Set the `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to the following expression to use the token from the previous step: `Bearer {{ $node["Get Google Access Token"].json["access_token"] }}`.

*   **`Send Auth Link to LINE` & `Send Completion Message to LINE` nodes:**
    *   For **Credential for Header Auth**, choose the "LINE Messaging API Auth" credential.

*   **`Redirect to LINE OA` node:**
    *   In the `redirectURL` parameter, replace `YOUR_LINE_OFFICIAL_ACCOUNT_ID` with your LINE OA's ID (e.g., `@123abcde`).

### Step 4: Activate and Test

1.  Save the workflow by clicking the **Save** button.
2.  **Activate** the workflow using the toggle in the top-right corner.
3.  On your phone, add your LINE Official Account as a friend. You should receive a message with a link.
4.  Follow the link to authorize with your Google account. After successful authorization, you should receive a completion message in LINE and be redirected.

&gt; **Note:** When you are ready for production, remember to replace the "Test" webhook URLs in the LINE and GCP consoles with the "Production" URLs from the n8n webhook nodes.
