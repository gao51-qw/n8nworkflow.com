Manual lead qualification is slow, inconsistent, and expensive. Sales teams waste hours on unqualified leads while hot prospects go cold. This workflow:

- Normalizes data from various field naming conventions

### 2. Company Enrichment via Apify
- Uses Google Search to find company's LinkedIn profile
- Scrapes LinkedIn for industry, size, description, specialties, and more

- Assigns tier: Hot (80+), Warm (60-79), Cold (40-59), Disqualified (&lt;40)
- Identifies buyer persona (Decision Maker, Influencer, Champion, etc.)
- Generates personalized talking points and risk factors

### 4. Intelligent Routing & Actions
- **Hot Leads**: Instant Slack alert + AI-generated personalized email + HubSpot contact
