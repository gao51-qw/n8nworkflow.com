# AppSheet Intelligent Query Orchestrator  

A **friendly, practical tool** that makes working with AppSheet data simpler and more efficient. This workflow is your go-to helper for building **precise queries** without getting lost in a sea of different tables.  

## Background  
Previously, I built a **community node** to enable this functionality: [Appsheet n8n Community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-rifad-appsheet?activeTab=readme)

## How It Works  

This workflow **fetches the most up-to-date schema and taxonomy** from your Google Sheet mirror and constructs a custom query using key components:  

- **TableName**: Specifies exactly which table to query.  
- **Selector**: Uses powerful functions like `SELECT()`, `FILTER()`, and `CONTAINS()` to filter data with precision.  
- **Columns Required**: Extracts only the essential fields, keeping the payload **lean and focused**.  
- **Natural Language Search Query**: Provides a **clear, descriptive context** that helps refine and re-rank results.  

## Real-World Use Cases  

This orchestrator is designed for **various industries**, making data retrieval effortless:  

### 📦 Supply Chain & Manufacturing  
- Find the right product based on specific attributes.  
- Locate suppliers that meet certain **quality or pricing criteria**.
