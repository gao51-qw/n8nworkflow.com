  "title": "Voice AI customer support for WooCommerce using VAPI, GPT-4o & Gemini with RAG",
  "description": "This workflow integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** with a **post-sales AI agent for WooCommerce**. It combines vector-based search (Qdrant + OpenAI embeddings) with LLMs (Google Gemini and GPT-4o-mini) to provide accurate and contextual responses.\n\nBoth systems are connected to **VAPI webhooks**, making the workflow usable in a **voice AI assistant** via **Twilio** phone numbers.\n\nThe workflow receives JSON payloads from VAPI via webhooks, processes the request through the appropriate chain (Agent or RAG), and sends a structured response back to VAPI to be read out to the user.\n\n---\n\n### Advantages\n\n* ✅ **Unified AI Support System**: Combines knowledge retrieval (RAG) with transactional support (WooCommerce).\n* ✅ **Data Privacy & Security**: Enforces strict email/order verification before sharing information.\n* ✅ **Multi-Model Power**: Leverages both **Google Gemini** and **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** for optimal responses.\n* ✅ **Scalable Knowledge Base**: Qdrant vector database ensures fast and accurate context retrieval.\n* ✅ **Customer Satisfaction**: Provides real-time answers about orders, tracking, and store policies.\n* ✅ **Flexible Integration**: Easily connects with VAPI for **voice assistants** and **phone-based customer support**.\n* ✅ **Reusable Components**: The RAG part can be extended for FAQs, while the post-sales agent can scale with more WooCommerce tools.\n\n---\n\n### How it Works\n\nIt has two main components:\n\n1. **RAG System (Knowledge Retrieval & Q\\&A)**\n\n   * Uses **OpenAI embeddings** to store documents in **Qdrant**.\n   * Retrieves relevant context with a **Vector Store Retriever**.\n   * Sends the information to a **Question & Answer Chain** powered by **Google Gemini**.\n   * Returns precise, context-based answers to user queries via webhook.\n\n2. **Post-Sales Customer Support Agent**\n\n   * Acts as a **WooCommerce virtual assistant** to:\n\n     * Retrieve customer orders (`get_order`, `get_orders`).\n     * Get user profiles (`get_user`).\n     * Provide **shipment tracking** (`get_tracking`) using YITH WooCommerce Order Tracking plugin.\n   * Enforces **strict verification rules**: customer email must match the order before disclosing details.\n   * Communicates professionally, providing clear and secure customer support.\n   * Integrates with **GPT-4o-mini** for natural conversation flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo implement this workflow, follow these three main steps:\n\n**1. Infrastructure & Credentials Setup in n8n:**\n*   Ensure all required nodes have their credentials configured:\n    *   **OpenAI API Key:** For the `GPT 4o-mini` and `Embeddings OpenAI` nodes.\n    *   **Google Gemini API Key:** For the `Google Gemini Chat Model` node.\n    *   **Qdrant Connection Details:** For the `Qdrant Vector Store1` node (points to a Hetzner server).\n    *   **WooCommerce API Keys:** For the `get_order`, `get_orders`, and `get_user` nodes (for `magnanigioielli.com`).\n    *   **WordPress HTTP Auth Credentials:** For the `Get tracking` node in the sub-workflow.\n*   **Pre-populate the Vector Database:** The RAG system requires a pre-filled Qdrant collection with your store's knowledge base (e.g., policy documents, product info). The \"Sticky Note2\" provides a link to a guide on building this RAG system.\n\n**2. Workflow Activation in n8n:**\n*   Save this JSON workflow in your n8n instance.\n*   **Activate the workflow.** This is crucial, as n8n only listens for webhook triggers when the workflow is active.\n*   Note the unique public webhook URLs generated for the `Webhook` (post-sales agent) and `rag` (RAG system) nodes. You will need these URLs for the next step.\n\n**3. VAPI Configuration:**\n*   **Create Two API Tools in VAPI:**\n    *   **Tool 1 (Post-Sales):** Create an \"API Request\" tool. Connect it to the n8n `Webhook` URL. Configure the request body to send parameters `email` and `n_order` based on the conversation with the user.\n    *   **Tool 2 (RAG):** Create another \"API Request\" tool. Connect it to the n8n `rag` webhook URL. Configure the request body to send a `search` parameter containing the user's query.\n*   **Build the Assistant:** Create a new assistant in VAPI. Write a system prompt that instructs the AI on when to use each of the two tools you created. In the \"Tools\" tab, add both tools.\n*   **Go Live:** Add a phone number (e.g., from Twilio) to your VAPI assistant and set it to \"Inbound\" to receive customer calls.\n\n---\n\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
