  "description": "This workflow automates **real-time student tracking** using **iOS Shortcuts and geolocation data**, notifying both **teachers and parents** based on geofenced logic.\n\n\n## 🎯 What This Workflow Does\n\n* Receives student **location updates via webhook** (iOS Shortcuts)\n* Detects if the student has **arrived at school**\n* Logs arrival data to Google Sheets\n* **Sends email alerts** to teacher and/or parent based on location\n\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Steps\n\n| Step                        | Description                                              |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Location Update Webhook** | Triggered via iOS Shortcut when student location updates |\n| **Process Location Data**   | Extracts coordinates and metadata                        |\n| **Student Arrived?**        | Checks if student entered school zone                    |\n| **Log School Arrival**      | Adds arrival data to Google Sheet                        |\n| **At School?**              | Double-checks geofence condition before notifying        |\n| **Notify Teacher**          | Sends email if student is confirmed at school            |\n| **Notify Parent**           | Sends email to parent (can vary based on geofence logic) |\n| **Success Response**        | Returns a 200 response to the triggering device          |\n\n\n## 🧠 How the Logic Works\n\n1. The student’s phone runs a shortcut when near school.\n2. Sends coordinates to webhook.\n3. Workflow compares coordinates with predefined geofence (e.g., radius around school).\n4. If inside school zone:\n   * Log arrival\n   * Notify teacher and/or parent\n5. Else:\n   * Optionally notify parent only\n\n\n## 📱 iOS Shortcut Sample (Trigger Setup)\n\n* **Automation Trigger**: Arrive at Location (e.g., School)\n* **Action**: Run Shortcut → Make Web Request (POST)\n\n**POST URL:**\n\n```\nhttps://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/location-update\n```\n\n**Body Example:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"student_id\": \"STU042\",\n  \"student_name\": \"Anaya Joshi\",\n  \"lat\": 19.0760,\n  \"lng\": 72.8777,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-08-06T08:05:00\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## 📊 Google Sheets Logging\n\n| Student ID | Name        | Date       | Time  | Status  |\n| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ------- |\n| STU042     | Anaya Joshi | 2025-08-06 | 08:05 | Arrived |\n\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Requirements\n\n* **n8n Instance** with webhook support\n* **Google Sheet** with appropriate columns\n* **iOS Shortcut** setup on student device\n* **Teacher and Parent Email Addresses** configured in workflow",
