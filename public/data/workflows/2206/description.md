### Use case

This workflow enables a Telegram bot that can:

- Accept speech input in one of 55 supported languages
- Automatically detect the language spoken and translate the speech to another language 
- Responds back with the translated speech output.

This allows users to communicate across language barriers by simply speaking to the bot, which will handle the translation seamlessly.

### How does it work?

#### Translation
In the translation step the workflow converts the user's speech input to text and detects the language of the input text. 

If it's English, it will translate to French. If it's French, it will translate to English.

To change the default translation languages, you can update the prompt in the AI node.

#### Output
In the output step, we provide the translated text output back to the user and speech output is generated in the translated language.
