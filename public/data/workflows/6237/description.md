# WhatsApp Bulk Message Broadcast via Google Sheets (n8n Workflow)

## Use Case

This workflow enables automated bulk WhatsApp message broadcasting using the WhatsApp Business Cloud API. It pulls recipient and message data from a Google Sheet, sends templated messages (optionally with image headers), and updates the sheet with the message status. It is ideal for marketing teams, support agents, and businesses handling high-volume outreach.

## Who Is This For?

- Businesses conducting WhatsApp marketing or outreach campaigns  
- Customer support or notification teams  
- Administrators seeking an automated, no-code message distribution system using Google Sheets  

---

## What This Workflow Does

- Triggers automatically every minute to scan for pending messages  
- Fetches unsent entries from a Google Sheet  
- Limits the number of messages processed per execution to comply with API usage guidelines  
- Sanitizes WhatsApp numbers for proper formatting  
- Sends messages using a pre-approved WhatsApp template (text and optional image)  
- Marks the row as "Sent" in the sheet upon successful delivery

## Workflow Breakdown (Node by Node)

### 1. Trigger Every 5 Minutes  
Initiates the workflow every minute using a scheduled trigger to continuously monitor pending rows.

### 2. Fetch All Pending Queries for Messaging  
Reads rows from a Google Sheet where the `Status` column is empty, indicating they haven’t been processed yet.

### 3. Limit  
Restricts processing to 2 rows per execution to manage API throughput.

### 4. Loop Over Items  
Uses `SplitInBatches` to iterate through each row individually.

### 5. Clean WhatsApp Number  
A code node that strips non-numeric characters from the `WhatsApp No` field, ensuring the format is valid for the API.

### 6. Send Message to 300 Phone No  
Sends a WhatsApp message using the WhatsApp Cloud API and a pre-approved template.  
Template includes:
- An image from the `Image URL` column (as header, optional)  
- Dynamic variables for the recipient's `Name` and `Message` fields  

Template variables must be pre-defined and approved in the Meta Developer Portal, such as `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`.

### 7. Change State of Rows in Sent1  
Updates the `Status` column to `Sent` for each successfully processed row using the row number as a reference.

## Google Sheet Format

Structure your Google Sheet as shown below:

| WhatsApp No  | Name       | Message                  | Image URL          | Status |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| +8801XXXXXXX | John Doe   | Hello, your order shipped | https://.../img.jpg |        |

Leave the `Status` column empty for rows that need to be processed.

---

## Customization Options

- Update the `Limit` node to control how many rows are processed in each run  
- Adjust the trigger schedule (e.g., change to every 5 minutes)  
- Replace the message template ID with your own custom-approved one from Meta  
- Add error-handling logic (e.g., `IF` or `Try/Catch` nodes) to log failures or set `Status = Failed`
