**Automate your cold calling process with AI-powered conversation handling, smart scheduling, and comprehensive call tracking**

## How it works

This comprehensive cold calling system automates your entire outbound calling workflow in 4 high-level steps:

1. **Automated Dialing** - System automatically calls prospects from your Airtable database at scheduled intervals
2. **AI Conversation Handling** - Advanced AI assistant conducts natural conversations, handles objections, and books appointments
3. **Smart Call Processing** - Real-time call analysis determines outcomes (answered, voicemail, busy) and updates prospect status
4. **Intelligent Follow-up** - Automatically schedules callbacks, creates calendar appointments, and maintains detailed call records

## Key Features

- **Automated Prospect Management** - Pulls contacts from Airtable and manages call status
- **AI-Powered Conversations** - Uses VAPI.ai for natural, human-like phone interactions
- **Research Integration** - AI can research prospects using Wikipedia, Hacker News, and web search
