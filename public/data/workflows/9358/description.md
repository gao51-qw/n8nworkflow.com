## This n8n is a daily analytics automation that calculates which lead sources generate actual revenue, not just leads. Provides ROI data, conversion rates, and budget allocation recommendations.

Use Case: automates marketing ROI tracking by linking closed deals to their lead sources in Airtable, calculating revenue and ROI per channel, and sending daily insights to Slack.

## **What It Does**

- Runs nightly to analyze closed deals from last 30 days
- Matches deals to their original lead sources
- Calculates total revenue per source
- Computes ROI (revenue vs. cost per lead)
- Determines conversion rates by source
- Updates Lead Sources table with metrics
- Sends weekly reports to team

## How It Works
**Step 1: Schedule Trigger**
Runs daily at midnight

**Step 2: Fetch Closed Won Deals**
Gets all deals where:
- Stage = "Closed Won"
- Actual Close Date in last 30 days

**Step 3: Fetch Lead Sources**
Gets cost and lead count data from Lead Sources table

**Step 4: Calculate ROI (JavaScript)**
For each source:

- Total revenue = Sum of all deals from that source
- Total cost = Cost per lead × Total leads
- ROI = ((Revenue - Cost) / Cost) × 100
- Conversion rate = Deals closed / Total leads × 100
- Average deal size = Revenue / Deal count

**Step 5: Update Lead Sources**
Writes calculated metrics back to Airtable

**Step 6: Send Report**
Slack message with top 3 performing sources
