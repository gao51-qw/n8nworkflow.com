# Shopify AI Automation
# Image-to-Product CSV Bulk Upload Automation

This **Shopify AI automation** is an advanced n8n-powered workflow that converts raw product images into a **Shopify-ready product CSV**.  
It uses AI image analysis, Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Shopify APIs to fully automate product onboarding — from images to structured ecommerce data.

Built for scalable **ecommerce automation**, this workflow is especially effective for image-first catalogs such as jewelry, fashion, and accessories.

## 🧩 Workflow Preparation

Before running the workflow:

1. Upload all product images to **Google Drive**
2. Name images using the format:
&lt;SKU&gt;&lt;ColorCode&gt;
