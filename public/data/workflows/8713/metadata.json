  "title": "Ticket triage for Jira Service Management with Gemini AI audit and guidance",
  "description": "An extendable triage workflow that classifies severity, sets components, and posts actionable guidance for support engineers using **n8n + Gemini + Cache Augmented Generation (CAG)**. Designed for **Jira Service Management**, but easily adaptable to **Zendesk**, **Freshdesk**, or **ServiceNow**.  \n\n\n---\n\n## Description  \nSupport teams loose valuable time when tickets are misclassified: wrong severity, missing components, unclear scope. Engineers end up re-routing issues and chasing missing info instead of solving real problems.  \n\nThis workflow automates triage by combining **domain rules** with **AI-driven classification and guidance**, so engineers receive **better-prepared tickets**.  \n\nIt includes:  \n✅ Real-time ticket capture via webhook  \n✅ AI triage for **severity** and **component**  \n✅ **CAG-powered guidance**: 3 next steps + missing info  \n✅ Internal **audit comment** with justifications & confidence  \n✅ Structured **metrics** for reporting  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works  \nThis workflow runs in **4 stages**:  \n\n📥 **Entry & Setup**  \n- Webhook triggers on ticket creation  \n- Loads domain rules (priority policy, components, guidance templates)  \n- Sets confidence threshold & triage label  \n\n🧠 **AI Analysis (Gemini + CAG)**  \n- Builds structured payload with ticket + domain context  \n- Gemini proposes severity, component, guidance, missing info  \n- Output normalized for safe automation (valid JSON, conservative confidence)  \n\n🤖 **Update & Audit**  \n- Updates fields (priority, component, labels) if confidence ≥ threshold  \n- Posts **internal audit comment** with:  \n  - 3 next steps  \n  - Missing info to request  \n  - Justifications + confidence  \n\n📊 **Metrics**  \n- Captures applied changes, confidence scores, and API statuses  \n- Enables reliability tracking & continuous improvement  \n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Key Features  \n- **CAG-powered guidance** → lightning-fast, context-rich next steps  \n- **Explainable automation** → transparent audit comments for every decision  \n- **Domain-driven rules** → adaptable to any product or support domain  \n- **Portable** → swap JSM with **Zendesk, Freshdesk, ServiceNow** via HTTP nodes  \n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Required Credentials\n\n| Tool | Use |\n|------|-----|\n| Jira Service Management | Ticketing system (API + comments) |\n| Google Gemini/Gemma | LLM analysis |\n| HTTP Basic Auth | For Jira API requests (bot user) |\n\n⚠️ **Setup tip**: create a dedicated **bot user** in Jira Service Management with an API token.  \nThis ensures clean audit logs, proper permissions, and avoids mixing automation with human accounts.\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 Customization Tips\n\n- Replace `https://your-jsm-url/...` with your own Jira Service Management domain.  \n- Update the credentials with the **bot user’s API token** created above.  \n- Swap Jira Service Management nodes with other ticketing systems like **Zendesk**, **Freshdesk**, or **ServiceNow**.  \n- Extend the domain schema (`keywords`, `guidance_addons`) to fit your product or support environment.  \n\n---\n\n### 🗂️ Domain Schema\n\nThis workflow uses a **domain-driven schema** to guide triage.  \nIt defines:  \n- **Components** → valid areas for classification  \n- **Priority policies & rules** → how severity is determined  \n- **Keywords** → domain-specific signals (e.g., “API error”, “all users affected”)  \n- **Guidance addons** → contextual next steps for engineers  \n- **No-workaround phrases** → escalate severity if present  \n\n✨ The **full domain JSON** (with complete keyword & guidance mapping) is included as a sticky note inside the workflow.  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Use Cases  \n- Automated triage for IT & support tickets  \n- Incident classification with outage/security detection  \n- Contextual guidance for engineers in customer support  \n- Faster escalation and routing of critical issues  \n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Who It’s For  \n- Support teams running Jira Service Management  \n- Platform teams automating internal ticket ops  \n- AI consultants prototyping practical triage workflows  \n- Builders exploring **CAG today, RAG tomorrow**  \n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Try It Out!  \n1. ⚙️ **Import the Workflow** in n8n (cloud or self-hosted).  \n2. 🔑 **Add Credentials** (JSM API + Gemini key).  \n3. ⚡ **Configure Setup** (confidence threshold, triage label, domain rules).  \n4. 🔗 **Connect Webhook** in JSM → `issue_created` → n8n webhook URL.  \n5. 🧪 **Test with a Ticket** → see auto-updates + AI audit comment.  \n6. 🔄 **Swap the Ticketing System** → adapt HTTP nodes for **Zendesk, Freshdesk, or ServiceNow**.  \n\n---\n\n## 💬 Have Feedback or Ideas? I’d Love to Hear  \nThis project is open, modular, and evolving. \nIf you try it, adapt it, or extend it, I’d love to hear your feedback — let’s improve it together in the n8n builder community. \n\n📧 [ascuncia.es@gmail.com](mailto:ascuncia.es+n8ncreator@gmail.com) \n🔗[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-scuncia-60a62348/)\n",
