## 🧱 Workflow Steps

### 1. **Run Daily at 8 AM** (`Cron Node`)

Automatically triggers the workflow every morning at 8:00 AM. You can adjust the time as needed.

### 2. **Calculate Today's Date Range** (`Function Node`)

Generates the ISO-formatted start and end times for the current day (00:00–23:59). These values are passed to the Google Calendar node for querying events.

### 3. **Fetch All Today's Calendar Events** (`Google Calendar Node`)

Fetches all events scheduled for today using your Google account. The calendar email (`your-email@example.com`) should be replaced with your actual email.

### 4. **Process Events One by One** (`SplitInBatches Node`)

Splits the list of events into single items for individual processing.

### 5. **Extract Event Details for Trello** (`Set Node`)

Maps each event’s details (summary, description, start time, and URL) into structured fields ready for Trello card creation.

### 6. **Filter Out Routine Events** (`If Node`)

Skips over common recurring events (like “Check email,” “Lunch,” “Wrap Up & Clear Desk,” or “Beers and Griping”). You can customize this list as needed.

### 7. **Create New Trello Card with Template** (`Trello Node`)

For non-filtered events, creates a new Trello card using a predefined meeting notes template. Includes:

* Title: Event summary
* Due date: Event start time
* Description: Preformatted meeting notes layout
* Source URL: Event link from Google Calendar

### 8. **Skip Filtered Event** (`NoOp Node`)

Handles skipped events gracefully without performing any action.
