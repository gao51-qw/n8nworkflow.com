  "title": "AI email analyzer: Process PDFs, images & save to Google Drive + Telegram",
  "description": "This workflow automates the process of **analyzing emails and their attachments** (PDFs and images) using **AI models** (DeepSeek, Gemini, and OpenRouter). It extracts and summarizes the content of emails and attachments, saves the summaries to **Google Sheets**, and sends a final consolidated summary via **Telegram**. \n\nThis is a powerful tool for automating email analysis and summarization, saving time and ensuring that important information is easily accessible and actionable.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to process incoming emails, analyze their content and attachments, and generate summaries. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Email Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node, which monitors an email inbox for new emails.\n   - If an email contains attachments, the workflow processes them.\n\n2. **Check for Attachments**:\n   - The **Contain Attachments?** node checks if the email has attachments.\n   - If attachments are present, the workflow proceeds to process them.\n\n3. **Process Attachments**:\n   - The **Get PDF and Images Attachments** node extracts PDF and image attachments from the email.\n   - The **Switch** node separates PDFs and images for further processing:\n     - **PDFs**: The **Extract from PDF** node extracts text from PDFs, and the **PDF Analyzer** node summarizes the content.\n     - **Images**: The **Analyze Image** node uses AI to describe the content of images.\n\n4. **Summarize Email Content**:\n   - The **Convert Text** node converts the email's HTML content to plain text.\n   - The **Email Summarization Chain** node uses AI to generate a summary of the email's text content.\n\n5. **Save Summaries**:\n   - The **Save Summary PDF**, **Save Summary Image**, and **Save Summary Text** nodes save the summaries of PDFs, images, and email text, respectively, to **Google Sheets**.\n\n6. **Consolidate Summaries**:\n   - The **All Summaries** node aggregates the summaries of the email text, PDFs, and images.\n   - The **Create Final Summary** node uses AI to generate a unified summary of all the content.\n\n7. **Send Final Summary**:\n   - The **Send Final Summary** node sends the consolidated summary via **Telegram** to a specified chat ID.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **IMAP Configuration**:\n   - Set up **IMAP** credentials in n8n for the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node.\n   - Ensure the email account is accessible via IMAP.\n\n2. **AI Model Configuration**:\n   - Configure the **DeepSeek**, **Gemini**, and **OpenRouter** credentials in n8n for the **Email Summarization Chain**, **PDF Analyzer**, and **Create Final Summary** nodes.\n   - Ensure the AI models are set up to generate summaries.\n\n3. **Google Sheets Integration**:\n   - Set up **Google Sheets** credentials in n8n for the **Save Summary PDF**, **Save Summary Image**, and **Save Summary Text** nodes.\n   - Specify the Google Sheet and worksheet where the summaries will be saved.\n\n4. **Telegram Integration**:\n   - Set up **Telegram** credentials in n8n for the **Send Final Summary** node.\n   - Insert your **Chat ID** in the Telegram node to receive the final summary.\n\n5. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Send an email with attachments (PDFs and images) to the monitored email account.\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Extract and summarize the email content and attachments.\n     - Save the summaries to Google Sheets.\n     - Send a consolidated summary via Telegram.\n\n6. **Optional Customization**:\n     - replace IMAP trigger with Gmail or Outlook trigger \n     - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more AI models for different types of analysis.\n     - Sending notifications via other channels (e.g., Slack, email).\n     - Integrating with other storage services (e.g., Dropbox, AWS S3).\n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
