## Overview

This automated workflow delivers a weekly digest of the most important AI news directly to your inbox. Every Monday at 9 AM, it uses Perplexity AI to research the latest developments and organizes them into four key categories: New Technology, Trending Topics, Top Stories, and AI Security. The workflow then formats this information into a beautifully designed HTML email with summaries, significance explanations, and source links.
