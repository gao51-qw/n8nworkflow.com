 ## Introduction
Automates stock market analysis using multiple AI models to predict trends, analyze sentiment, and generate consensus-based investment insights. For traders and analysts seeking data-driven forecasts by eliminating manual research and combining AI perspectives for accurate predictions.

## How It Works
Daily trigger fetches stock data, news, ratings, and sentiment → AI models analyze each source → OpenAI generates report → Three AI validators (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) cross-verify → Consensus evaluation → Telegram alert with insights.

## Workflow Template
Schedule → Fetch Stock Data → Fetch News → Fetch Ratings → Fetch Sentiment → AI Analysis → Combine → Generate Report (GPT) → Validate (3 AIs) → Evaluate Consensus → Send Telegram

## Workflow Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Scheduled trigger fetches prices, news, analyst ratings, and social trends
2. **AI Analysis:** Separate models analyze stocks, news sentiment, ratings, and social discussions
3. **Report Generation:** OpenAI GPT combines analyses into comprehensive market report
4. **Multi-AI Validation:** Three AI models independently validate predictions for accuracy
5. **Consensus Building:** Evaluates AI agreement to determine confidence levels
