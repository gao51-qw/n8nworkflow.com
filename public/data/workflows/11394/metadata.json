  "description": "## **Overview**\n\nStop struggling with content creation for your e-commerce store. This workflow acts as your automated AI Content Marketer, instantly transforming your Shopify product details into high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts. It handles everything from reading product data to writing the article and uploading it directly to your store as a draft.\n\n#### What this workflow does\n\n- Fetches Product Data: Automatically pulls product titles and descriptions directly from your Shopify store (configurable limit).\n- Data Logging: Backs up the raw product data into Google Sheets for record-keeping before processing.\n- AI SEO Writing: Uses a powerful LLM (via OpenRouter/DeepSeek) to write a complete, engaging blog post based on the product's features. It generates an SEO-friendly title and formats the body content in clean HTML (headings, bullet points, etc.).\n- Smart Parsing: A custom Code node ensures the AI's output is strictly formatted as JSON, separating the Blog Title from the Blog Content to prevent errors.\n- Auto-Drafting in Shopify: Uploads the generated article directly to your specific Shopify Blog ID as a \"Draft\" (so you can review it before publishing).\n- Email Notification: Sends a confirmation email via Gmail to let you know your new blog posts are ready for review.\n\n#### Setup Requirements\nTo run this workflow, you will need to set up credentials in n8n for the following services:\n\n- Shopify Admin API: To fetch products and create articles. (You will need your Shop Name and an Access Token).\n- OpenRouter (or OpenAI): To power the AI Agent. The template is configured for DeepSeek via OpenRouter, but can be swapped for OpenAI.\n- Google Sheets: To log product data and generated blog content.\n- Gmail: To send the completion notification.\n\n#### How to use\n- Configure Variables: Double-click the \"Variables\" node (Set node) at the start of the workflow. Enter your shop name (e.g., my-store from my-store.myshopify.com) and your blogId (found in the URL when viewing your blog in Shopify Admin).\n- Connect Google Sheets: Open the Google Sheets nodes and map them to a sheet in your Drive. Ensure your sheet has columns for ID, Title, and Description.\n- Select AI Model: In the Chat Model node, ensure your API key is connected (OpenRouter is used by default for cost-efficiency).\n- Run: Execute the workflow. It will process your products and populate your Shopify Blog with new drafts automatically.\n\n#### Video Tutorial\nWatch the full setup guide here: [Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCwFc57V6oo)\n",
