How It Works
-
This workflow automates the real estate lead qualification process by leveraging property data from BatchData. The automation follows these steps:

1. When a new lead is received through your CRM webhook, the workflow captures their address information
2. It then makes an API call to BatchData to retrieve comprehensive property details
3. A sophisticated scoring algorithm evaluates the lead based on property characteristics like:

- Property value (higher values earn more points)
- Square footage (larger properties score higher)
- Property age (newer constructions score higher)
- Investment status (non-owner occupied properties earn bonus points)
- Lot size (larger lots receive additional score)

4. Leads are automatically classified into categories (high-value, qualified, potential, or unqualified)
5. The workflow updates your CRM with enriched property data and qualification scores
6. High-value leads trigger immediate follow-up tasks for your team
7. Notifications are sent to your preferred channel (Slack in this example)

The entire process happens within seconds of receiving a new lead, ensuring your sales team can prioritize the most valuable opportunities immediately..

Who It's For
-
This workflow is perfect for:

- Real estate agents and brokers looking to prioritize high-value property leads

Any business that bases lead qualification on property details will benefit from this automated qualification system.
