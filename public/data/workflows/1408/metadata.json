  "description": "Read a value by key from a local json file.\n\nRelated workflow: [WriteKey](https://n8n.io/workflows/1407)\n\nCreate a subfolder in your n8n homedir: `/home/node/.n8n/local-files`. In docker look at the data path and create a subfolder `local-files`.\nSet the correct access rights `chmod 1000.1000 local-files`.\n\nPut the workflow code in a new workflow named `GetKey`.\n\nCreate another workflow with a `function item`:\n\n```js\nreturn  {\n  file: '/4711.json', // 4711 should be your workflow id\n  key: 'MyKey',\n  default: 'Optional returned value if key is empty / not exists'\n}\n```\n\nPipe the `function item` to an `Execution Workflow` that calls the `GetKey` workflow.\n\nIt would be nice if we could get someday a shiny built-in n8n node that does the job. :)",
