Tired of manually clicking through each page in the Google Search Console? 😴 Say goodbye to that tedious process and hello to automation with this n8n workflow! 🎉\n\n**NB: this workflow was tested with sitemap.xml generated by Ghost CMS and WordPress.\nReach out to [Eduard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parsadanyan/) if you need help adapting this workflow to your specific use-case!**\n\n## ⚙️ How this automation works\n\n1. 📅 The workflow runs on a schedule or when you click \"Test workflow\".\n2. 🌐 It fetches the website's primary sitemap.xml and extracts all the content-specific sitemaps (this is a typical structure of the sitemap).\n3. 📑 Each content-specific sitemap is then parsed to retrieve the individual page data.\n4. 🔄 The extracted page data is converted to JSON format for easy manipulation.\n5. 🗃️ The `lastmod` (last modified date) and `loc` (page URL) fields are assigned to each page entry to ensure compliance with the [Sitemap protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html).\n6. 🔀 The page entries are sorted by the `lastmod` field in descending order (newest to oldest).\n7. 🔁 The workflow then loops over each page entry and performs the following steps:\n   - 🔍 Checks the URL metadata in the Google Indexing API.\n   - ✅ If the page is new or has been updated since the last indexing request, it sends a request to the Google Indexing API to update the URL.\n   - ⏳ Wait a sec and move on with the next page.\n\n## 🌟 Benefits\n\n- ⏰ Save time by automating the indexing process.\n- 🎯 Ensure all your website pages are consistently indexed by Google.\n- 🚀 Improve your website's visibility and search engine rankings.\n- 🛠️ Customize the workflow to fit your specific CMS and requirements.\n\n## 🔧 Getting started\n\nTo start using this powerful n8n workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. ☑️ Make sure to verify the website ownership in the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).\n2. 👨‍💻 Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n3. **Edit the `Get sitemap.xml` node and update the URL with your website's valid sitemap.xml**\n4. 🔑 Set up the necessary credentials for the Google Indexing API.\n5. 🎚️ Adjust the schedule trigger to run the workflow at your desired frequency.\n7. 🎉 Sit back and let the workflow handle the indexing process for you!\n\nReady to take your website indexing to the next level? 🚀 Try this workflow now and see the difference it makes! 😊\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 1\nNeed help with connecting Google Cloud Platform to n8n? Check out our [article on connecting Google Sheets to n8n](https://blog.n8n.io/google-sheets-as-database/#step-1-obtain-google-service-account-credentials). The process is mainly the same. When activating Google APIs, make sure to add `Web Search Indexing API`. Also, in the credential page of n8n, add the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/indexing` scope:\n\n![image.png](fileId:781)\n\nCheck out [Yulia's page](https://n8n.io/creators/yulia/) for more n8n workflows!\n\n### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE 2\nFree Google Cloud Platform account allows (re)indexing only 200 pages per day. If your website has more, then the workflow will automatically fail on quota limit ⛔. Next day it will skip the previously added items and continue with remaining pages. \n\n***Example:*** Assuming you have a free Google account, 500 pages on your website and they don't change for 3 days:\n* On the first day 200 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow will fail due to quota limits.\n* On the second day, the workflow will check 200 pages again and skip them (because the date of re-indexing is later then the page last modified date). The next 200 pages will be added to indexing. Workflow will fail again due to quota limits.\n* On the third day 400 pages will be checked and skipped, the last 100 pages will be added for indexing and the workflow finishes successfully.",
