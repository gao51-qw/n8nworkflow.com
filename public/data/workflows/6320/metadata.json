  "description": "## 👤 Who’s it for\n\n- **Anyone** who needs to recursively fetch **all files** from a specific Google Drive folder, including files inside all its nested (child) folders.\n- Ideal for **automation builders**, **admins**, and **integrators** who want to process, move, list, or report on all files in a complex folder tree.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow will:\n1. **Accept a Google Drive Folder ID** as an input (from another workflow or trigger).\n2. **Recursively discover all child folders** starting from the parent, no matter how many levels deep.\n3. **Collect all file IDs & names** from every folder (parent + all descendants).\n4. **Return a clean list** of all found files (with IDs and names) for further automation, downloading, or processing.\n\n**Key features:**\n- 💡 **Works recursively** (handles any depth of nested folders).\n- 🏷️ **Outputs file ID & file name** for each discovered file.\n- 🔄 **Can be triggered by other workflows** (great for modular automation).\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to set up\n\n#### 1. **Google Drive Credentials**\n- Make sure you’ve set up a **Google Drive OAuth2 credential** in n8n.\n- Connect this credential to all Google Drive nodes in the workflow.\n\n#### 2. **Parent Folder ID**\n- Input the Google Drive folder ID you want to start from.\n- **How to pass it:**  \n  - If running standalone: update the `When Executed by Another Workflow` node with your folder ID.\n  - If called from another workflow: pass the folder ID as an input named `id`.\n\n#### 3. **Check Set Nodes**\n- There are two Set nodes (`Return parent` and `Return parent1`) and one trigger (`When Executed by Another Workflow`) where you might want to update the hardcoded folder ID.\n- ⚠️ **Change these IDs to match your use case.**\n\n#### 4. **Run the Workflow**\n- Start the workflow (or execute it via another workflow).\n- The result will be a flat list of files in all subfolders.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- 🟢 **n8n instance**\n- 🟢 **Google Drive OAuth2 credentials** connected in n8n\n- 🟢 **A valid Google Drive folder ID** to start from\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 How to customize\n\n- **Return Extra Data:**  \n  Add fields in the “Search files” node options to return more Google Drive file metadata (e.g., size, webViewLink).\n- **Filter by File Type:**  \n  Adjust the search query or add a filter node to only include certain file types (e.g., PDFs, Docs).\n- **Change Output Format:**  \n  Edit the “Edit Fields” Set node to structure your output differently.\n- **Integrate Further:**  \n  Add new nodes after the Loop to, for example, download, email, or sync files as needed.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Notes & Tips\n\n- **Performance:**  \n  This workflow is optimized for up to hundreds of folders. For very large Drive accounts (thousands of folders/files), consider pagination or batching.\n- **Credential Security:**  \n  Always use n8n’s built-in credential manager—never hard-code sensitive data.\n- **Static IDs:**  \n  As noted in the sticky note, make sure to update all hardcoded folder IDs for your production use.\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ Node Overview\n\n- **When Executed by Another Workflow:** Accepts a folder ID (entry point).\n- **Google Drive – Get children folders:** Lists subfolders of the given folder.\n- **If:** Checks if the folder contains any subfolders.\n- **Execute Workflow:** Handles recursion (calls itself on child folders).\n- **Code:** Flattens all discovered folder IDs for next step.\n- **Loop Over Items:** Iterates over all folders to process files.\n- **Google Drive – Search files:** Finds all files in each folder.\n- **Edit Fields (Set):** Structures file data for output.\n- **Sticky Note:** Documentation and reminders inside your workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Example Output\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"file_id\": \"1A2B3C...\",\n    \"file_name\": \"MyDoc.pdf\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"file_id\": \"2B3C4D...\",\n    \"file_name\": \"Presentation.pptx\"\n  }\n]\n",
