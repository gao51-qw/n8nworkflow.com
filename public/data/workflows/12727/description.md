A production-ready n8n workflow that generates AI avatar videos from images and text using **VEED Fabric 1.0**, with flexible multi-platform publishing capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

### Unlimited Scale
- **Process any number of videos**: Sequential processing ensures each video is fully generated and published before moving to the next
- **Batch processing**: Add multiple video requests to Google Sheet and let the workflow process them automatically
- **No context mixing**: Each video maintains its own configuration throughout the entire pipeline

### Flexible Publishing
- **Per-video platform selection**: Each video can target different platforms (e.g., Video 1 → Instagram+YouTube, Video 2 → Telegram only)
- **Optional publishing**: Leave PLATFORMS column empty to generate videos without publishing (videos saved to Drive)
- **Supported platforms**: Instagram Reels, YouTube/Shorts, Facebook, Telegram, Threads
- **Platform-specific formatting**: Automatic optimization for each platform's requirements

### Smart Processing
- **Two TTS providers**: Choose OpenAI or ElevenLabs per video
- **Configurable quality**: Select resolution (480p/720p) and aspect ratio (9:16, 16:9, 1:1) per video
- **Approval workflow**: Review videos before publishing with email approve/reject buttons
- **Error handling**: Automatic error detection with detailed email notifications

### Status Tracking
- **Real-time status updates**: Google Sheet updates as workflow progresses (new → processing → published)
- **Detailed results**: Per-platform success/failure tracking with post URLs
- **Email reports**: Comprehensive publishing reports with links to all posted content

## How It Works
1. **Input**: Add rows to Google Sheet with video details
