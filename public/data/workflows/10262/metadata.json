  "title": "Reduce meeting no-shows with Gemini AI, email & WhatsApp reminders for Calendly",
  "description": "## **How it works:**\nThis n8n workflow automates communication with meeting invitees to decrease no-show rates by sending timely email and WhatsApp reminders, and a clarification request if more information is needed to prepare the meeting.\n\n## **Step-by-step:**\nThe workflow is triggered by an incoming email notification from Calendly about a newly scheduled meeting.\n\n- It uses AI to extract key meeting data from the email content.\n- It checks if the invitee didn't provide sufficient information, and, if there is a need for more information, sends a clarification request email.\n- It calculates the waiting time required for the 24-hour and 1-hour reminders.\n- It uses an If node to determine the correct waiting path based on the meeting time.\n- It uses Wait nodes for timing the reminders correctly.\n- Finally, it sends a reminder email and a WhatsApp reminder before the meeting. \n\n## **Customization Options:**\n- Replace Google Gemini with your preferred LLM model (though Gemini works on the free tier).\n- Tailor email and WhatsApp messages to speak your brand's language.\n- Replace Twillio node to WhatsApp node to be a completly free usage flow.",
