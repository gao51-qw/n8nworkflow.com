## **How it works:**
This n8n workflow automates communication with meeting invitees to decrease no-show rates by sending timely email and WhatsApp reminders, and a clarification request if more information is needed to prepare the meeting.

## **Step-by-step:**
The workflow is triggered by an incoming email notification from Calendly about a newly scheduled meeting.

- It uses AI to extract key meeting data from the email content.
- It checks if the invitee didn't provide sufficient information, and, if there is a need for more information, sends a clarification request email.
- It calculates the waiting time required for the 24-hour and 1-hour reminders.
- It uses an If node to determine the correct waiting path based on the meeting time.
- It uses Wait nodes for timing the reminders correctly.
- Finally, it sends a reminder email and a WhatsApp reminder before the meeting. 

## **Customization Options:**
- Replace Google Gemini with your preferred LLM model (though Gemini works on the free tier).
- Tailor email and WhatsApp messages to speak your brand's language.
- Replace Twillio node to WhatsApp node to be a completly free usage flow.
