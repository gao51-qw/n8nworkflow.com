  "description": "# Google Drive Folder Duplicator\n\n**This n8n workflow creates a complete recursive copy of any Google Drive folder, preserving the entire folder structure, all files, and sharing permissions.**\n\n## What It Does\n\n- Duplicates folders with unlimited nested subfolders\n- Copies all files maintaining original names and metadata\n- Preserves sharing permissions (users, groups, domains)\n- Creates identical folder hierarchy in target location\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Initialize: Sets source/target folders and creates main destination folder\n2. Recursive Processing: Scans each folder level, splits files from subfolders\n3. File Handling: Copies files and applies original permissions\n4. Folder Handling: Creates subfolders and applies original permissions\n5. Self-Recursion: Calls itself for each subfolder to process unlimited nested levels\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Unlimited Depth: Handles any number of nested folder levels\n- Permission Preservation: Maintains exact sharing settings\n\n## Requirements\n\nGoogle Drive OAuth2 credentials with drive access",
