  "description": "## Use Case\nIt is very convenient to add expenses via simple chat message. This workflow attempts to do exactly this using AI-powered n8n magic!\n\n![20250129 at 17.37.png](fileId:921)\nSend message to a chat, something like **\"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"**\n\nAnd get a response:\n**Your expense saved, here is the output of save sub-workflow:{\"cost\":59.3,\"descr\":\"car wash\",\"date\":\"2024-01-25\",\"msg\":\"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"}**\n\n\nLLM will smartly parse your message to structured JSON and save the expense as a new row into Google Sheet!\n\n\n\n## Installation\n### 1. Set up Google Sheets:\nClone this Sheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0r3tun7LF7Ypb21CmbTKEtn76WE-kaHvBCM5NdgiPU/edit?gid=0#gid=0\n\n(File -&gt; Make a copy)\n\nChoose this sheet into \"Save expense into Google Sheets\" node.\n\n\n### 2. Fix sub-workflow dropdown: \nopen \"Parse msg and save to Sheets\" node (which is an n8n sub-workflow executor tool) and make sure the SAME workflow is chosen in the dropdown. it will allow n8n to locate and call \"Workflow Input Trigger\" properly when needed.\n\n\n### 3. Activate the workflow to make chat work properly.\nSent message to chat, something like \"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"\n\nyou should get a response:\nYour expense saved, here is the output of save sub-workflow:{\"cost\":59.3,\"descr\":\"car wash\",\"date\":\"2024-01-25\",\"msg\":\"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"}\n\nand new row in Google sheets should be inserted!\n",
