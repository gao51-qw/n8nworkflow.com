Transform patient intake from paperwork chaos into intelligent, automated triage that detects emergencies, prepares providers with comprehensive briefs, and streamlines scheduling—improving patient safety while saving 15-20 hours per week.

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

Automates the complete patient intake and appointment preparation process with medical-grade AI:

1. **📋 Digital Patient Intake** - HIPAA-compliant Jotform captures comprehensive medical information

   - **Routine (40-69)**: Scheduler 1-2 week booking → Confirmation email → Standard prep
   - **Non-Urgent (0-39)**: Flexible scheduling → Wellness visit workflow
5. **📄 Provider Prep Briefs** - Comprehensive pre-appointment analysis with:
   - Differential diagnosis (3-5 possible conditions)
   - Key questions to ask patient
   - Recommended exams and tests
   - Critical alerts (drug interactions, allergies, age considerations)
