## Use case
If you have a form where potential leads reach out, then you probably want to analyze those leads and send a notification if certain requirements are met, e.g. employee number is high enough. MadKudu is built exactly to solve this problem. We use it along with Hunter and Gmail to get an email alert for high quality leads.
