  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* \n\n# Clean Web Content Extraction with Anti-Bot Fallback\nExtract clean and structured text from any webpage with optional fallback to an anti-bot scraping service. Ideal for AI tools and content workflows.\n\n## 🧠 How it Works\nThis sub-workflow enables reliable and clean scraping of any public webpage by simply passing a **url** parameter. It is designed to be embedded into other workflows or used as a tool for AI agents.\n\nIt supports two output modes:\n- **fulltext:** `true` — returns *{ title, text }* with full page content\n- **fulltext:** `false` — returns *{ title, url, content }* with a short excerpt\n\n💡 If the site is protected by anti-bot systems (like Cloudflare), it will automatically fallback to [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/), a scraping API with a generous free plan.\n\n🧩 This template requires the [n8n-nodes-webpage-content-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-webpage-content-extractor) community node, so it only works in self-hosted n8n environments.\n\n## 🚀 Use Cases\n- As a reusable sub-workflow, via **Execute Sub-workflow** node.\n-  As a tool for an AI Agent, compatible with **Call n8n Workflow Tool**.\n\nPerfect for chatbots, summarization workflows, or RSS/feed enrichment. Empowers your AI Agent with the ability to browse and extract readable content from websites automatically.\n\n## 🔖 Parameters\n- `url` (string): the webpage URL to scrape\n- `fulltext` (boolean): set `true` for full page content, `false` for summarized output\n\n## ⚙️ Setup\n- Install the community node [n8n-nodes-webpage-content-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-webpage-content-extractor) in your self-hosted n8n instance.\n- Create a free account at [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) and obtain your API Token.\n- In the workflow, locate the **Scrape.do HTTP Request** node and configure the credentials using your API Token.\n- Detailed step-by-step instructions are available in the workflow notes.\n\nThe Scrape.do API is only used as a fallback when conventional scraping fails, helping you preserve your API credits.",
