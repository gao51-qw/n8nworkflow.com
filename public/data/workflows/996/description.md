This workflow demonstrates how to use `currentRunIndex` to get the running index.

**Function node:** This node generates mock data for the workflow. Replace it with the node whose data you want to split into batches.

**SplitInBatches node:** This node splits the data with the batch size equal to `1`. Based on your use-case, set the value of the Batch Size.

**IF node:** This node checks the running index. If the running index equals `5` the node returns `true` and breaks the loop.
The node uses the expression `{{$node["SplitInBatches"].context["currentRunIndex"];}}`, which returns the running index.

**Set node:** This node prints a message `Loop Ended`. Based on your use-case, connect the false output of the *IF* node to the input of the node you want to execute if the condition is `false`.
