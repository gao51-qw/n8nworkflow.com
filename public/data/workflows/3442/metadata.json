  "description": "## Description\n\nThis comprehensive n8n automation template orchestrates a complete end-to-end workflow for generating engaging short-form Point-of-View (POV) style videos using multiple AI services and automatically publishing them across major social media platforms. It takes ideas from a Google Sheet and transforms them into finished videos with captions, voiceovers, and platform-specific descriptions, ready for distribution.\n\n### Who Is This For?\n\n*   **Content Creators & Agencies:** Mass-produce unique short-form video content for various clients or channels with minimal manual effort.\n*   **Digital Marketers:** Automate video content pipelines to boost online presence and engagement across multiple platforms simultaneously.\n*   **Social Media Managers:** Schedule and distribute consistent video content efficiently without juggling multiple tools and manual uploads.\n*   **Businesses:** Leverage AI to create branded video content for marketing, reducing production time and costs.\n\n### What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\n\nCreating and distributing high-quality short-form video content consistently across multiple social networks is incredibly time-consuming and resource-intensive. This workflow tackles these challenges by:\n\n*   **Automating Idea-to-Video Pipeline:** Generates video concepts, image prompts, scripts, images, video clips, and voiceovers using AI.\n*   **Streamlining Video Assembly:** Automatically combines generated assets into a final video using a template.\n*   **Generating Platform-Optimized Descriptions:** Creates relevant descriptions for posts by transcribing the final video audio.\n*   **Automating Multi-Platform Publishing:** Uploads the final video and description to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn simultaneously.\n*   **Reducing Manual Workload:** Drastically cuts down the time and effort required for video production and distribution.\n*   **Centralized Tracking:** Updates a Google Sheet with results, costs, and status for easy monitoring.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1.  **Trigger & Input:** Runs on a daily schedule (configurable) and fetches new video ideas from a designated Google Sheet.\n2.  **AI Content Generation:**\n    *   Uses OpenAI to generate video captions and image prompts based on the idea.\n    *   Uses PiAPI (Flux) to generate images from prompts.\n    *   Uses PiAPI (Kling) to generate video clips from the images (Image-to-Video).\n    *   Uses OpenAI to generate a voiceover script based on the captions.\n    *   Uses ElevenLabs to generate voiceover audio from the script and uploads it to Google Drive.\n3.  **Video Assembly:** Combines the generated video clips, captions, and voiceover audio using a Creatomate template to render the final video.\n4.  **Description Generation:** Uploads the final video to Google Drive, extracts the audio using OpenAI (Whisper), and generates a social media description using OpenAI (GPT).\n5.  **Multi-Platform Distribution:** Uses upload-post.com to upload the final video and generated description to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn.\n6.  **Tracking & Notification:** Updates the original Google Sheet row with output details (video link, costs, tokens used) and sends a completion notification via Discord.\n\n### Setup\n\n1.  **Accounts & API Keys:** Obtain accounts and generate API keys/credentials for:\n    *   n8n\n    *   Google Cloud Platform (for Google Sheets & Google Drive APIs + OAuth Credentials)\n    *   OpenAI\n    *   PiAPI\n    *   ElevenLabs\n    *   Creatomate\n    *   upload-post.com\n    *   Discord (Webhook URL)\n2.  **Google Sheet:** Make a copy of the provided [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cjd8p_yx-M-3gWLEd5TargtoB35cW-3y66AOTNMQrrM/edit?usp=sharing) and connect it in the `Load Google Sheet` node.\n3.  **Creatomate Template:** Set up a video template in Creatomate (use the [provided JSON source code](https://pastebin.com/c7aMTeLK) as a base) and note its Template ID.\n4.  **Configure Nodes:**\n    *   Enter all API Keys/Credentials in the `Set API Keys` node and other relevant credential sections (Google nodes, upload-post nodes, etc.).\n    *   Configure Google Drive nodes (Folder IDs, Permissions).\n    *   Configure the `upload-post.com` nodes with your user identifier and necessary platform details (e.g., Facebook Page ID).\n    *   Customize AI prompts within the OpenAI nodes (`Generate Video Captions`, `Generate Image Prompts`, `Generate Script`, `Generate Description...`) if desired.\n    *   Set the Discord Webhook URL in the `Notify me on Discord` node.\n5.  **Enable Google APIs:** Ensure Google Drive API and Google Sheets API are enabled in your Google Cloud Project.\n\n### Requirements\n\n*   **Accounts:** n8n, Google (Sheets, Drive, Cloud Platform), OpenAI, PiAPI, ElevenLabs, Creatomate, [The social media api Upload-Post](https://www.upload-post.com), Discord.\n*   **API Keys & Credentials:** API Keys for OpenAI, PiAPI, ElevenLabs, Creatomate, upload-post.com. Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Credentials. Discord Webhook URL.\n*   **Templates:** A configured Google Sheet based on the template, a configured Creatomate video template.\n*   **(Potentially) Paid Plans:** Some services (OpenAI, PiAPI, Creatomate, upload-post.com) may require paid plans depending on usage volume after free trials/credits are exhausted.\n\nUse this template to build a powerful, automated video content factory, scaling your production and distribution efforts across the social media landscape.",
