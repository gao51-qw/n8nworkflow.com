  "description": "### Description\nQuickly organize your inbox with AI!\nThis simple workflow automatically classifies incoming emails into different categories — like High Priority, Work Related, or Promotions — and applies Gmail labels accordingly.\nSetup takes less than 2 minutes, and it runs 24/7, helping you stay focused on what matters most without manual sorting.\n\n### Tools/Services Needed\n* Gmail: To trigger the workflow and label emails.\n* Google Gemini (or any LLM Model): To intelligently classify email content.\n\n\n### How It Works\n1. Gmail Trigger: Detects every new incoming email.\n\n\n2. Text Classifier Node: Classifies the email content into predefined categories.\n\n\n3. Google Gemini Chat Model: Provides the AI-powered understanding behind the classification.\n4. Conditional Labeling:\n- If the email is High Priority, label it accordingly.\n- If it’s Work Related (e.g., internal emails), apply the work label.\n- If it’s a Promotion, sort it into the promotions label.\n5. Gmail Labeling: Automatically adds the correct label to the email.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n* Connect your Gmail account to n8n.\n* Connect your Google Gemini (or other LLM) credentials.\n* Customize the categories and labels if needed.\n* Activate the workflow — and that's it!\n\n### Notes\n* You can easily add more categories (like \"Finance,\" \"Newsletters,\" etc.) by adjusting the classification prompt.\n* Works best with a clean and minimal set of categories to avoid overlap.\n* Can be adapted to work with any other large language model (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) if preferred.",
