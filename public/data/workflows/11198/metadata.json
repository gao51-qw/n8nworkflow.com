  "description": "## AI Sales Analyst & Lead Router\n\n### This n8n template handles the post-call process for your business. It uses the call recording to extract valuable data and handles the prospect based on their budget.\n\nSome use cases: Sales follow-ups, auto-qualifying leads based on budget, monetizing low-budget leads, and automatic data entry.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Ingestion:** When a call recording is uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, the workflow is triggered.\n2. **Transcription:** OpenAI's model transcribes the call recording.\n3. **Analysis:** The GPT-4o model analyzes the transcript and extracts crucial information.\n4. **Lead classification:** The extracted budget is checked against your defined threshold (e.g., $5,000).\n    * **Hot leads (Budget &gt; 5k):** The workflow logs the data in Airtable (CRM), creates a high-priority task, and instantly alerts the team via a Slack channel.\n    * **Warm leads (Budget &lt; 5k):** The workflow logs the data, creates a low-priority task, and emails the lead, offering a cheaper alternative.\n5. **Logging:** Every execution is logged in Airtable.\n\n### How to use the workflow\n1. **Configure Google Drive:** Open the Trigger node and select the destination folder for the call recordings.\n2. **Set your Threshold:** Open the **If** node and set your desired budget (currently set to 5,000).\n3. **Customize the email:** Open the Gmail node in Phase 2B and modify the email according to your own preferences.\n4. **Database mapping:** Ensure that your Airtable base has the following columns: *Client Name*, *Budget*, *Sentiment*, *Summary*, *Date*, and *Timeline*.\n5. **Test it out!** Generate a sample audio file on ElevenLabs and upload it to your Google Drive folder.\n\n### Requirements\n* **Google Drive** (For storing audio recordings)\n* **OpenAI API Key** (Access to OpenAI models)\n* **Airtable** (For CRM and System Logging)\n* **Trello** (For Task Management)\n* **Slack** (For Team Notifications)\n* **Gmail** (For sending automated emails)",
