## AI Sales Analyst & Lead Router

### This n8n template handles the post-call process for your business. It uses the call recording to extract valuable data and handles the prospect based on their budget.

Some use cases: Sales follow-ups, auto-qualifying leads based on budget, monetizing low-budget leads, and automatic data entry.

### How it works
1. **Ingestion:** When a call recording is uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, the workflow is triggered.
2. **Transcription:** OpenAI's model transcribes the call recording.
3. **Analysis:** The GPT-4o model analyzes the transcript and extracts crucial information.
4. **Lead classification:** The extracted budget is checked against your defined threshold (e.g., $5,000).
    * **Hot leads (Budget &gt; 5k):** The workflow logs the data in Airtable (CRM), creates a high-priority task, and instantly alerts the team via a Slack channel.
    * **Warm leads (Budget &lt; 5k):** The workflow logs the data, creates a low-priority task, and emails the lead, offering a cheaper alternative.
5. **Logging:** Every execution is logged in Airtable.

### How to use the workflow
1. **Configure Google Drive:** Open the Trigger node and select the destination folder for the call recordings.
2. **Set your Threshold:** Open the **If** node and set your desired budget (currently set to 5,000).
3. **Customize the email:** Open the Gmail node in Phase 2B and modify the email according to your own preferences.
4. **Database mapping:** Ensure that your Airtable base has the following columns: *Client Name*, *Budget*, *Sentiment*, *Summary*, *Date*, and *Timeline*.
5. **Test it out!** Generate a sample audio file on ElevenLabs and upload it to your Google Drive folder.
