  "description": "# Smart Invoice Collection System with OpenAI, Gmail & Google Sheets\n\n**Categories:** Financial Automation, AI Business Tools, Cash Flow Management\n\nThis workflow creates an intelligent invoice collection system that automatically follows up on overdue invoices using AI-powered personalization. The system monitors your invoice database, analyzes email history to prevent inappropriate follow-ups, and sends increasingly urgent but professional reminders at precise intervals.
