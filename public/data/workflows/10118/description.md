## 🧭 Description

This section automates Gmail message handling through AI-powered classification and response.
Using the LangChain Text Classifier, incoming emails are analyzed and sorted into four categories — High Priority, Advertisement, Inquiry, and Finance/Billing — each triggering a dedicated action flow.

High Priority: AI generates a professional draft reply and saves it to Gmail.

Advertisement: AI summarizes content and logs it to Google Sheets.

Inquiry: AI composes a customer-friendly response automatically.

Finance/Billing: AI creates a brief summary and forwards it to the accounting email.

This system reduces manual sorting, ensures consistent communication quality, and speeds up email management with full automation.

Automatically categorize incoming Gmail messages by topic or intent.

Generate AI-written reply drafts for urgent business messages.
