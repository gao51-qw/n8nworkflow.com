### How to use

In Google Sheets:
- Create a Google Sheet, rename the sheet websites, and add all the domains or URLs you want to scan (one per row).


In this Workflow:
- Open “Set google sheet URL & original sheet name” and replace the example Google Sheet URL and the name of the source sheet (e.g., websites).
