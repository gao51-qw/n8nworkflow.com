  "description": "# 1. Workflow Overview\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the **generation and delivery of student completion certificates**.\n\nFeatures:\n- Retrieves student data from the n8n integrated datastore and processes it.\n- Loads a certificate template image and inserts the student's name and unique ID.\n- Generates a completion certificate and sends it automatically via email.\n\nBy using this workflow, the certificate issuance process can be streamlined and efficiently managed.\n\n---\n\n# 2. Prerequisites\nTo execute this workflow, you need to set up the following:\n\n✅ **Gmail OAuth2 Integration** (Required for sending certificates via Gmail in n8n)  \n✅ **n8n Training Customer Datastore Connection** (Ensure access to student data from the datastore)  \n✅ **Google Fonts Installation** (Required for using Courier New and Comic Sans MS fonts)  \n\n---\n\n# 3. Key Features & Roles\n\n### 📌 Node List & Functions\n\n1. **When clicking 'Test workflow' (Manual Trigger)**  \n   - Triggers the workflow manually for testing\n\n2. **Customer Datastore (n8n training)**  \n   - Retrieves student data from n8n's datastore\n\n3. **Get Email & Name (Set Node)**  \n   - Extracts the student's name and email\n\n4. **Generate Crypto (UUID Generation)**  \n   - Creates a unique ID for each certificate\n\n5. **Load Image (HTTP Request)**  \n   - Loads the certificate template image\n\n6. **Write Text(name) / Write Text(uuid) (Edit Image)**  \n   - Inserts the student's name and UUID onto the image to generate the certificate\n\n7. **Send Email (Gmail Node)**  \n   - Automatically sends the generated certificate via email\n\n---\n\n# 4. Workflow Process (Step-by-Step)\n\n1️⃣ **Retrieve Student Data** - Fetches name and email from the n8n Training Customer Datastore\n2️⃣ **Generate UUID** - Creates a unique ID for each certificate\n3️⃣ **Load Certificate Template Image** - Fetches the template via HTTP request\n4️⃣ **Insert Name and UUID into the Image**\n5️⃣ **Send Certificate via Gmail**\n\n---\n\n# 5. Expected Outputs\n\n- **Upon successful execution,** the student receives an email with the certificate image attached.\n- **Example of the sent email:**\n  ```\n  Dear John Doe,\n  \n  You have successfully completed this training program. Please find your completion certificate attached.\n  Completion Date: 2025.02.22\n  \n  Best regards,\n  Data Popcorn Team\n  ```\n- **Certificate Sharing Method:** The certificate can be downloaded and shared via email.",
