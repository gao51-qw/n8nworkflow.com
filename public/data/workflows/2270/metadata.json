  "description": "## Purpose\nThis ensures that executions of scheduled workflows do not overlap when they take longer than expected.\n\n## How it works\n- This is a separate workflow which monitors the execution of the main workflow\n- Stores a flag in Redis (key dynamically named after workflow ID) which indicates if the main workflow is running or idle\n- Only calls the main workflow if the last execution has finished\n\n## Setup\n- Update the credentials suitable for your Redis instance\n- Replace the **Schedule Trigger** of your main workflow by an **Execute Workflow Trigger**\n- Copy the workflow ID from the URL\n- Paste the workflow ID in the **Execute Workflow** Node of this workflow\n- Configure the **Schedule Trigger** Node\n",
