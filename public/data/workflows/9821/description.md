Automated workflow that generates custom AI image backgrounds from text prompts using Gemini's Nano Banana (native image generation), removes video backgrounds, and composites videos on AI-generated scenes. Create any background you can imagine without needing stock images.

## How it works

• **Describe background**: Provide video URL and text prompt describing desired background scene (e.g., "modern office with city skyline at golden hour")
• **AI generates image**: Gemini creates a background image from your prompt in ~10-20 seconds
• **Upload to Drive**: Generated background is saved to Google Drive and made publicly accessible
• **Remove & composite**: Video background is removed and composited on AI-generated scene with centered template
• **Save final video**: Completed video is uploaded to Google Drive with shareable link

**Triggers:** Webhook (for automation) or Manual (for testing)

**Processing time:** Typically 5-7 minutes total

**Prompt tips:** Be descriptive and specific. Instead of "office," try: "A modern minimalist office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a city skyline at golden hour. Warm sunlight, polished concrete floors, sleek wooden desks, green plants."
