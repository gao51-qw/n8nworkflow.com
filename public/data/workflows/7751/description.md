📦 **n8n Template Submission – “7-Day Content Bloom”**  
*by Shelly-Ann Davy, The Workflow Muse*

---

### 🌸 What it does  
Drop **one article URL or brain-dump idea** into this workflow and watch it blossom into **a week of graceful, feminine content** for Instagram, X/Twitter, Pinterest, and your Sunday-email love-note.  
AI writes every caption, tweet, pin title, FAQ, and CTA in **my signature warm-neuroscience tone**—then tucks everything into a clean Notion page for your final approval.  
Optional one-click scheduling to Tailwind & Pinterest keeps your feed blooming while you sip tea.

---

### 👩‍🎨 Who it’s for  
Creators, moms, and gentle-growth entrepreneurs who crave **consistent visibility without hustle energy**.

---

### 🪄 How it works  
1. **Trigger** – Webhook or Notion row status = “Ready to Repurpose”.  
2. **AI Muse** – `gpt-4o` crafts platform-specific copy in strict JSON.  
3. **Notion Oasis** – Every caption, tweet, pin, and FAQ lands in a single, beautiful page.  
4. **Optional Bloom** – Auto-schedule IG & Pinterest via Tailwind (toggle on/off).  
5. **Whisper notification** – Slack/Discord ping when the bouquet is ready.
