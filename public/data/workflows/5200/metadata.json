  "description": "This low-code automation enables all eCommerce store visitors to upload a **photo of themselves and virtually “try on”** a garment in just a few clicks. \n\nWith this workflow, **WooCommerce, Prestashop, Shopify** and more merchants can offer a cutting-edge “virtual try-on” feature with minimal development effort, enhancing customer engagement and reducing product returns.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Advantages**\n\n* **Zero-Coding, Visual Setup**\n  Build end-to-end e-commerce features with drag-and-drop nodes instead of custom backend code.\n\n* **Asynchronous, Scalable Processing**\n  Non-blocking “Wait” + “If” loop handles multi-second AI jobs gracefully, freeing up the workflow for other tasks.\n\n* **Dynamic Inputs & URLs**\n  Query strings (e.g. `?Product=IMAGE_URL`) allow you to embed the form on any product page and pass the garment image on the fly.\n\n* **Seamless User Experience**\n  Instant pop-up within your storefront and automatic redirect to the generated mock-up keeps shoppers engaged without page reloads.\n\n\n* **Easy Credential Management**\n  API keys, FTP credentials, and webhook IDs are all stored securely in n8n’s credential manager.\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Form Submission**:  \n   - A user submits a form with their name, an image of themselves (\"Me\"), and a hidden product image URL (\"Product\").  \n   - The form is triggered via the `On form submission` node, which collects the input data.  \n\n2. **Image Upload**:  \n   - The uploaded image (\"Me\") is sent to an FTP server for temporary storage using the `FTP` node. The filename includes a timestamp to ensure uniqueness.  \n\n3. **Virtual Try-on Request**:  \n   - The `Create Image` node sends a POST request to the Fal.run API, providing:  \n     - The uploaded human image URL (from FTP).  \n     - The product image URL (from the hidden form field).  \n   - This generates a virtual try-on result.  \n\n4. **Result Processing**:  \n   - The workflow checks the status of the image generation (`Get status` node) in a loop (with a 10-second wait between checks) until it is marked as \"COMPLETED.\"  \n   - Once ready, the final image URL is fetched (`Get Url image` node) and displayed to the user via a redirect (`Form` node).  \n\n5. **User Experience**:  \n   - The user is redirected to the generated try-on image, completing the process.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **API Key Setup**:  \n   - Create an account and obtain an API key.  \n   - Configure the `Create Image` node with HTTP Header Authentication:  \n     - **Name**: `Authorization`  \n     - **Value**: `Key YOURAPIKEY`  \n\n2. **FTP/S3 Configuration**:  \n   - Set up an FTP server or S3 bucket to temporarily store uploaded user images.  \n   - Configure the `FTP` node with your FTP credentials and storage path.  \n\n3. **Ecommerce Integration**:  \n   - On your WooCommerce site, add a \"Try On\" button that opens the form in a pop-up.  \n   - Dynamically pass the product image URL as a query parameter:  \n     - Example: `https://URL_N8N/form/ca1c314d-46c6-4eeb-b6a5-359XXXXXX?Product=IMAGE_URL`  \n\n4. **Testing**:  \n   - Verify the workflow by submitting a test form and ensuring the virtual try-on image is generated and displayed correctly.  \n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
