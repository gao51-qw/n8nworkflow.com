# Purpose & Audience
This workflow automates the process of finding and collecting contact information for local businesses in any city or region. Built entirely with free-tier APIs, it eliminates the need for expensive scraping services while delivering professional-quality lead generation results.
Perfect for agencies, freelancers, sales teams, and entrepreneurs who need to build targeted prospect lists without breaking the bank or dealing with complex scraping tools.

3. Extracts complete business details: name, address, phone, website, rating, and description
4. Scrapes business websites to find email addresses automatically
5. Handles edge cases gracefully: businesses without websites, failed scrapes, or missing data
6. Batches API requests with intelligent rate limiting to respect Google's quotas
