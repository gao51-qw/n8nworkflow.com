## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)
2. **AI Provider account** (OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom)
3. **Supabase account** with database access

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables
Add these to your n8n environment settings:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai              # or 'anthropic', 'custom'
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo         # or 'gpt-4', 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229'
AI_ENDPOINT=                    # Only for custom providers
```

**Recommended Models:**
- **Cost-effective**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fast, affordable, good for basic enrichment)
- **High-quality**: `gpt-4` or `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` (better inference, deeper insights)
- **Premium**: `claude-3-opus-20240229` (best for complex persona generation)

**How to set environment variables:**
- **n8n Cloud**: Go to Settings → Environment Variables
- **Self-hosted**: Add to your `.env` file or docker-compose configuration

### Step 2: Set Up Supabase Database
Create the logging table in your Supabase database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_logs (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  workflow_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  ai_response JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_logs_created_at ON workflow_logs(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_workflow_logs_workflow_name ON workflow_logs(workflow_name);

-- Optional: Create a view for enriched contacts
CREATE VIEW enriched_contacts AS
SELECT 
  id,
  data-&gt;&gt;'email' as email,
  data-&gt;&gt;'name' as name,
  data-&gt;&gt;'company' as company,
  ai_response as enrichment_data,
  created_at
FROM workflow_logs
WHERE workflow_name = 'AI Contact Enrichment'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**To run this SQL:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL above and click "Run"

### Step 3: Configure Supabase Credentials in n8n
1. Go to **Settings** → **Credentials**
2. Click **Add Credential** → **Supabase API**
3. Enter your Supabase URL and API key (found in Project Settings → API)
4. Name it `Supabase API`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Activate the Webhook
1. Import this workflow into n8n
2. Click the **Activate** toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click on the "Webhook Trigger" node
4. Copy the **Production URL** (this is your webhook endpoint)
5. Save this URL for integration with your applications

### Step 5: Test the Workflow
Send a test POST request to the webhook:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/contact-enrichment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@acmecorp.com",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "company": "Acme Corporation",
    "linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }'
```

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "workflow": "AI Contact Enrichment",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-14T12:00:00.000Z"

## 🎯 Customization Tips

### Enhance AI Prompts for Better Enrichment

Modify the "Prepare AI Request" node to customize enrichment:

```javascript
// Enhanced prompt for contact enrichment
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert sales intelligence analyst. 
Analyze the provided contact information and generate a comprehensive enrichment including:

1. INFERRED DETAILS: Fill in missing information based on available data
   - Full job title and seniority level
   - Department and reporting structure
   - Years of experience (estimated)
   - Professional background

2. COMPANY INSIGHTS: If company name provided
   - Industry and sub-industry
   - Company size and revenue (estimated)
   - Key products/services
   - Recent news or developments

3. BUYER PERSONA: Create a detailed profile
   - Primary responsibilities
   - Likely pain points and challenges
   - Key priorities and goals
   - Decision-making authority
   - Budget influence level

4. ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY: Provide outreach recommendations
   - Best communication channels
   - Optimal outreach timing
   - Key talking points
   - Personalization suggestions
   - Content interests

5. LEAD SCORE: Rate 1-10 based on:
   - Fit for product/service (specify your ICP)
   - Seniority and decision power
   - Company size and maturity
   - Engagement potential

Return as structured JSON with clear sections.`;

const userMessage = `Contact Information:\n${JSON.stringify($json.data, null, 2)}`;

const aiConfig = {
  provider: $env.AI_PROVIDER || 'openai',
  apiKey: $env.AI_API_KEY,
  model: $env.AI_MODEL || 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
  endpoint: $env.AI_ENDPOINT,
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
    { role: 'user', content: userMessage }
  ]
};

return { json: { aiConfig, data: $json } };
```

### Add External Data Sources

Enhance enrichment with third-party APIs:

**After "Process Data" node, add:**

1. **Clearbit/Hunter.io Node**: Get verified company data
2. **LinkedIn API**: Pull professional information
3. **Company Database**: Query internal customer data
4. **Web Scraping**: Extract data from company websites

**Then merge all data before AI enrichment for best results**

### Connect to Your CRM

Auto-update contacts after enrichment:

**Salesforce Integration:**
```javascript
// Add after "Call AI API" node
// Update Salesforce contact with enriched data
const enrichedData = JSON.parse($json.ai_response);
return {
  json: {
    contactId: $json.data.salesforce_id,
    updates: {
      Description: enrichedData.buyer_persona,
      Custom_Score__c: enrichedData.lead_score,
      Pain_Points__c: enrichedData.pain_points
    }
  }
};
```

**HubSpot Integration:**
- Add **HubSpot** node to update contact properties
- Map enriched fields to custom HubSpot properties

**Pipedrive Integration:**
- Use **Pipedrive** node to update person records
- Add custom fields for AI insights

### Implement Lead Scoring

Add scoring logic after enrichment:

```javascript
// Calculate lead score based on enrichment
const enrichment = JSON.parse($json.ai_response);

let score = 0;

// Job title scoring
if (enrichment.seniority === 'C-Level') score += 30;
else if (enrichment.seniority === 'VP/Director') score += 20;
else if (enrichment.seniority === 'Manager') score += 10;

// Company size scoring
if (enrichment.company_size === 'Enterprise') score += 25;
else if (enrichment.company_size === 'Mid-Market') score += 15;

// Decision authority scoring
if (enrichment.decision_authority === 'High') score += 25;
else if (enrichment.decision_authority === 'Medium') score += 15;

// Budget influence
if (enrichment.budget_influence === 'Direct') score += 20;

return { json: { ...enrichment, lead_score: score } };
```

### Add Compliance Checks

Insert before AI processing:

```javascript
// Check for opt-out or compliance flags
const email = $json.email.toLowerCase();

// Check against suppression list
const suppressedDomains = ['competitor.com', 'spam.com'];
const domain = email.split('@')[1];

if (suppressedDomains.includes(domain)) {
  throw new Error('Contact on suppression list');
}

// Verify email format
const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid email format');
}

return { json: $json };
```

### Batch Enrichment

Process multiple contacts:

1. Add **Spreadsheet File** trigger instead of webhook
2. Add **Split In Batches** node (process 10-20 at a time)
3. Run enrichment for each contact
4. Combine results and export to CSV

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Enrichment is too generic"
- **Solution**: Provide more input data (company, job title, LinkedIn)
- Use GPT-4 or Claude models for better inference
- Enhance the system prompt with specific instructions

**Issue**: "AI_API_KEY is undefined"
- **Solution**: Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: "Enrichment contradicts actual data"
- **Solution**: AI makes inferences - always validate critical information
- Add validation step to check enriched data against known facts
- Use external APIs for verification

**Issue**: "Too slow for real-time use"
- **Solution**: Implement queue system for async processing
- Use faster models (gpt-3.5-turbo) for speed
- Process in batches during off-peak hours

**Issue**: "Supabase credentials not found"
- **Solution**: Check credential name matches exactly: "Supabase API"
- Verify Supabase URL and API key are correct

### Debugging Tips
1. Test with known contacts first to validate accuracy
2. Compare AI enrichment against actual data
3. Check execution logs for API errors
4. Start with minimal prompt, then enhance gradually
5. Use "Execute Node" to test individual steps

## 📊 Analyzing Enriched Data

Query and analyze your enriched contacts:

```sql
-- Get all enriched contacts
SELECT * FROM enriched_contacts
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Find high-value leads (assuming scoring implemented)
SELECT 
  email,
  name,
  company,
  ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score' as score
FROM enriched_contacts
WHERE (ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score')::int &gt; 70
ORDER BY (ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score')::int DESC;

-- Analyze enrichment by company
SELECT 
  data-&gt;&gt;'company' as company,
  COUNT(*) as contact_count,
  AVG((ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score')::int) as avg_score
FROM workflow_logs
WHERE workflow_name = 'AI Contact Enrichment'
  AND ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score' IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY data-&gt;&gt;'company'
ORDER BY contact_count DESC;

-- Find contacts needing follow-up
SELECT 
  email,
  name,
  ai_response-&gt;&gt;'engagement_strategy' as strategy,
  created_at
FROM enriched_contacts
WHERE created_at &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Export Enriched Data

```sql
-- Export to CSV
COPY (
  SELECT 
    data-&gt;&gt;'email' as email,
    data-&gt;&gt;'name' as name,
    data-&gt;&gt;'company' as company,
    ai_response-&gt;&gt;'job_title' as enriched_title,
    ai_response-&gt;&gt;'seniority' as seniority,
    ai_response-&gt;&gt;'lead_score' as score
  FROM workflow_logs
  WHERE workflow_name = 'AI Contact Enrichment'
) TO '/tmp/enriched_contacts.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```
