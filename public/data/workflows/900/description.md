This workflow allows you to add a datapoint to Beeminder when a new activity is added to Strava.

You can use this workflow to keep a track of your fitness activities and connect Strava with Beeminder.

If you want to keep a track of different activities like the number of hours worked in a week or the number of tasks completed, you can use the relevant node. For example, you can use the Clockify Trigger node or the Toggl Trigger node.
