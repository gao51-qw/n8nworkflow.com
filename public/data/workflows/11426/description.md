# Get top Binance Earn yields sent to Email

This workflow automates the tracking of passive income opportunities on Binance by fetching real-time Flexible Earn APY rates, calculating potential returns, and delivering a daily summary to your inbox.

Manually checking crypto savings rates is tedious. This template handles the complex authentication required by Binance (HMAC-SHA256 signing), filters through hundreds of assets to find the highest yields, and calculates exactly how much you would earn daily on a simulated capital amount.

## 👥 Who is this for?
- **Crypto Investors** looking to maximize passive income on idle assets.
- **DeFi/CeFi Analysts** monitoring market rate fluctuations.
- **Hodlers** who want to ensure their assets are generating the best possible yield without daily manual checks.

## ⚙️ How it works
1. **Schedule Trigger:** Initiates the workflow every 24 hours (customizable).
2. **Authentication Handler:** Generates a timestamp and creates a secure HMAC-SHA256 signature required by the Binance API.
3. **Data Fetching:** specific HTTP Request retrieves the full list of "Flexible Earn" products.
4. **Processing:** The workflow splits the data, standardizes field names, and sorts all assets by **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** in descending order.
5. **Analysis:** It limits the list to the top 15 assets and calculates estimated daily earnings based on a $10,000 reference capital (customizable via code).
6. **Reporting:** A formatted HTML email is sent via Gmail with the top opportunities.

## 🛠️ Setup Guide
1. **Binance API:** Log in to Binance and create a Read-Only API Key.
2. **Configure Nodes:**
   - Open the **Set Credentials 1** node: Paste your `API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` in each field.
3. **Email Setup:**
   - Open the **Send Email** node.
   - Select or connect your Gmail credentials.
   - Update the "To" address to your email.

## 🔌 Requirements
- An active Binance account.
- Binance API Key & Secret (Read-Only permissions are sufficient).
- A Gmail account (or you can swap the Gmail node for Outlook/Slack/Telegram).

## 🎨 How to customize
- **Change Capital Calculation:** Open the "Filter & Analyze" Code node and change `const capital = 10000;` to your actual portfolio size to see real projected earnings.
- **Filter Assets:** Add an `If` node after the "Split Out" node to only filter for specific assets (e.g., USDT, BTC, ETH) if you don't want to see altcoins.
- **Change Frequency:** Open the "Daily Trigger" node to run this hourly or weekly.
