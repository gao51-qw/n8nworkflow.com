  "description": "🔗 Slack + Bitly UTM Generator — Powered by OpenAI\n\nDescription:\n\nThis no-code n8n workflow transforms how marketing teams generate Bitly links with UTM parameters — directly from Slack. Powered by AI and fully automated, this system extracts relevant campaign data from a Slack message, creates a clean Bitly shortlink with UTM tags, and logs everything to a Google Sheet for tracking and reporting.\n\nPerfect for growth marketers, content teams, and anyone tired of manually building UTM-tagged links.\n\nIf you like to follow step-by-step build of workflows like these, check out:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Automatewithmarc\n\n⚙️ How It Works\n🟢 Slack Trigger\nThe workflow starts when a user mentions the bot in a Slack channel (e.g., @BitlyBot link this for IG campaign).\n\n🧠 AI Agent (LangChain)\n\nUses GPT-4o-mini to infer UTM values (e.g., utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign)\n\nNormalizes short forms like \"IG\" to \"instagram\"\n\nFollows UTM naming conventions (e.g., lowercase, underscore-separated)\n\n🔍 Information Extractor\nPulls cleanly structured UTM data from the AI response to prep for Bitly.\n\n🔗 Bitly Tool Node\nGenerates a short link using the inferred target URL + UTM values.\n\n📋 Google Sheets Logger\nAutomatically appends the full details (Bitly link, UTM parameters, campaign owner) to a Google Sheet for easy access.\n\n📢 Slack Response\nReplies in-thread with the new Bitly link and campaign details, formatted clearly for the user.\n\n🛑 Error Handling\nIf Bitly link generation fails, the workflow gracefully stops with an error message.\n\n🔧 Tools & Services Used\nSlack (Trigger + Response)\n\nLangChain AI Agent (with GPT-4o-mini)\n\nBitly (via Bitly Tool Node)\n\nGoogle Sheets (auto-log generated links)\n\nOpenAI GPT-4o-mini (Language model for prompt understanding)\n\n💡 Use Cases\n🔗 Instantly create UTM-tagged links for campaigns\n\n📊 Maintain a central Bitly + UTM link database in Google Sheets\n\n🧠 Use AI to reduce manual tagging and formatting errors\n\n🤝 Empower your team to request links via Slack, no forms needed\n\n✅ Setup Instructions\nSlack:\nSet up a Slack bot and connect it using Slack Trigger and Slack response nodes.\nBitly API:\nGenerate a Bitly access token and set up credentials in the Bitly node.\nOpenAI / LangChain:\nConnect your GPT-4o or GPT-4 API key to the OpenAI Chat Model nodes.\nGoogle Sheets:\nUse OAuth2 credentials to connect to your Google Sheet.\nMake sure the sheet has matching columns for UTM parameters (sample headers included in the node schema).\n\n\n",
