  "description": "# Convert Reddit threads into short vertical videos with AI\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n- **Content creators** and **video editors** automating short-form content production\n- **Reddit storytellers** converting text posts into engaging TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Reels\n- **Social media managers** repurposing community discussions into visual narratives\n\n## What problem is this solving?\n\nManually converting Reddit posts into vertical video content is time-consuming:\n- You have to read, summarize, write a script\n- Generate TTS\n- Find stock footage\n- Edit everything in a timeline\n\nThis workflow automates the full pipeline. It converts any Reddit thread into a polished video with:\n- TTS narration\n- Subtitle overlays\n- B-roll from Pexels\n- Automatic rendering via Shotstack\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow:\n1. **Extracts Reddit post and comments** via Reddit API\n2. **Summarizes the thread into structured clips** using OpenAI\n3. **Generates search queries** for each clip for stock footage\n4. **Queries Pexels API** for relevant vertical videos\n5. **Generates TTS audio** for each clip using OpenAI Whisper\n6. **Creates subtitles** matching the audio\n7. **Uploads footage/audio to Shotstack**\n8. **Renders a full vertical video (720x1280)** with synced TTS, subtitles, and b-roll\n9. **Returns a final video URL**\n\n## Setup\n\n- Create accounts and API keys for:\n  - [Reddit Developer App](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)\n  - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)\n  - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/)\n  - [Shotstack](https://shotstack.io/)\n- Add credentials in n8n:\n  - Reddit (HTTP Basic Auth)\n  - OpenAI (API Key)\n  - Shotstack (HTTP Header Auth)\n  - Pexels (HTTP Header Auth)\n- Trigger via webhook or manual node. The input must include:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"voice\": \"nova\",\n    \"ttsSpeed\": 1,\n    \"videoLength\": 60,\n    \"redditLink\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/example_id/example_title\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n\n- **Tweak OpenAI prompts** to change tone or clip granularity\n- **Change stock source** by swapping Pexels for another API\n- **Adjust TTS voices** or languages by modifying the `voice` field\n- **Modify video styling** (fonts, colors, fit modes) in the timeline construction code node\n- **Control duration** by editing the character length formula in the `Limit comments length` node\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- All stock videos are selected to match clip themes using generalized keywords to avoid API misses\n- Includes `wait` nodes to ensure Shotstack's async upload/render processes complete before proceeding\n- Annotated with **sticky notes** explaining major sections like TTS, Reddit input, and media timeline\n- Avoids community nodes to ensure cloud compatibility\n\n## Template Category\n**AI**, **Marketing**, **Building Blocks**, **Other (Content Creation)**\n",
