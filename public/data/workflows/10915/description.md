## About This Template
This workflow automatically fetches the Nikkei 225 closing price every weekday and sends a formatted message to a list of users on LINE.

This is perfect for individuals or teams who need to track the market's daily performance without manual data checking.

## How It Works
1.  **Schedule Trigger:** Runs the workflow automatically every weekday at 4 PM JST (Tokyo time), just after the market closes.
2.  **Get Data:** An HTTP Request node fetches the latest Nikkei 225 data (closing price, change, %) from a data API.
3.  **Prepare Payload:** A Code node formats this data into a user-friendly message and prepares the JSON payload for the LINE Messaging API, including a list of user IDs.
4.  **Send to LINE:** An HTTP Request node sends the formatted message to all specified users via the LINE multicast API endpoint.

## Who It’s For
* Anyone who wants to receive daily stock market alerts.
* Teams that need to share financial data internally.
* Developers looking for a simple example of an API-to-LINE workflow.

## Requirements
* An n8n account.
* A LINE Official Account & Messaging API access token.
* An API endpoint to get Nikkei 225 data. (The one in the template is a temporary example).

## Setup Steps
1.  **Add LINE Credentials:** In the "Send to LINE via HTTP" node, edit the "Authorization" header to include your own LINE Messaging API Bearer Token.
2.  **Add User IDs:** In the "Prepare LINE API Payload" (Code) node, edit the `userIds` array to add all the LINE User IDs you want to send messages to.
3.  **Update Data API:** The URL in the "Get Nikkei 225 Data" node is a temporary example. Replace it with your own persistent API URL (e.g., from a public provider or your own server).

## Customization Options
* **Change Schedule:** Edit the "Every Weekday at 4 PM JST" node to run at a different time. (Note: 4 PM JST is 07:00 UTC, which is what the Cron `0 7 * * 1-5` means).
* **Change Message Format:** Edit the `message` variable inside the "Prepare LINE API Payload" (Code) node to change the text of the LINE message.
