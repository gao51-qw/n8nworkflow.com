## How it works
This workflow automatically generates a new haiku poem every morning using AI, formats it in 5-7-5 structure, saves it to Google Docs, and sends it to your email inbox.

**Workflow steps:**
1. **Schedule Trigger** – Runs daily at 7:00 AM.
2. **AI Agent** – Asks AI to output four words (*kigo*, *noun*, *verb1*, *verb2*) in JSON format.
3. **Code in JavaScript** – Builds a 5-7-5 haiku using the AI-generated words and sets today’s title.
4. **Edit Fields** – Prepares document fields (title and body) for Google Docs.
5. **Create a document** – Creates a new Google Document for the haiku.
6. **Prepare Append** – Collects the document ID and haiku text for appending.
7. **Update a document** – Inserts the haiku into the existing Google Doc.
8. **Send a message** – Sends the haiku of the day to your Gmail inbox.
9. **OpenRouter Chat Model** – Connects the OpenRouter model used by the AI Agent.
