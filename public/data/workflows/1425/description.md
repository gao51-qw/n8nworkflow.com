This telegram bot is designed to send one random recipe a day. 

This specific bot has filtered out only vegan recipes, so you can choose your diet type and send only recipes for a specific diet. 

What credentials you need:
- Set up a [telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
- Airtable for listing who has joined your bot. This is needed to send one random recipe a day.
- Recipe (or other) API.  This one uses [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

I hope you enjoy your bot!
