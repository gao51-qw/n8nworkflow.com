# **Domain Outbound Machine: Automate Lead Generation, Email Extraction, and Targeted Outreach with n8n**

## **Description**  
**Domain Outbound Machine** is an n8n workflow designed to fully automate the domain sales process: lead generation, email extraction, personalized outreach, and automated email sending. It also stores extracted email addresses and sent emails in an Excel file for tracking and follow-up.

## **How It Works?**

### **1. Domain Input**  
You provide the domain name you want to sell. The workflow takes this domain as the starting point.

### **2. Google Maps Query Generation**  
The workflow automatically generates 100 Google Maps queries based on the domain's niche or industry. This ensures you target businesses or individuals who might be interested in acquiring the domain.

### **3. Web Scraping for Emails**  
Using the generated queries, the workflow scrapes relevant websites to extract email addresses. This step ensures you have a targeted list of potential buyers.

### **4. Email Enrichment**  
For each extracted email, the workflow gathers publicly available information (e.g., LinkedIn, company websites) to enhance personalization.

### **5. Personalized Email Creation**  
Based on the enriched data, the workflow crafts a custom email for each lead, emphasizing the domain’s value, its relevance to their business, and a compelling call-to-action.

### **6. Email Sending via Gmail**  
The workflow sends the personalized emails directly through your Gmail account, ensuring timely and professional outreach.

### **7. Email & Lead Tracking in Excel**  
All extracted email addresses and sent messages are automatically stored in an Excel file, allowing you to track responses and manage follow-ups efficiently.
