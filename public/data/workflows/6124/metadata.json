It also transforms the country field to the associated country code (i.e. \"Deutschland\" -&gt; \"DE\")\n\n### The if node\nThis node checks if there is an \"EchtPost\" tag in the persons data.\n-&gt; if false: do nothing\n-&gt; if true: go to HTTP request\n\n### The HTTP Request\nThis node sends the persons name, address and country code alongside with the id of the EchtPost template (inserted manually in the node) to EchtPost. It also needs an E-Mail-Adress for a confirmation mail.\n\nThe data starts a \"Mail in 3 days\" process with the EchtPost service, which mails a postcard with that template to the person.\n\n## Preconditions \nFor this workflow, you need:\n* a CentralStationCRM account with API access\n* an EchtPost account with API access\n* an EchtPost template, with a message, and the templates ID",
