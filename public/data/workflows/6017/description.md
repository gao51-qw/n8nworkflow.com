This workflow creates a smart, AI-powered customer support agent using Grok-4 that can answer questions based on a preloaded Google Doc knowledge base. It listens for incoming customer queries via Telegram, then uses Grok-4’s language reasoning + memory features to generate helpful responses pulled directly from the doc.
