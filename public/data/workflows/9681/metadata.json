  "description": "## 📘 Description:\nThis workflow automates end-to-end validation, assessment, and reporting of n8n workflow JSON templates using Google Drive, Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, Gmail, and Slack.\nIt retrieves workflows from a Drive folder, validates their integrity, analyzes their quality against official n8n Template Publishing Guidelines, generates a structured report, converts it into a formatted .txt file, and archives it with instant notifications sent via Slack and email.\nIt ensures a fully autonomous review cycle for workflow publishing, complete with error tracking, AI-based evaluations, and automated reporting.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n▶️ When Clicking ‘Execute Workflow’ (Manual Trigger)\n Initiates the validation pipeline manually, allowing users to start the batch evaluation process on demand.\n\n📂 Fetch Workflow Files from Drive\n Retrieves all JSON workflow files from the “n8n json checker” Google Drive folder, including their metadata (ID, name, timestamps).\n Acts as the primary input source for the validation loop.\n\n🔄 Process Files One by One\n Splits the list of files into individual items to ensure controlled, sequential processing.\n Prevents API overload and maintains order during AI evaluation.\n\n⬇️ Download Workflow JSON File\n Fetches each workflow file from Drive using its file ID.\n Ensures a complete, uncorrupted copy before validation begins.\n\n🔍 Validate File Download Success (IF Node)\n Checks if the downloaded file includes a valid id and JSON structure.\n ✅ True Path: Continues to parsing and analysis.\n ❌ False Path: Logs the failed file to a Google Sheet for audit and debugging.\n\n🧾 Parse JSON Workflow Structure\n Converts raw JSON files into object data structures readable by AI.\n Verifies JSON syntax and schema readiness for further evaluation.\n\n🧠 GPT-4o Language Model Configuration\n Initializes Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o as the reasoning engine for advanced workflow quality analysis.\n\n🗂 Conversation Context Buffer\n Maintains contextual memory across multiple files, enabling GPT-4o to stay consistent across batch validations and apply uniform judgment standards.\n\n🤖 AI-Powered Workflow Quality Analyzer\n Uses GPT-4o to evaluate each workflow against eight defined quality checkpoints:\n 1️⃣ JSON Validity\n 2️⃣ Documentation Presence\n 3️⃣ Security & Credentials\n 4️⃣ Node Naming Standards\n 5️⃣ Workflow Validity\n 6️⃣ Originality & Usefulness\n 7️⃣ Industry-Readiness\n 8️⃣ Visual Presentation\n\nProduces a structured JSON output summarizing each checkpoint’s result, reason, and overall assessment.\n\n🧩 Format AI Response to JSON Schema\n Normalizes GPT-4o output into a clean JSON schema for easy parsing.\n Ensures consistency across all AI-generated reports.\n\n📝 Generate Human-Readable Report\n Transforms structured JSON results into a formatted plain-text report with headers, dividers, and human-friendly phrasing.\n Provides an executive-style summary of workflow quality.\n\n📋 Convert Report to Text File Format\n Converts the formatted analysis into a .txt file suitable for archival.\n Preserves visual layout and divider styles for readability.\n\n☁️ Archive Validation Report to Drive\n Uploads the finalized text report to the “EOD Updates report” Google Drive folder.\n Automatically names files with a timestamp (e.g., workflow_report_2025-11-03_103020.txt) for easy tracking.\n\n📧 Email Detailed Report to Stakeholders\n Sends an HTML-formatted email summary including report metadata: file name, size, type, created time, and owner.\n Includes “View in Drive” and “Download” buttons for quick access.\n\n💬 Send Validation Summary to Slack\n Notifies internal teams with a Slack message summarizing the workflow’s assessment result, report name, size, and links to Drive resources.\n Ensures real-time transparency for the QA team.\n\n⚠️ Log Failed Downloads to Error Sheet\n Captures download or validation errors in a dedicated Google Sheet.\n Supports quick debugging and failure traceability across runs.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\nGoogle Drive OAuth connection (Techdome Account)\nAzure OpenAI GPT-4o credentials\nGmail and Slack API integrations\nGoogle Sheets connection for error tracking\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✅ Fully automated n8n workflow review and quality assurance pipeline\n ✅ Structured GPT-4o analysis aligned with official publishing standards\n ✅ Instant report archival and real-time notifications\n ✅ Built-in error logging and recovery tracking\n ✅ Reduces manual review workload by over 90%\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\nn8n Template Publishers & Marketplace Moderators\nQA Engineers validating workflow submissions\nAutomation Teams managing template quality and compliance\nOrganizations maintaining standardized workflow repositories\n\n",
