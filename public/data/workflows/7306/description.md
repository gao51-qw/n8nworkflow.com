### 📩 

This n8n automation sends a **personalized email** to the person who booked a meeting via **Calendly**. It uses an **AI agent** to craft a helpful, human-sounding HTML email that includes your fake phone number (`111-111-1111`) and the meeting date.

### 📌 What This Workflow Does

1. **Triggers** when someone books a meeting in Calendly (`invitee.created` event).
2. **Extracts** user details like name, email, reason for meeting, and scheduled time.
3. **Uses OpenAI** to generate a custom email response based on what the user shared.
4. **Sends the email** to the user using Microsoft Outlook.
