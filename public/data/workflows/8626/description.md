## How it works

This workflow automatically creates daily AI-generated videos for any niche.  
It generates a short script, converts it into a cinematic video prompt, and produces an 8-second video with Veo 3.  
The workflow waits for the video, downloads it, and sends it via Gmail with a ready-to-post social media description.  
You can customize the script prompt to match any industry or topic.
