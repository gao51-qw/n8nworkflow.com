# 🎥 Auto-Save Zoom Recordings to Google Drive + Log Meetings in Airtable

This workflow automatically saves **Zoom meeting recordings** to **Google Drive** and logs all important details into **Airtable** for easy tracking. Perfect for teams that want a searchable meeting archive.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Zoom Recording Webhook**  
   - Listens for `recording.completed` events from Zoom.  
   - Captures metadata (Meeting ID, Topic, Host, File Type, File Size, etc.).  

2. **Normalize Recording Data**  
   - A Code node extracts and formats Zoom payload into clean JSON.  

3. **Download Recording**  
   - Uses HTTP Request to download the recording file.  

4. **Upload to Google Drive**  
   - Saves the recording into your chosen Google Drive folder.  
   - Returns the file ID and share link.  

5. **Log Result**  
   - Combines Zoom metadata with Google Drive file info.  

6. **Save to Airtable**  
   - Logs all details into your `Meeting Logs` table:  
     - Meeting ID  
     - Topic  
     - Host  
     - File Type  
     - File Size  
     - Google Drive Saved (Yes/No)  
     - Drive Link  
     - Timestamp
