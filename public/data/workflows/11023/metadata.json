  "description": "**Stop manually searching Google for sales leads. Start listening to the internet.**\n\nThis advanced workflow automatically identifies, qualifies, and enriches high-value leads by searching for their **digital footprints** (i.e., specific technology use or public directories). It uses a robust **Find/Create/Conditional Update** database pattern to prevent duplicates and ensure you only spend credits on enriching incomplete records.\n\nThe workflow provides a fully persistent lead record, updating the same Airtable row as new data is found across multiple search steps.\n\n### ✨ Key Features\n\n  * **Persistent Data Integrity:** Uses a dedicated **Loop Over Items** structure to run the Find/Create/Update logic sequentially for every lead, guaranteeing no data is lost or duplicated.\n  * **Conditional Enrichment:** A smart gate checks the Airtable record: if the high-value email field is empty, the workflow proceeds to the expensive scraping steps. If it is already complete, it skips the scrape.\n  * **Targeted Scraping:** Executes precise **Google Dorks** (via Decodo) to find initial leads and then targets the specific **Contact Us page** for deep email extraction.\n  * **Database-as-a-State-Machine:** Airtable acts as the single source of truth, logging the initial lead status and updating the same row across several enrichment phases.\n  * **Final Output:** Delivers the fully enriched lead data (Domain, Primary Email, Contact Page URL) to a final notification channel.\n\n-----\n\n### ⚙️ How it Works (The Find/Create/Update Loop)\n\n1.  **Search & Filter:** The workflow is manually triggered and uses the **Config** variables to execute a wide-scope Google Search via **Decodo**. The results are filtered into a clean array of unique domains.\n2.  **Loop & Check:** The **Loop Over Items** node starts. Inside, the **Airtable Read** node checks the database for the current lead's domain.\n3.  **Create/Update:**\n      * If the lead is **NEW**, the workflow creates a record (`Airtable: Create Lead`).\n      * If the lead **EXISTS**, the record is updated (`Airtable: Update Lead`).\n4.  **Data Merger:** The **Data Merger: ID Finalizer** node consolidates the workflow, ensuring the unique Airtable Record ID is passed to the next step, regardless of whether the lead was created or updated.\n5.  **Conditional Enrichment:** The **If: Enrichment Needed?** node checks the existing `Primary Email` status. If it's empty, the item proceeds to the deep scraping pipeline (`Decodo: Email Search` → `Decodo: Scrape Contact Page`).\n6.  **Final Update:** The final node updates the Airtable record with the high-quality email address found from the deep scrape.\n\n---\n\n### 📥 Decodo Node Installation\n\nThe Decodo node is used three times in this workflow for precision scraping and searching.\n\n1.  **Find the Node:** Click the **+** button in your n8n canvas.\n2.  **Search:** Search for the **`Decodo`** node and select it.\n3.  **Credentials:** When configuring the first Decodo node, use your API key (obtained with the 80% discount coupon).\n-----\n\n### 🎁 Exclusive Deal for n8n Users\n\nTo run this workflow, you require a robust scraping provider. We have secured a massive discount for Decodo users:\n\n  * **Get 80% OFF** the **23k Advanced Scraping API** plan.\n  * **Coupon Code:** `ATTAN8N`\n  * **Sign Up Here:** [**Claim 80% Discount on Decodo**](https://visit.decodo.com/c/6679292/3071239/17480)\n-----\n\n### 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\nThis template requires specific node configuration and Airtable fields.\n\n1.  **Credentials:** Obtain API keys for **Decodo** (using the coupon above) and **Airtable**.\n2.  **Airtable Setup (Schema):** Create an Airtable base with a 'Leads' table. It must include these fields for mapping:\n      * `Domain` (Single Line Text - Primary Field)\n      * `Primary Email` (Email)\n      * `Contact Page URL` (URL)\n      * `Source URL` (URL)\n      * `Lead Type` (Single Select: *Paid Ad Lead, Organic Lead*)\n      * `Status` (Single Select: *New Lead, Updated, Enrichment Complete*)\n3.  **Global Configuration:** Open the **`Config: Set Search Params`** node. Customize the following fields:\n      * `tech_footprint`: e.g., `\"We use Klaviyo\"`\n      * `target_industry`: e.g., `site:promarketer.ca`\n\n-----\n\n### ➕ How to Adapt the Template\n\n* **Change Database:** Replace the **Airtable** nodes with **Postgres**, **Notion**, or **Google Sheets** for logging, adapting the field mappings.\n* **Final Notification:** Add a **Slack** or **Gmail** node to alert the sales team immediately upon successful enrichment.\n* **Multi-Step Enrichment:** Integrate a service like Hunter.io or Clearbit to find key employee names and titles before the final database update.\n* **Adjust Scoring:** Add an **If Node** after the deep scrape to set a *Lead Score* based on whether a direct email (`sales@`) was found versus a general contact page link.\n* **Add AI Lead Scoring:** Integrate a **Gemini** or **OpenAI** node after the deep scraping step to assign an \"AI Score\" (1-100) based on lead quality (e.g., domain authority, quality of the extracted email), before the final update.",
