🤖📈 This workflow is **my personal solution** for the **Agentic Arena Community Contest**, where the goal is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent capable of answering questions based on a provided PDF knowledge base.


---

### Key Advantages

* ✅ **End-to-End RAG Implementation**
  Fully automates the ingestion, processing, and retrieval of knowledge from PDFs into a vector database.

* ✅ **Accuracy through Multi-Layered Retrieval**
  Combines embeddings, Qdrant search, and Cohere reranking to ensure the agent retrieves the most relevant policy information.

* ✅ **Robust Evaluation System**
  Includes an automated correctness evaluation pipeline powered by GPT-4.1 as a judge, ensuring transparent scoring and continuous improvement.

* ✅ **Citation-Driven Compliance**
  The AI agent is instructed to provide **citations for every answer**, making it suitable for high-stakes use cases like policy compliance.

* ✅ **Scalability and Modularity**
  Can easily integrate with different data sources (Google Drive, APIs, other storage systems) and be extended to new use cases.

* ✅ **Seamless Collaboration with Google Sheets**
  Both the evaluation set and the results are integrated with Google Sheets, enabling easy monitoring, iteration, and reporting.

* ✅ **Cloud and Self-Hosted Flexibility**
  Works with self-hosted **Qdrant** on Hetzner, Mistral Cloud for OCR, and OpenAI/Cohere APIs, combining local control with powerful cloud AI services.

### **How it Works**

1.  **Knowledge Base Ingestion (The "Setup" Execution):**
    *   When started manually, the workflow first clears an existing Qdrant vector database collection.
    *   It then searches a specified Google Drive folder for PDF files. For each PDF found, it performs the following steps:
        *   **Uploads the file** to the Mistral AI API.
        *   **Processes the PDF** using Mistral's OCR service to extract text and convert it into a structured markdown format.
        *   **Splits the text** into manageable chunks.
        *   **Generates embeddings** for each text chunk using OpenAI's model.
        *   **Stores the embeddings** in the Qdrant vector store, creating a searchable knowledge base.

2.  **Agent Evaluation (The "Testing" Execution):**
    *   The workflow is triggered by an evaluation Google Sheet containing questions and correct answers.
    *   For each question, the core **AI Agent** is activated. This agent:
        *   Uses the **RAG tool** to search the pre-populated Qdrant vector store for relevant information from the PDFs.
        *   Employs a **Cohere reranker** to refine the search results for the highest quality context.
        *   Leverages a **GPT-4.1 model** to generate an answer based strictly on the retrieved context.
    *   The agent's answer is then passed to an **"LLM as a Judge"** (another GPT-4.1 instance), which compares it to the ground truth answer from the evaluation sheet.
    *   The judge provides a detailed score (1-5) based on factual correctness and citation accuracy.
    *   Finally, both the agent's answer and the correctness score are saved back to a Google Sheet for review.

### **Set up Steps**

To implement this solution, you need to configure the following components and credentials:

1.  **Configure Core AI Services:**
    *   **OpenAI API Credentials:** Required for the main AI agent, the judge LLM, and generating embeddings.
    *   **Mistral AI API Credentials:** Necessary for the OCR service that processes PDF files.
    *   **Cohere API Credentials:** Used for the reranker node that improves retrieval quality.
    *   **Google Service Accounts:** Set up OAuth for Google Sheets (to read questions and save results) and Google Drive (to access the PDF source files).

2.  **Set up the Vector Database (Qdrant):**
    *   This workflow uses a self-hosted Qdrant instance. You must deploy and configure your own Qdrant server.
    *   Update the **Qdrant Vector Store** and **RAG** nodes with the correct API endpoint URL and credentials for your Qdrant instance.
    *   Ensure the collection name (`agentic-arena`) is created or matches your setup.

3.  **Connect Data Sources:**
    *   **PDF Source:** In the **"Search PDFs"** node, update the `folderId` parameter to point to your own Google Drive folder containing the contest PDFs.
    *   **Evaluation Sheet:** In the **"Eval Set"** node, update the `documentId` to point to your own copy of the evaluation Google Sheet containing the test questions and answers.
    *   **Results Sheet:** In the **"Save Eval"** node, update the `documentId` to point to the Google Sheet where you want to save the evaluation results.
