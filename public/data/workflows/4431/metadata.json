  "description": "**What This Workflow Does:**\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically generates an AI-powered summary and relevant tags whenever a new row is added to your Notion database. \n\nSimply save any URL to your Notion database using the [Notion Web Clipper] Chrome extension or [Save to Notion]—on both desktop and mobile. \n\nThis keeps all your saved content organized in one place instead of scattered across different platforms.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The workflow is triggered when a new row is added to your Notion database (it checks for updates every minute).\n\n2. It retrieves the content from the saved URL.\n\n3. An AI agent analyzes the content to generate a summary and relevant tags.\n\n4. The AI output is then formatted properly.\n\n5. Finally, the formatted summary and tags are saved into the appropriate columns in your Notion database.\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\nMake sure your Notion database includes the following columns:\n\nURL – Stores the content URL you want to summarize.\n\nAI Summary – Where the AI-generated summary will be added.\n\nTags – Where the AI-generated tags will be saved.\n\n",
