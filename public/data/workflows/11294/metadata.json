  "description": "## 📘 Description\nThis workflow automates end-to-end AI-driven inventory intelligence, transforming Airtable stock data into optimized reorder recommendations, daily operational summaries, and instant Slack alerts.\n It fetches all inventory rows, validates structure, computes reorder and safety-stock metrics using strict formulas, merges multi-batch AI output into a unified dataset, and distributes actionable insights across Email and Slack.\nInvalid or corrupted Airtable rows are logged to Google Sheets for audit and cleanup.\n The workflow ensures deterministic inventory math (zero improvisation), strict JSON compliance, and reliable multi-channel reporting for operations teams.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n▶️ Manual Trigger – Start Inventory Optimization\n Runs the full optimization and reporting pipeline on demand.\n\n📦 Fetch Inventory Records from Airtable\n Retrieves all SKU records (ID, ItemName, SKU, quantities, reorder levels) from the Airtable Inventory table.\n\n🔍 Validate Inventory Record Structure (IF)\n Ensures each record contains a valid id.\n Valid → routed to AI optimization\n Invalid → saved to Google Sheets.\n\n📄 Log Invalid Inventory Rows to Google Sheet\n Captures malformed or incomplete Airtable items for audit checks and data hygiene.\n\n🧠 Configure GPT-4o — Inventory Optimization Model\n Defines the AI model for stock-level calculations using strict formulas:\nSuggestedReorderPoint = ReorderLevel × 1.2\nSuggestedSafetyStock = ReorderLevel × 0.5\n StockStatus logic:\nCritical if QuantityInStock ≤ SuggestedSafetyStock\nNeeds Reorder if QuantityInStock ≤ SuggestedReorderPoint\nOK otherwise\n\n🤖 Generate Inventory Optimization Output (AI)\n The AI engine analyzes each SKU and returns:\nSuggested reorder point\nSuggested safety stock\nUpdated stock status\nClean structured JSON for each item\n All without markdown, hallucination, or additional logic.\n\n🧩 Merge AI Optimization Results (Code)\n Consolidates all partial AI responses into one complete JSON dataset containing all SKUs.\n\n🧠 Configure GPT-4o – Email Summary Model\n Prepares the AI model used for generating a professional operations-team email.\n\n📧 Generate Inventory Email Summary (AI)\n Creates a manager-ready email including:\nHigh-level inventory health\nDetailed SKU summaries\nAlerts for low, reorder-level, or critical stock\nRecommended actions for today’s operations\n\n📨 Email Inventory Summary to Manager (Gmail)\n Sends the completed inventory summary to the operations manager.\n\n🧠 Configure GPT-4o – Slack Summary Model\n Sets up GPT-4o to produce a compact, emoji-supported Slack summary.\n\n💬 Generate Inventory Slack Summary (AI)\n Builds a Slack-optimized message containing:\nOne-line inventory health\nBullet list of SKUs with stock status\nClear alerts for reorder-level or critical items\nOne recommended action line\n\n📡 Notify Operations Team on Slack\n Delivers the optimized Slack summary to the operations Slack user/channel for real-time visibility.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n- Airtable access token\n- Azure OpenAI GPT-4o credentials\n- Google Sheets OAuth\n- Slack API credentials\n- Gmail OAuth\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ AI-powered stock calculations with strict formulas\n ✔ Reliable reorder and safety-stock predictions\n ✔ Instant multi-channel reporting (Email + Slack)\n ✔ Full audit logging for invalid data\n ✔ Zero hallucinations—pure structured JSON\n ✔ Faster decision-making for operations teams\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n- Operations & supply-chain teams\n- Inventory managers\n- Retail & e-commerce units\n- Businesses using Airtable for stock tracking\n",
