  "title": "Sync Google Sheets data with MySQL",
  "description": "This workflow performs several data integration and synchronization tasks between Google Sheets and a MySQL database.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of what this workflow does:\n\n1. Manual Trigger: The workflow starts when the user clicks \"Execute Workflow.\"\n2. Schedule Trigger: This node schedules the workflow to run at specific intervals on weekdays (Monday to Friday) between 6 AM and 10 PM. It ensures regular data synchronization.\n3. Google Sheet Data: This node connects to a specific Google Sheets document and retrieves data from the \"Form Responses 1\" sheet, filtering by the \"DB Status\" column.\n4. SQL Get inquiries from Google: This node retrieves data from a MySQL database table named \"ConcertInquiries\" where the \"source_name\" is \"GoogleForm.\"\n5. Rename GSheet variables: This node renames the columns retrieved from Google Sheets and transforms the data into a format suitable for MySQL, assigning a value for \"source_name\" as \"GoogleForm.\"\n6. Compare Datasets: This node compares the data retrieved from Google Sheets and the MySQL database based on timestamp and source_name fields. It identifies changes and updates.\n7. No reply too long?: This node checks if there has been no reply within the last four hours, using the \"timestamp\" field from the Google Sheets data.\n8. DB Status assigned?: This node checks if the \"DB Status\" field is not empty in the compared dataset.\n9. Update GSheet status: If conditions are met in the previous nodes, this node updates the \"DB Status\" field in Google Sheets with the corresponding value from the MySQL dataset.\n10. DB Status in sync?: This node checks if the \"source_name\" field in Google Sheets is not empty.\n11. Sync MySQL data: If conditions are met in the previous nodes, this node updates the \"source_name\" field in the MySQL database to \"GoogleFormSync.\"\n12. Send Notifications: If conditions are met in the \"No reply too long?\" node, this node sends notifications or performs actions as needed.\n13. Sticky Notes: These nodes provide additional information and documentation links for users.",
