This n8n template monitors active support issues in Linear.app to track the mood of their ongoing conversation between reporter and assignee using Sentiment Analysis. When sentiment dips into the negative, a notification is sent via Slack to alert the team.

## How it works
* A scheduled trigger is used to fetch recently updated issues in Linear using the GraphQL node.
* Each issue's comments thread is passed into a simple Information Extractor node to identify the overall sentiment.
* The resulting sentiment analysis combined with the some issue details are uploaded to Airtable for review.
* When the template is re-run at a later date, each issue is re-analysed for sentiment
* Each issue's new sentiment state is saved to the airtable whilst its previous state is moved to the "previous sentiment" column.
* An Airtable trigger is used to watch for recently updated rows
* Each matching Airtable row is filtered to check if it has a previous non-negative state but now has a negative state in its current sentiment.
* The results are sent via notification to a team slack channel for priority.

## How to use
* Modify the GraphQL filter to fetch issues to a relevant issue type, team or person.
* Update the Slack channel to ensure messages are sent to the correct location or persons.
* The Airtable also serves to give a snapshot of Sentiment across support tickets for a given period. It's possible to use this to assess the daily operations.

## Requirements
* Linear for issue tracking (but feel free to use another system if preferred)
* Airtable for Database
* OpenAI for LLM and Sentiment Analysis

## Customising the workflow
* Add more granular levels of sentiment to reduce the number of alerts.
* Explore different types of sentiment based on issue types and customer types. This may help prioritise alerts and response.
* Run across teams or categories of issues to get an overview of sentiment across the support organisation.
