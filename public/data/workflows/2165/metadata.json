  "description": "This workflow allows you to ask questions about a PDF document. The answers are provided by an AI model of your choice, and the answer includes a citation pointing to the information it used.\n\nYou can use n8n’s built-in chat interface to ask the questions, or you could customise this workflow to use another one (e.g. Slack, Teams, etc.)\n\n### Example\n\nThe workflow is set up with the Bitcoin whitepaper. So you could ask things like:\n\n*Question: “Which email provider does the creator of Bitcoin use?“*\n*Answer: “GMX [Bitcoin whitepaper.pdf, lines 1-35]”*\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. A Pinecone account (they have a free tier at the time of writing that is easily enough for this workflow)\n2. Access to a large language model (e.g. an OpenAI account)\n\n### Customizing this workflow\n\nThe workflow only reads in one document, but you could customise it to read in all the documents in a folder (or more).\n\nThe workflow is set up to use GPT 3.5, but you could swap that out for any other model (including self-hosted ones).",
