# Monitor Postgres Data Freshness and Email Alert If Stale
This template monitors a set of tables inside a Postgres database to ensure they're getting updated.

If the table hasn't been updated in 3 days (configurable), an email alert is sent containing the tables that are stale.

## Requirements
You must have a Postgres database containing one or more tables that you'd like to monitor.

Each table to monitor must have a date or timestamp column that tracks when data was pushed.

For example, this might be:

- A `timestamp` column if your table holds event/timeseries data
- A `last_updated` column if your rows are expected to be modified

## Usage
1. Use this template
1. Add your Postgres and email credentials
1. Adjust the `Produce tables + date columns` node to produce pairs of `[table, date_column]` that should be monitored for freshness
    - 💁‍♂️ Note that a timestamp column also works
1. (Optional) Adjust the `Remove fresh tables` node for your desired staleness window (default is 3 days, but you can adjust as you please)
1. (Optional) Customize the `Send alerts` node to call whichever alerting workflow you please (I recommend [my alerting workflow](https://creators.n8n.io/workflows/6189) for easiest plug-and-play)

## How it works
This template works by:

1. Pulling the most recent row for each table
1. Calculating how out-of-date each table is, in days
1. Dropping fresh tables that have been updated within the past 3 days
1. Sending an email alert with the stale tables that haven't been updated within the past 3 days
