  "description": "# Monitor Postgres Data Freshness and Email Alert If Stale\nThis template monitors a set of tables inside a Postgres database to ensure they're getting updated.\n\nIf the table hasn't been updated in 3 days (configurable), an email alert is sent containing the tables that are stale.\n\n## Requirements\nYou must have a Postgres database containing one or more tables that you'd like to monitor.\n\nEach table to monitor must have a date or timestamp column that tracks when data was pushed.\n\nFor example, this might be:\n\n- A `timestamp` column if your table holds event/timeseries data\n- A `last_updated` column if your rows are expected to be modified\n\n## Usage\n1. Use this template\n1. Add your Postgres and email credentials\n1. Adjust the `Produce tables + date columns` node to produce pairs of `[table, date_column]` that should be monitored for freshness\n    - 💁‍♂️ Note that a timestamp column also works\n1. (Optional) Adjust the `Remove fresh tables` node for your desired staleness window (default is 3 days, but you can adjust as you please)\n1. (Optional) Customize the `Send alerts` node to call whichever alerting workflow you please (I recommend [my alerting workflow](https://creators.n8n.io/workflows/6189) for easiest plug-and-play)\n\n## How it works\nThis template works by:\n\n1. Pulling the most recent row for each table\n1. Calculating how out-of-date each table is, in days\n1. Dropping fresh tables that have been updated within the past 3 days\n1. Sending an email alert with the stale tables that haven't been updated within the past 3 days",
