Triggered via Telegram or a scheduled interval, it generates 1,500–2,500-word articles on Technology, AI, Tech Facts, History, or Tips, complete with catchy titles, slugs, meta descriptions, and realistic featured images. Perfect for bloggers and marketers, BlogBlitz ensures your site stays fresh with high-quality content.\n\n## Who is this for?\nBloggers, content marketers, and WordPress site owners who want to automate high-quality, SEO-ready blog content creation without manual writing or formatting.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\nManually creating engaging, SEO-optimized blog posts is time-consuming and requires expertise.

Check WordPress for the published post.  \n\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Change Categories**: Update the WordPress Post Draft node to match your site’s category IDs.  \n- **Adjust Schedule**: Modify the Schedule Trigger node for different intervals (e.g., daily).  \n- **Tweak Tone**: Edit the prompt in the Basic LLM Chain node for a different writing style (e.g., formal or casual).  \n- **Add Platforms**: Extend notifications to Slack or email by adding nodes.  \n- **Image Style**: Adjust the OpenAI image node for different sizes or styles (e.g., “natural” instead of “vivid”).  \n\n## Pre-Requirements\n- **n8n Instance**: Cloud or self-hosted.  \n- **Credentials**:  \n  - WordPress API (wp-json/wp/v2 endpoint).  \n  - OpenAI API for text and images.  \n  - OpenRouter API for AI content.  \n  - Telegram bot API.  \n  - Discord Webhook API.  \n- **Dependencies**: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain` package.  \n- **WordPress Setup**: Categories and admin user ID configured.  \n- **Network**: Stable internet for API calls.  \n\n---\n*Made by: [Khaisa Studio](https://khaisa.studio)*  \n*Tag: youtube, summarizer, telegram, openai*  \n*Category: AI Automation, Video Tools*\nNeed a custom? **[Contact Me](https://khmuhtadin.com)**",
