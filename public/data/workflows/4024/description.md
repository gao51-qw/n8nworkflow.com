## What this workflow does
- **Triggers**: Runs every 3 hours via a Schedule Trigger or on-demand with a Telegram command (“generate”).  
- **Generates Content**: Uses OpenRouter to pick a category (e.g., Technology, AI) and create a title, slug, focus keyphrase, and meta description.  
- **Writes Articles**: OpenAI crafts 1,500–2,500-word posts with SEO-friendly structure, headings, and a call-to-action.  
- **Adds Visuals**: Generates realistic featured images with OpenAI and uploads them to WordPress.  
- **SEO Features**: Generate optimized slug, focus keyphrase, meta description
- **Publishes**: Posts articles to WordPress with proper categories and featured images.  
- **Notifies**: Sends publish alerts with links to Discord and Telegram.
