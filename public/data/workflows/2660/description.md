## How it works
This workflow provides a streamlined process for uploading files to Digital Ocean Spaces, making them publicly accessible. The process happens in three main steps:

1. User submits the form with file, in this case I needed it to upload images I use in my seo tags.
2. File is automatically uploaded to Digital Ocean Spaces using S3-compatible storage
3. Form completion confirmation is provided

## Setup steps
* Initial setup typically takes 5-10 minutes
* Configure your Digital Ocean Spaces credentials and bucket settings
* Test the upload functionality with a small sample file
* Verify public access permissions are working as expected

## Important notes
* Credentials are tricky check the screenshot above for how I set the url, bucket etc.
* I am just using the S3 Node
* Set the ACL as seen below

## Troubleshooting
* Bucket name might be incorrect
* Region Wrong
* Check Space permissions if uploads fail
* Verify API credentials are correctly configured
