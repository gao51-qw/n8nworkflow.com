## How it works
- creates a new page in Confluence based on a page template also defined in Confluence
- replaces any number of placeholders with data from your workflow
- generic implementation for maximum flexibility

## Set up steps
- All parameters you need to change are defined in the Set node
	- Set your Atlassian-domain
	- Set the template id you want to use as the basis for new pages
	- Set the target space and parent page for new pages added based on that template.
