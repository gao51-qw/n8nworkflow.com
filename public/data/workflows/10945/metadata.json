  "description": "# AI-Powered Discord Task Manager with Priority Intelligence\nMission-Aligned Task Tracker: Discord + AI + Google Sheets\n\n### Opening Summary\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to automate task management by syncing tasks from a Discord channel to Google Sheets, enriching them with AI-driven prioritization, and delivering a daily prioritized digest back to Discord. It streamlines task organization aligned with personal mission and productivity frameworks.\n\n### Use cases are many:\n* Try managing your team’s project tasks by automatically prioritizing them based on strategic goals!\n* Try personal task tracking with AI-powered prioritization for optimized daily productivity!\n* Try automating follow-ups and completed task archiving seamlessly between Discord and Google Sheets!\n\n### Good to know\n* Using OpenAI GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 mini models may incur API costs based on usage (check your OpenAI pricing plan).\n* Google Sheets API has rate limits; large task volumes may require batch adjustments to avoid quota errors.\n* Discord API OAuth2 authentication is needed with permissions to read messages, add reactions, and post messages.\n* The workflow requires shared Google Sheets with specific sheets named `Tasks` and `completed tasks` (template link provided).\n* Reaction emojis in Discord (✍️ for processed, ✅ for completed) are used to track task status within Discord.\n* AI-driven prioritization follows mission alignment based on Eisenhower Matrix, energy levels, and impact scoring. \n\n### Uses concepts from: \n- Deep work by Cal Newport\n- Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less – Greg McKeown (2014)\n- Getting Results the Agile Way – J.D. Meier\n- Hyperfocus – Chris Bailey (2018)\n- Slow Productivity – Cal Newport (2024)\nNewport’s newest book. Explicitly about doing fewer things, working at a natural pace, and obsessing over quality—basically Deep Work 2.0\n\n### How it works\n* `Schedule Trigger` fires hourly to initiate task syncing.\n* `Set discord IDs here` node defines Discord server and channel IDs for input/output.\n* `get data - tasks Channel` fetches all messages from the Discord input channel.\n* `Loop Over Items1` and `if message is recorded already` prevent reprocessing tasks.\n* `clean data` prepares message information to uniform structure.\n* `ai task organizer` node sends each task text to OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini agent, which analyzes and assigns priority, impact, energy level, category, and other metadata aligned to the user's mission.\n* Tasks are appended to Google Sheets `Tasks` sheet using `Append row in task sheet`.\n* `react to confirm` adds a reaction on Discord to mark the message as processed.\n* `Get tasks to do` retrieves all in-progress tasks from Google Sheets for daily prioritization.\n* Aggregated task data is analyzed by the `AI Agent` with GPT-5 mini to select top 6 tasks (3 high-energy, 3 low-energy).\n* The daily prioritized list is split into acceptable message sizes and sent back to a Discord output channel by `Send a message` node.\n* The workflow checks for tasks with ✅ reactions in Discord (`get checked ones`), updates their status to \"Completed\" in Google Sheets (`Update row in sheet`).\n* Completed tasks are moved to a separate `completed tasks` sheet (`move completed rows to completed sheet`) and deleted from active list (`delete completed rows`) in a loop until none remain.\n* Wait nodes and limits are used to control API call pacing and batch sizes.\n\n### How to use\n* Set your Discord server and channel IDs for input (`tasks-to-do`) and output (`my-prio-tasks-today`) in the `Set discord IDs here` node.\n* Connect your Google Sheets account and set the Spreadsheet ID in all relevant nodes (the sheet must have `Tasks` and `completed tasks` sheets with expected columns).\n* Add your OpenAI API credentials for GPT-4.1 mini (task processing) and GPT-5 mini (daily digest).\n* Ensure your Discord app has OAuth2 tokens with message read, react, and post permissions.\n* Post tasks as messages in the configured Discord input channel.\n* Run the workflow or activate it; it will sync, process, prioritize, and update tasks automatically on schedule.\n* Customize the schedule trigger if you want more frequent or different syncing intervals.\n### Requirements\n* Discord account and bot/app with OAuth2 app credentials for message read, react, and post permissions.\n* Google Sheets account for task data storage, with a spreadsheet structured as specified (Sheets: `Tasks`, `completed tasks`).\n* OpenAI API account with access to GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-5 mini models for AI task analysis and summarization.\n* Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n.\n* Properly set Discord server and channel IDs in the workflow.\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Try adding support for multiple Discord servers or channels to centralize tasks from different teams or projects.\n* Extend AI prompts to include deadlines parsing or automated reminders.\n* Customize the Google Sheets columns or the scoring logic to fit your unique productivity frameworks or KPIs.\n* Incorporate notifications via email or Slack based on task priority or completion.\n* Replace Google Sheets with other databases if scalable storage is required.\n* Adjust the energy level and impact criteria in AI prompts to match your personal productivity rhythms.\n\n### Sample inputs:\n- \"publish tasks tracker asap\"\n- \"Improve personal portfolio asap\"\n- \"Watch new movie - Jujutsu Kaisen\"\n\n### Sample output:\n🔥 **Today's Agenda**\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⚡ **Morning Deep Work Blocks** (High Energy Required)\nDo these during peak hours (6 AM to 2 PM or whenever you're sharpest)\n\n**1️⃣ Improve personal portfolio for job applications**\n💡 Why: Critical for landing &gt;
