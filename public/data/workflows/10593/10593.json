The system also performs credit risk assessment and alerts your AR team about overdue accounts with specific collection recommendations.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. **Configure webhook URL** in your accounting system (QuickBooks/Xero/etc.)\n2. **Add company branding** in \"Enrich with Company Data\" node\n3. **Connect HTML to PDF API** (get free API key at htmlcsstoimage.com)\n4. **Authenticate Google Drive** for statement archival\n5. **Connect Gmail** for customer delivery\n6. **Add Slack webhook URLs** in both notification nodes\n7. **Test with sample data** before connecting live system\n\n💡 **Required data:** customerName, customerEmail, accountNumber, statementPeriod (startDate/endDate), transactions array"
