  "description": "## Use case\nThis workflow snoozes any Todoist tasks, by moving them into a Snoozed todoist list and unsnoozes them 3 days before due date. Helps keep inbox clear only of tasks you need to worry about soon.\n![Screenshot 20240228 at 19.40.42.png](fileId:754)\n\n## How to setup\n1. Add your Todoist creds\n2. Create a Todoist project called `snoozed`\n3. Set the project ids in the relevant nodes\n4. Add due dates to your tasks in Inbox. Watch them disappear to `snoozed`. Set their date to tomorrow, watch it return to inbox.\n\n## How to adjust this template\nAdjust the timeline.. Maybe 3 days is too close for you. Works mostly for me :)",
