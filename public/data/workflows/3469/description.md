## Who is this for?  
This template is perfect for **Gumroad creators, solopreneurs, digital product sellers**, and **freelancers** who want to **track and thank customers automatically** — without spending time on manual work.

## What problem does this solve?  
Every sale is a moment to build trust. But manually checking your inbox for new orders, logging clients, and remembering to send a thank-you note? It’s time-consuming and inconsistent.

**This workflow handles it all:**  
From sale → to sheet → to ping → to personalized “thank you” — all fully automated.

---

## What this workflow does:  
✅ Triggers on each new sale on **Gumroad**  
📋 Extracts buyer details, amount paid, and product purchased  
📈 Logs the sale to a **Google Sheet** for tracking  
📲 Sends a **Telegram approval message** to notify you  
💌 (Optional) Sends a Gmail **thank-you email** to the buyer  
🔁 Keeps your workflow organized with color-coded notes and sample data

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions:

1. Create **Gumroad API** and connect the trigger node  
2. Authenticate with **Google Sheets** to store each client  
3. Connect your **Telegram bot** for real-time alerts  
4. (Optional) Setup **Gmail API** for sending thank-you emails  
5. Customize the email copy & sheet headers (e.g. % cut, timestamps)

## 🗒 Color-coded workflow notes:

To make customization smooth, the workflow includes a **color-coded sticky note system**:

🟩 **Green Notes** – Main building blocks (trigger, logging, ping, email)  
🟦 **Blue Notes** – Setup guidance and editable fields (e.g. your email or brand name)  
🟨 **Yellow Notes** – Optional upgrades (e.g. swap Gmail, use AI email generator, change to WhatsApp)

Each step has comments or hints to make your setup easy — whether you're new to n8n or a seasoned automator.
