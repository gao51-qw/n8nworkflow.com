## Description:
Automate your developer onboarding quality checks with this n8n workflow template.
 Whenever a new onboarding task is created in ClickUp, the workflow logs it to Google Sheets, evaluates its completeness using Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, and alerts your team in Slack if critical details are missing.
Perfect for engineering managers, DevOps leads, and HR tech teams who want to maintain consistent onboarding quality and ensure every developer gets the tools, credentials, and environment setup they need — without manual review.

## ✅ What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)

⚡ Step 1: Auto-Trigger on ClickUp Task Creation
 Listens for new task creation events (taskCreated) in your ClickUp workspace to initiate the audit automatically.

📊 Step 2: Log Task Details to Google Sheets
 Records essential task data — task name, assignee, and description — creating a central audit trail for all onboarding activities.

🧠 Step 3: AI Completeness Analysis (GPT-4o-mini)
Uses Azure OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to evaluate each onboarding task for completeness across key areas:
- Tooling requirements
- Credential setup
- Environment configuration
- Instruction clarity
