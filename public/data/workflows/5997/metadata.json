  "description": "# Malicious File Detection & Threat Summary Automation using Wazuh + VirusTotal + n8n\n\nThis workflow helps SOC teams automate the detection and reporting of potentially malicious files using **Wazuh alerts**, **VirusTotal hash validation**, and integrated **summary/report generation**. It's ideal for analysts who want instant context and communication for file-based threats — without writing a single line of code.\n\n---\n\n## What It Does\n\nWhen Wazuh detects a suspicious file:\n\n- **Ingests Wazuh Alert**  \n  A webhook node captures incoming alerts containing file hashes (SHA256/MD5).\n\n- **Parses IOCs**  \n  Extracts relevant indicators (file hash, filename, etc.).\n\n- **Validates with VirusTotal**  \n  Automatically checks the file hash reputation using VirusTotal's threat intelligence API.\n\n- **Generates Human-Readable Summary**  \n  Outputs a structured file report.\n\n- **Routes Alerts Based on Threat Level**  \n  - Sends a formatted email with the file summary using Gmail.  \n  - If the file is deemed malicious/suspicious:\n    - Creates a file-related incident ticket.  \n    - Sends an instant Slack alert to notify the team.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack Used\n\n- **Wazuh** – For endpoint alerting  \n- **VirusTotal API** – For real-time hash validation  \n- **n8n** – To orchestrate, parse, enrich, and communicate  \n- **Slack, Gmail, Incident Tool** – To notify and take action\n\n---\n\n## Ideal Use Case\n\nThis template is designed for security teams looking to automate **file threat triage**, **IOC validation**, and **alert-to-ticket escalation**, with zero human delay.\n\n---\n\n## Included Nodes\n\n- **Webhook** (Wazuh)\n- **Function** (IOC extraction and summary)\n- **HTTP Request** (VirusTotal)\n- **If / Switch** (threat level check)\n- **Gmail**, **Slack**, **Incident Creation**\n\n---\n\n## Tips\n\n- Make sure to add your **VirusTotal API key** in the HTTP node.  \n- Customize the **incident creation node** to fit your ticketing platform (Jira, ServiceNow, etc.).  \n- Add logic to enrich the file alert further using WHOIS or sandbox reports if needed.\n",
