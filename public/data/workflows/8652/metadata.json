  "description": "## Who’s it for\nTeams and project managers who want to turn meeting transcripts into actionable Trello tasks automatically, without worrying about duplicate cards.\n\n## What it does\nThis workflow receives a transcript file in `.txt` format and processes it with AI to extract clear, concise tasks. Each task includes a short title, a description, an assignee (if mentioned), and a deadline (if available).  \nThe workflow then checks Trello for duplicates across **all lists**, comparing both card titles (`name`) and descriptions (`desc`). If a matching card already exists, the workflow returns the existing Trello card ID. If not, it creates a new card in the predefined default list.  \nFinally, the workflow generates a **user-friendly summary**: how many tasks were found, how many already existed, how many new cards were created, and how many tasks had no assignee or deadline.\n\n## Requirements\n- A Trello account with API credentials configured in n8n (no hardcoded keys).\n- An OpenAI (or compatible) LLM account connected in n8n.\n\n## How to customize\n- Adjust similarity thresholds for title/description matching in the Trello Sub-Agent.\n- Modify the summary text to always return in your preferred language.\n- Extend the Trello card creation step with labels, members, or due dates.\n",
