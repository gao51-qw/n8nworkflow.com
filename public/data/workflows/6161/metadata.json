  "description": "## Who’s it for\nThis template is designed for bakeries, event planners, and e-commerce platforms that want to automatically generate **custom cake designs**. It’s also ideal for marketers or digital creators who need personalized celebratory visuals for social media or email campaigns.\n\n## How it works\nThis workflow converts simple user input (e.g., “Sarah’s Birthday”) into a creative cake design:\n1. **Webhook:** Captures user input from the Bolt frontend form.\n2. **OpenAI GPT:** Generates a detailed and creative cake design prompt.\n3. **Replicate Flux Schnell:** Produces a unique cake image using the AI-generated prompt.\n4. **HTTP Response:** Sends the final cake image back to the frontend.\n\n## How to set up\n1. Import this template into n8n.\n2. Add your **OpenAI API Key** under n8n **Credentials** for the OpenAI Chat Model node.\n3. Add your **Replicate API Token** as an **HTTP Header Auth credential** (do not hardcode it).\n4. Update the **Webhook node** URL in the Bolt frontend form to send a `POST` request to n8n.\n5. (Optional) Customize the OpenAI prompt in the Prompt Generator node to adjust cake style, colors, or decorations.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n account (cloud or self-hosted).\n- **OpenAI API Key** for prompt generation.\n- **Replicate API Token** for AI image generation.\n- A Bolt frontend or any form that can call the webhook endpoint.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- Replace \"cake\" with any product type (e.g., mugs, greeting cards, or T-shirts).\n- Add a database node (Google Sheets or Supabase) to log user requests and images.\n- Implement input moderation by adding an OpenAI moderation node before the prompt generation.\n![Screenshot 20250723 at 09.53.44.png](fileId:1833)  [Frontend](https://calm-cendol-1a3ff2.netlify.app)",
