  "description": "### Who is it for?\nAnyone who wants to automatically aggregate their invoices or receipts. Main beneficiaries: small business owners and freelancers.\n\n### How it works\n1.  Creates a folder in Google Drive for uploading invoices and receipts. Responds (Webhook response) with URL to the created folder.\n2.  Gets all emails with attachments from a Gmail mailbox.\n3. (Optional) Filters emails, e.g. exclude emails sent to specific address.\n4.  Filters only PDF attachments.\n5.  Classifies all PDF attachment contents with an AI model (is it a receipt or an invoice?).\n6.  Uploads receipts and invoices to the created Google Drive folder and optionally sends an email with the attachments to, e.g., your accountant.\n\n### Pre-conditions/Requirements\n-   Gmail and Google Drive accounts\n-   A Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 Client ID or a service account with Google Drive and Gmail APIs enabled\n-   OpenAI API account and API key\n\n### Set up steps\n1.  Provide credentials for the nodes: Gmail, Google Drive, OpenAI.\n2.  Configure parameters in the \"Configure\" node. Most importantly:\n    -   \"**sendInvoicesTo**\" for the email address where invoices/receipts should be sent.\n3.  It uses a Webhook node trigger. It expects a body with a schema such as:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"getInvoicesAndReceiptsFromEmails\",\n  \"description\": \"Finds and uploads to Google Drive all receipts and invoices from emails within a specified date range.\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"startDate\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"date-time\",\n        \"description\": \"The start date of the range to search for emails. Must be in ISO 8601 format.\"\n      },\n      \"endDate\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"date-time\",\n        \"description\": \"The end date of the range to search for emails. Must be in ISO 8601 format.\"\n      },\n      \"sendEmail\": {\n        \"type\": \"boolean\",\n        \"description\": \"Indicates whether to send an email with all receipts and invoices after processing. Must be true or false.\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n      \"startDate\",\n      \"endDate\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\nExample body:\n```json\n{\n  \"startDate\": \"2025-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"endDate\": \"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"sendEmail\": true\n}\n```\n### How to use with AI chat\n\nYou can trigger the workflow with an AI chat that supports tool use, such as [BrowseWiz](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/browsewiz-ai-assistant-ai/ioohfnlbpolaalcbppaggpgcgpldohfg).
