Whether you're a solo founder, indie hacker, or community builder, this setup will allow you to collect subscribers, send them curated job updates, and manage unsubscriptions — all with full control and zero reliance on third-party newsletter tools.\n\n## 🚀 Goal of This Guide\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will have a fully working system that allows you to:\n- Collect user subscriptions from a modern frontend interface\n- Send welcome or rejection emails (using your own SMTP)\n- Automatically scrape jobs via an API and send them to subscribers weekly or daily\n- Manage unsubscriptions with confirmation and webhook logic\n- Customize and manage all this using n8n workflows with no-code/low-code skills\n\nThis system is perfect for niche job boards, community newsletters, or any project that needs automated content delivery to subscribers.\n\n## 🧱 Tools You'll Be Using\n\n- **n8n** – for automation workflows and acting as your backend\n- **Bolt.new** – to build your newsletter landing page and subscription interface\n- **Google Sheets** – to act as your lightweight subscriber/job database\n- **RapidAPI** – to pull job listings from the Jobs Search API\n- **Custom SMTP Email (Optional)** – to send branded emails using your own domain\n\n## 📄 Step 1: Set Up Your Google Sheets Database\n\nMake a copy of this Google Sheets template that will serve as your database:\n\n🔗 **Click here to copy the Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vxYkjfwIrnNHN6PIdAOa_HZdTvMXI0lm_Jecac4YO0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)**\n\nThis includes:\n- A Subscribers sheet to store new signups\n- An Unsubscribers sheet to prevent duplicates\n- A Jobs sheet to store scraped job listings\n\n## ⚙ Step 2: Get Your API Key for Jobs Scraping\n\nWe use this API from RapidAPI to pull job listings programmatically:\n\n🔗 **[Jobs Search API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/rphrp1985/api/jobs-search-api/playground/apiendpoint_a166931a-12c8-4513-bcd3-f4c0f3f34a5b)**\n\n1.
