  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## 🚀 Overview  \nThis workflow enables a powerful AI-driven virtual assistant that dynamically responds to website queries using **webhook input**, **Pinecone vector search**, and **OpenAI agents** — all smartly routed based on the source website.\n\n## 🔧 How It Works  \n\n1. **Webhook Trigger**  \n   The workflow starts with a `Webhook` node that receives query parameters:\n   - `query`: The user's question  \n   - `userId`: Unique user identifier  \n   - `site`: Website identifier (e.g., test_site)  \n   - `page`: Page identifier (e.g., homepage, pricing)  \n\n2. **Smart Routing**  \n   A `Switch` node directs the request to the correct AI agent based on the `site` value. Each AI agent uses:\n   - OpenAI GPT-4/3.5 model  \n   - Pinecone vector store for context-aware answers  \n   - SQL-based memory for consistent multi-turn conversation  \n\n3. **Contextual AI Agent**  \n   Each agent is customized per website using:\n   - Site-specific Pinecone namespaces  \n   - Predefined system prompts to stay in scope  \n   - Webhook context including `page`, `site`, and `userId`  \n\n4. **Final Response**  \n   The response is sent back to the originating website using the `Respond to Webhook` node.\n\n## 🧠 Use Case  \nIdeal for multi-site platforms that want to serve **tailored AI chat experiences** per domain or page — whether it’s support, content discovery, or interactive agents.\n\n## ✅ Highlights  \n- 🧠 Vector search using Pinecone for contextual responses  \n- 🔀 Website-aware logic with `Switch` node routing  \n- 🔐 No hardcoded API keys  \n- 🧩 Modular agents for scalable multi-site support  \n",
