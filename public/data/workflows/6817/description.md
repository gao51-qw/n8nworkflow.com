This workflow is designed for teams or freelancers who want to auto-generate and send contracts based on information gathered from a Typeform (e.g., client name, project scope, deadlines). Perfect for HR onboarding, client agreements, or legal operations.

## Prerequisites
- To use this workflow, you’ll need:
- A Typeform account and a published form
- Access to Google Docs (or use a local document template)
- Gmail or SMTP email integration in n8n
- n8n Desktop or a hosted n8n instance

## How It Works
- **Trigger:** Listens for new Typeform submissions.
- **Extract Data:** Parses the answers from the form.
- **Generate Contract:** Fills a contract template using form inputs.
- **Create PDF:** Exports the filled contract as a PDF.
- **Send Email:** Sends the PDF to the client’s email address provided in the form.

## Nodes Used
- **Typeform Trigger** – Triggers on form submission.
- **Set Node** – Maps form answers into variables.
- **Google Docs (or HTTP Request)** – Uses a template to generate the contract.
- **Google Drive / PDF Converter** – Converts to PDF (if needed).
- **Email (Gmail/SMTP)** – Sends the completed contract to the recipient.


## Tips
- Replace the Google Docs template ID with your own.
- Ensure the variable placeholders (like {{client_name}}) match your document.
- Use the Cron node instead of Typeform Trigger if you want to poll periodically.
