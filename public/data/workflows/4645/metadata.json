  "title": "Create AI-powered website chatbot with Langflow backend and custom branding",
  "description": "This workflow integrates a chatbot frontend with a backend powered by **Langflow**, a visual low-code AI development tool. The flow is triggered whenever a chat message is received via the n8n chatbot widget embedded on a website. It then sends the message to a Langflow flow for processing and returns the generated response to the user.\n\n![image](https://n3wstorage.b-cdn.net/test/langflow_flow.png)\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Chat Trigger**: The workflow starts with a webhook trigger (`When chat message received`) that listens for incoming chat messages from the n8n Chat interface.  \n2. **Langflow Integration**: The chat input is sent to a Langflow instance via an HTTP request (`Langflow` node). The request includes the user's message and expects a response from the Langflow flow.  \n3. **Response Processing**: The output from Langflow is extracted and formatted using the `Edit Fields` node, ensuring the chatbot displays the response correctly.  \n4. **Customization**: Sticky notes provide instructions for embedding the n8n Chat widget on a website and customizing its appearance, including welcome messages, language settings, and branding.  \n\n--- \n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Configure Langflow Connection**:  \n   - Replace `LANGFLOW_URL` and `FLOW_ID` in the HTTP request node with your Langflow instance details.  \n   - Ensure the API headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`) and authentication (if required) are correctly set.  \n\n2. **Deploy n8n Chat**:  \n   - Add the provided CDN script to your website, replacing `YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL generated by the `When chat message received` node.  \n   - Customize the chatbot’s UI (e.g., title, placeholder text, initial messages) using the JavaScript snippet in the sticky notes.  \n\n3. **Activate Workflow**:  \n   - Toggle the workflow to \"Active\" in n8n.  \n   - Test the chatbot by sending a message and verifying the Langflow response is processed and displayed correctly.  \n\n---\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n✅ **Seamless Langflow Integration**\nIt allows n8n to communicate directly with a Langflow flow via API, enabling AI responses using custom-designed Langflow logic.\n\n✅ **No-Code Chatbot Deployment**\nWith just a script snippet, the chatbot widget can be embedded into any website. Minimal coding is required to launch a fully functioning AI chatbot.\n\n✅ **Customizable UI/UX**\nThe included embed code offers full control over the chatbot's appearance, language, welcome message, input placeholder, and branding—ideal for white-label or customer-facing deployments.\n\n✅ **Modular and Extensible**\nBecause it's built in n8n, this chatbot can be easily extended with other services like CRMs, email alerts, or databases, without leaving the platform.\n\n✅ **Real-Time AI Interactions**\nThanks to Langflow's API and chat response support, users get immediate and dynamic AI-driven replies.\n\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
