# Create AI-powered website chatbot with Langflow backend and custom branding

> This workflow integrates a chatbot frontend with a backend powered by **Langflow**, a visual low-code AI development tool. The flow is triggered whenever a chat message is received via the n8n chatbot widget embedded on a website. It then sends the message to a Langflow flow for processing and returns the generated response to the user.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Chat Trigger**: The workflow starts with a webhook trigger (`When chat message received`) that listens for incoming chat messages from the n8n Chat interface.  
2. **Langflow Integration**: The chat input is sent to a Langflow instance via an HTTP request (`Langflow` node). The request includes the user's message and expects a response from the Langflow flow.  
3. **Response Processing**: The output from Langflow is extracted and formatted using the `Edit Fields` node, ensuring the chatbot displays the response correctly.  
4. **Customization**: Sticky notes provide instructions for embedding the n8n Chat widget on a website and customizing its appearance, including welcome messages, language settings, and branding.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Configure Langflow Connection**:  
   - Replace `LANGFLOW_URL` and `FLOW_ID` in the HTTP request node with your Langflow instance details.  
   - Ensure the API headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`) and authentication (if required) are correctly set.  

2. **Deploy n8n Chat**:  
   - Add the provided CDN script to your website, replacing `YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL generated by the `When chat message received` node.  
   - Customize the chatbot’s UI (e.g., title, placeholder text, initial messages) using the JavaScript snippet in the sticky notes.  

3. **Activate Workflow**:  
   - Toggle the workflow to "Active" in n8n.  
   - Test the chatbot by sending a message and verifying the Langflow response is processed and displayed correctly.

### **Advantages**

✅ **Seamless Langflow Integration**
It allows n8n to communicate directly with a Langflow flow via API, enabling AI responses using custom-designed Langflow logic.

✅ **No-Code Chatbot Deployment**
With just a script snippet, the chatbot widget can be embedded into any website. Minimal coding is required to launch a fully functioning AI chatbot.

✅ **Customizable UI/UX**
The included embed code offers full control over the chatbot's appearance, language, welcome message, input placeholder, and branding—ideal for white-label or customer-facing deployments.

✅ **Modular and Extensible**
Because it's built in n8n, this chatbot can be easily extended with other services like CRMs, email alerts, or databases, without leaving the platform.

✅ **Real-Time AI Interactions**
Thanks to Langflow's API and chat response support, users get immediate and dynamic AI-driven replies.
