  "description": "# Why?\n\nHave you ever updated your n8n instance, or moved from one instance to the other and lost all your workflows? I suggest NOT DOING THAT! Especially if you have very complex workflows that would take days to recreate.\n\nMake sure you have a backup process in place!\n\n# How it works\n\n1. Get all workflows from an n8n instance using your n8n API\n2. Formats the workflows cleanly\n3. Creates a backup package\n4. Checks if target GitHub repository exists, if not creates it\n5. Uploads a manifest\n6. Uploads a readme\n7. Uploads your workflows as separate JSON files\n8. Sends a summary to your choice (Telegram or GMAIL)\n\n# What it does\n- Backs up all your workflows\n- Splits them out into separate JSON files for each workflow\n- Sends a notification\n\n# What it doesn't do\n\n- Does not back up credentials (not smart for security reasons)\n- Does not delete old backups\n\n# Requirements\n- n8n\n- n8n API setup with credentials stored in instance you are running this from\n- GitHub user & API (with repository rights) setup (API key in Github, Credentials in n8n)\n# Future Updates\n\nIf I get requests for these features I would build them:\n\n- Rolling backups (delete further back than 3 days)\n- Logic to skip the backup if nothing changed",
