## How it works
- Use Telegram to send in new phrases (`flashcard front`)
- You can also manually input phrase in the workflow itself
- ChatGPT generates provided phrase description (in English but you can change it) including multiple meanings & generates  examples of using the phrase in a sample sentence (`flashcard back`)

## Steps to setup
- Provide your Telegram bot API key (optional)
- Provide your OpenAI key
- Provide Google Sheets credentials

## How to import flashcards from Google Sheets into Anki
- Use Google Sheets to Anki add-on: [1871608121](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1871608121)

Enjoy
