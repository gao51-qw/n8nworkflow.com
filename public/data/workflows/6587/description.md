### **How It Works**  
1. **Trigger**:  
   - The workflow starts with a **Gmail Trigger** node that monitors incoming emails with the subject "Your meeting recap". It checks for new emails every hour.  
   - Alternatively, it can be manually triggered using the **"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’"** node for testing.  
   -  Alternatively, via **Webhook**.  

2. **Email Processing**:  
   - The **"Get a message"** node fetches the full email content.  
   - The **"Set Meeting link"** node extracts the meeting link from the email.  
   - The **"Information Extractor"** (powered by OpenAI) processes the email text to identify the meeting URL.  

3. **Transcript Retrieval**:  
   - A **Code node** parses the meeting ID from the URL.  
   - The **"Get a transcript"** node (Fireflies.ai integration) fetches the full meeting transcript using the extracted meeting ID.  

4. **Transcript Processing**:  
   - The **"Set sentences"** and **"Set summary"** nodes extract structured data (sentences, short summary, overview) from the transcript.  
   - The **"Full transcript"** node combines all transcript segments into a readable format.  

5. **AI Summarization & Email Generation**:  
   - **Google Gemini models** analyze and summarize the transcript in Italian (**"Expert Meeting transcripts"**) and generate a client-friendly recap (**"Meeting summary expert"**).  
   - The **"Email writer"** node combines summaries into a cohesive email draft.  
   - The **Markdown to HTML** nodes format the content for email readability.  

6. **Output**:  
   - A **"Draft email to client"** node prepares the final recap.  
   - Two Gmail nodes (**"Send Full meeting summary"** and **"Send a message1"**) dispatch the summaries to the specified recipient.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Configure Credentials**:  
   - Ensure the following credentials are set up in n8n:  
     - **Fireflies.ai API** (for transcript retrieval).  
     - **Gmail OAuth2** (for email triggering/sending).  
     - **OpenAI API** (for initial text extraction).  
     - **Google Gemini (PaLM)** (for summarization).  

2. **Adjust Nodes**:  
   - Update the **"Gmail Trigger"** node with the correct email filter (`subject:Your meeting recap`).  
   - Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` in the **Gmail Send nodes** with the recipient’s address.  
   - Verify the **Code nodes** (e.g., meeting ID extraction) match your URL structure.  

3. **Deploy**:  
   - Activate the workflow.  
   - Test using the **Manual Trigger** or wait for the Gmail trigger to execute automatically.  

4. **Optional Customization**:  
   - Modify the **Google Gemini prompts** for different summary styles.  
   - Adjust the **email templates** in the final Gmail nodes.
