## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Webhook**  
   Listens for incoming Wazuh alerts in real time.

2. **If Condition**  
   Filters based on severity (`1 low`, `2 medium`, etc.) or other logic you define.

3. **AI Investigation (LangChain + OpenAI)**  
   Summarizes full alert logs and context using custom prompts to generate:
   - Incident Overview  
   - Key Indicators  
   - Log Analysis  
   - Threat Classification  
   - Risk Assessment  
   - Security Recommendations

4. **Notification Delivery**  
   The report is parsed, cleaned, and sent to your SOC team in real-time, enabling rapid response — even during high-alert volumes.

5. **No-Op Path**  
   Efficiently discards irrelevant alerts without breaking the flow.

## 🧠 Why n8n + AI?

Traditional alert triage is **manual**, **slow**, and **error-prone** — leading to analyst burnout and missed critical threats.

This workflow shows how combining **workflow automation** with a **tailored AI model** enables your SOC to shift from **reactive** to **proactive**. Analysts can now:
- Focus on **critical investigations**
- Respond to alerts **faster**
- Eliminate **copy-paste fatigue**
- Get instant **contextual summaries**

&gt; ⚠️ **Note:** We learned that generic AI isn’t enough. Context-rich prompts and alignment with your actual SOC processes are key to meaningful, scalable automation.
