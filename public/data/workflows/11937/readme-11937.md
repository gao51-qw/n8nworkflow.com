# Automate company data enrichment with HubSpot, Sona, OpenAI & Google Sheets

> ## Automatically identify ICP matches by enriching basic company records with Sona Enrich data—combining web scraping, AI analysis, and the structured attributes that define your ideal customer.

Import company domains from a Google Sheet, automatically analyze their websites with AI, enrich them with firmographic data via Sona Enrich, and sync the results to HubSpot—so you can quickly discover and target your ideal customers.

## How it works

**Step 1: Data Input & Web Scraping**

- Reads company domains from your Google Sheet
- Scrapes each website's content via HTTP requests
- Extracts and cleans HTML content
- Removes navigation, footers, and noise

**Step 2: AI Analysis**

- Sends cleaned content to OpenAI Chat Model
- Extracts structured company intelligence (industry, positioning, features, personas)
- Captures and analyzes pricing, pros/cons, and value propositions
- Aggregates all AI results into standardized format
- Advanced users: You can modify the data that's generated and then add custom fields to HubSpot

**Step 3: HubSpot Preparation**

- Creates custom fields in HubSpot CRM
- Prepares AI-extracted data for import
- Splits aggregated data into individual company records
- Ready for batch processing

**Step 4: Enrich & Sync to HubSpot**

- Loops through each company one by one
- Enriches with the Sona API (firmographics, revenue, employees, funding, and more)
- Creates company record in HubSpot
- Formats and populates all custom fields
- Combines AI insights + Sona data in one complete profile

## What you'll get

- **Web-Scraped Intelligence**: Business descriptions, features, and positioning directly from their website

  1. Go to HubSpot **Settings** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Legacy Apps**

**Configuration steps:**

1. **Prepare your data**: Create a Google Sheet with a "Website Domain" column and add 2-3 test companies (e.g., example.com)
2. **Connect Google Sheets**: In the "Get row(s) in sheet" node, authenticate and select your spreadsheet and sheet name
3. **Configure web scraping**: Update the HTTP Request node with your preferred scraping method or data source URL
4. **Set up AI Agent**: Add your OpenAI API key and customize the extraction prompt to define which company fields you want (industry, personas, features, etc.)
5. **Create HubSpot custom fields**: Review the "Create Custom HubSpot Fields" node and adjust property names to match your CRM structure
