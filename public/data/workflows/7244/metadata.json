  "description": "This automated n8n workflow automates AWS S3 bucket and file operations (create, delete, upload, download, copy, list) by parsing simple email commands and sending back success or error confirmations.\n\n### Good to Know\n- The workflow processes email requests via a Start Workflow (GET Request) node.\n- Data extraction from emails identifies S3 operation commands.\n- Error handling is included for invalid or missing email data.\n- Responses are sent via email for each action performed.\n\n## How It Works\n- **Start Workflow (GET Request)** - Captures incoming email requests.\n- **Extract Data from Email** - Parses email content to extract S3 operation commands.\n- **Check Task Type** - Validates the type of task (e.g., create bucket, delete file).\n- **Create a Bucket** - Creates a new S3 bucket.\n- **Delete a Bucket** - Deletes an existing S3 bucket.\n- **Copy a File** - Copies a file within S3.\n- **Delete a File** - Deletes a file from S3.\n- **Download a File** - Downloads a file from S3.\n- **Upload a File** - Uploads a file to S3.\n- **Get Many Files** - Lists multiple files in a bucket.\n- **Check Success or Fail** - Determines the outcome of the operation.\n- **Send Success Email** - Sends a success confirmation email.\n- **Send Failed Email** - Sends a failure notification email.\n\n## How to Use\n- Import the workflow into n8n.\n- Configure the Start Workflow (GET Request) node to receive email commands.\n- Test the workflow with sample email commands (e.g., \"create bucket: my-bucket\", \"upload file: document.pdf\").\n- Monitor email responses and adjust command parsing if needed.\n\n## Example **Email for Testing**\n\n```\nList files from the bucket json-test in Mumbai region.\n```\n\n## Requirements\n- AWS S3 credentials configured in n8n.\n- Email service integration (e.g., SMTP settings).\n- n8n environment with workflow execution permissions.\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n- Adjust the Extract Data from Email node to support additional command formats.\n- Modify the Send Success Email or Send Failed Email nodes to customize messages.\n- Update the S3 nodes to include additional bucket or file attributes.\n",
