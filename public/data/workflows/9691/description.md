## **Try It Out!**

The **SOL/USDT Multi-Timeframe AI Market Analyzer and Trader with Telegram Approval** is your fully automated Solana trading assistant powered by **AI**, **AFK Crypto**, and **Telegram**.

It runs hourly by default, fetches real-time market data for the SOL/USDT pair, and uses AI-driven logic to determine optimal entry, exit, and risk management strategies. You receive a **Telegram approval message** that lets you confirm or reject the trade instantly. Once approved, the bot executes trades via your **AFK Crypto Wallet** and keeps monitoring for Take-Profit or Stop-Loss triggers — sending alerts directly to Telegram when they’re hit.

This system combines automation with manual oversight, giving you AI precision with human approval control.

### **How It Works**

1. **Hourly Trigger** – The workflow initiates every hour to analyze the current market status.
2. **Fetch SOL Market Data (Crypto Compare)** – Retrieves multiple timeframe data (1m, 5m, 1h) for trend, momentum, and volatility analysis.
3. **AI Market Analyzer** – Processes data through an AI agent to identify:

   * Market sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral)
   * Recommended position: LONG / SHORT / HOLD
   * Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels
   * Confidence rating and reasoning
4. **Balance Check (AFK Crypto)** – Verifies wallet balance via `/v1/wallets/balances?chain=solana` and calculates position size based on 1% risk.
5. **Telegram Approval Message** – Sends a Telegram message containing AI insights and trade details with “✅ Approve” or “❌ Decline” buttons.
6. **Trade Execution (AFK Trade API)** – If approved, executes trade instantly via `/v1/trade/swap` using your AFK Crypto wallet.
7. **Live Trade Monitoring** – Monitors SOL price in real-time. Once Take-Profit or Stop-Loss conditions are met:

   * The position auto-closes.
   * A Telegram notification is sent summarizing results and updated balance.

### **How to Use**

1. **Import the workflow** into your n8n workspace.

   * **Crypto Compare API Key** – For fetching market data.
3. **Edit “Fetch SOL Market Data” Node:**
   Update the endpoint if you want different timeframes or markets.
4. **Set the schedule:**
   Default trigger = every hour (modifiable in the “Every Hour” node).
5. **Deploy and activate.**
   The bot will send you hourly market analyses via Telegram — allowing you to approve or skip each suggested trade.
