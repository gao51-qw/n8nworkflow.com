Simple workflow to get NASA APOD each day in your mail inbox, using the official RSS feed and a SMTP Node to use the server that you want (We recommend using GMAIL as it's free and simple to get an API Key).

You can change the RSS Feed to another one that you like and customize the HTML of the template as you want !
