Automated Email Verification & Digital Health Card Generator

### **Overview**
Transform your clinic's patient check-in process with this fully automated pre-registration system. When patients submit their appointment information through your website, this workflow instantly verifies their email, generates a professional digital health card with a scannable QR code, stores it securely in Google Drive, and sends personalized notifications to both the patient and your reception team—all in under 20 seconds.

### **What This Workflow Does**

This comprehensive automation handles the entire patient pre-check-in journey:

1. **Receives Patient Data** - Webhook captures form submissions from your website or app with patient details (name, email, phone, appointment date/time, symptoms, age, gender)

2. **Validates & Cleans Data** - Automatically validates required fields, cleans input data, and generates a unique patient ID with timestamp for tracking

3. **Verifies Email Address** - Uses VerifiEmail API to ensure email deliverability by checking RFC compliance, MX records, and filtering out disposable/spoof emails

4. **Generates QR Code** - Creates a unique verification URL and scannable QR code for instant patient identification at reception

5. **Builds Professional Health Card** - Generates a beautiful, responsive HTML health card featuring:
   - Patient information grid (name, ID, email, phone, age/gender, appointment)
   - Chief complaints/symptoms section
   - Embedded QR code for quick check-in
   - Important appointment instructions
   - Modern gradient design with mobile-responsive layout

6. **Converts to PNG Image** - Uses HTMLCSSToImg API to convert the HTML card into a high-quality PNG image (900x1200px)

7. **Stores in Google Drive** - Uploads the health card to an organized "Patients record" folder with patient ID-based naming for easy retrieval

8. **Emails Patient** - Sends a beautifully formatted email to the patient containing:
   - Their health card as a PNG attachment
   - Appointment details and confirmation
   - Google Drive link for backup access
   - Check-in instructions and preparation tips

9. **Notifies Reception Team** - Sends real-time Slack message to clinic reception with patient details, verification status, and Drive link

10. **Logs to Database** - Records complete patient information, timestamps, verification status, and file links in Google Sheets for tracking and analytics

11. **Returns Success Response** - Sends JSON response back to the website form with patient ID, confirmation, and Drive link
