When patients submit their appointment information through your website, this workflow instantly verifies their email, generates a professional digital health card with a scannable QR code, stores it securely in Google Drive, and sends personalized notifications to both the patient and your reception team—all in under 20 seconds.\n\n### **What This Workflow Does**\n\nThis comprehensive automation handles the entire patient pre-check-in journey:\n\n1. **Receives Patient Data** - Webhook captures form submissions from your website or app with patient details (name, email, phone, appointment date/time, symptoms, age, gender)\n\n2. **Validates & Cleans Data** - Automatically validates required fields, cleans input data, and generates a unique patient ID with timestamp for tracking\n\n3. **Verifies Email Address** -

Uploads the health card to an organized \"Patients record\" folder with patient ID-based naming for easy retrieval\n\n8. **Emails Patient** - Sends a beautifully formatted email to the patient containing:\n   - Their health card as a PNG attachment\n   - Appointment details and confirmation\n   - Google Drive link for backup access\n   - Check-in instructions and preparation tips\n\n9. **Notifies Reception Team** - Sends real-time Slack message to clinic reception with patient details, verification status, and Drive link\n\n10. **Logs to Database** - Records complete patient information, timestamps, verification status, and file links in Google Sheets for tracking and analytics\n\n11. **Returns Success Response** -
