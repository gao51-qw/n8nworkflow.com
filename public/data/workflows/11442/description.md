# LinkedIn Content Generation Workflow

## Summary
Automated workflow that transforms Notion content notes into publication-ready LinkedIn posts using Claude AI. Monitors Notion database and generates multiple variations based on structured outlines, so that the author can pick the one they like most.

## Use Cases
- Automate LinkedIn content creation from content planning database.
- Generate multiple post variations from a single outline.
- Maintain consistent voice and formatting across all posts.
- Scale content production while preserving quality.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger** - Monitors Notion "Content Plan" database hourly for updates. 
2. **Conditional Check** - Verifies "LinkedIn Post (Main)" tag and "Ready for Writing" status
3. **Main Post** - Claude generates single post from project name and notes
4. **Outline Analysis** - Parallel process creates 3 distinct post concepts with different angles
5. **Multi-Post Generation** - Each outline becomes a complete LinkedIn post
6. **Save to Notion** - All posts automatically saved to database

**AI Setup:**
