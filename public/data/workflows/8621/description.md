* * * * *

**Set up steps**
----------------

-   Trigger -- Add a Cron to run daily (pick your time and timezone).

-   Fetch -- Add one RSS Read node per source and connect all to a Merge (append).

-   De-duplicate (this run) -- Add Remove Duplicates and compare on a stable key (prefer the article URL).

-   Freshness -- Add an IF to pass only items published in the last 24 hours.

-   Limit -- Add Limit to cap the total items (e.g., 25).

-   Summarize -- Add OpenAI → Message a model to produce a JSON brief with subject + HTML body.

-   Email -- Add Gmail → Send to deliver the brief to your inbox.

**Tips & troubleshooting**
--------------------------

-   If everything gets discarded at de-dup while testing, switch to "within current input" or reset the node's stored values.

-   If no items pass the IF, widen the date window temporarily (some feeds publish late).

-   If the email arrives blank, ensure Gmail email type is set to HTML and the subject/body fields map to the model's output.
