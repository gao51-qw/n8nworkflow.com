  "description": "### Video Guide\n\n\nI prepared a detailed guide explaining how to build an AI-powered meeting assistant that provides real-time transcription and insights during virtual meetings.\n\n[![Test](https://res.cloudinary.com/de9jgixzm/image/upload/v1739773273/Youtube%20Thumbs/Realtim%20AI%20Agent.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaX6BMiTeo)\n\n[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtaX6BMiTeo)\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is ideal for business professionals, project managers, and team leaders who require effective transcription of meetings for improved documentation and note-taking. It's particularly beneficial for those who conduct frequent virtual meetings across various platforms like Zoom and Google Meet.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\nTranscribing meetings manually can be tedious and prone to error. This workflow automates the transcription process in real-time, ensuring that key discussions and decisions are accurately captured and easily accessible for later review, thus enhancing productivity and clarity in communications.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThe workflow employs an AI-powered assistant to join virtual meetings and capture discussions through real-time transcription. Key functionalities include:\n- Automatic joining of meetings on platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, and others with the ability to provide real-time transcription.\n- Integration with transcription APIs (e.g., AssemblyAI) to deliver seamless and accurate capture of dialogue.\n- Structuring and storing transcriptions efficiently in a database for easy retrieval and analysis.\n\n1. **Real-Time Transcription**: The assistant captures audio during meetings and transcribes it in real-time, allowing participants to focus on discussions.\n2. **Keyword Recognition**: Key phrases can trigger specific actions, such as noting important points or making prompts to the assistant.\n3. **Structured Data Management**: The assistant maintains a database of transcriptions linked to meeting details for organized storage and quick access later.\n\n### Setup\n\n#### Preparation\n\n1. **Create Recall.ai API key**\n2. **Setup Supabase account and table**\n```\ncreate table\n  public.data (\n    id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),\n    date_created timestamp with time zone not null default (now() at time zone 'utc'::text),\n    input jsonb null,\n    output jsonb null,\n    constraint data_pkey primary key (id),\n  ) tablespace pg_default;\n\n```\n3. **Create OpenAI API key**\n\n#### Development\n\n1. **Bot Creation**: \n   - Use a node to create the bot that will join meetings. Provide the meeting URL and set transcription options within the API request.\n\n2. **Authentication**: \n   - Configure authentication settings via a Bearer token for interacting with your transcription service.\n\n3. **Webhook Setup**: \n   - Create a webhook to receive real-time transcription updates, ensuring timely data capture during meetings.\n\n4. **Join Meeting**: \n   - Set the bot to join the specified meeting and actively listen to capture conversations.\n\n5. **Transcription Handling**: \n   - Combine transcription fragments into cohesive sentences and manage dialog arrays for coherence.\n\n6. **Trigger Actions on Keywords**: \n   - Set up keyword recognition that can initiate requests to the OpenAI API for additional interactions based on captured dialogue.\n\n7. **Output and Summary Generation**: \n   - Produce insights and summary notes from the transcriptions that can be stored back into the database for future reference.",
