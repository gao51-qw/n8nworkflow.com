### This n8n template demonstrates how to use the tool to crawl comments from a YouTube video and simply get all the results in a linked Google Sheet.

Use cases are many: Whether you're **a YouTube creator** trying to understand your audience, **a marketer** running sample analysis, **a data analyst** compiling engagement metrics, or part of **a growth team** tracking YouTube or social media campaign performance, this workflow helps you extract real, actionable insights from YouTube video comments at scale.

## How It Works
- The workflow starts when you manually click **Test Workflow** or **Execute Workflow** in N8N.
- It reads the list of YouTube video URLs from the **Video URLs** tab in the connected **YouTube – Get Video Comments** Google Sheet. Only the URLs marked with the **Ready** status will be processed.
- The tool loops through each video and sends an HTTP request to the YouTube API to fetch comment data.
- Then, it checks whether the request is successful before continuing.
- If comments are found, they are split and processed.
- Each comment is then inserted in the **Results** tab of the connected **YouTube – Get Video Comments** Google Sheet.
- Once a URL has been finished, its status in the **Video URLs** tab of the **YouTube – Get Video Comments** Google Sheet is updated to **Finished**.

## How To Use
- Download the workflow package. 
- Import the workflow package into your N8N interface.
- Duplicate the [**"YouTube - Get Video Comments"** Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5yEhjBWu3fnwgHGLsPLD9_tWRqUnxu4p0DEvUTae1Y/edit?gid=426418282#gid=426418282) into your Google Sheets account.
- Set up **Google Cloud Console** credentials in the following nodes in N8N, ensuring enabled access and suitable rights to Google Sheets and YouTube services:
    + For Google Sheets access, ensure each node is properly connected to the correct tab in your connected Google Sheet template: 
         Node **Google Sheets - Get Video URLs** → connected to the **Video URLs** tab; 
         Node **Google Sheets - Insert/Update Comment** → connected to the **Results** tab; 
         Node **Google Sheets - Update Status** connected to the **Video URLs** tab.
    + For YouTube access: Set up a GET method in Node **HTTP Request - Get Comments**.
- Open the template in your Google Sheets account. In the tab **Video URLs**, fill in the video URLs you want to crawl in **Column B** and update the status for each row in **Column A** to **Ready**.
- Return to the N8N interface and click **Execute Workflow**.
- Check the results in the **Results** tab of the template - the collected comments will appear there.

## Requirements
- Basic setup in Google Cloud Console (OAuth or API Key method enabled) with enabled access to YouTube and Google Sheets.

## How To Customize
- By default, the workflow is manually triggered in N8N. However, you can automate the process by adding a Google Sheets trigger that monitors new entries in your connected **YouTube – Get Video Comments** template and starts the workflow automatically.
