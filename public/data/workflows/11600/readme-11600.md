# Automate lead meeting scheduling with Zoho CRM, Google Calendar & Gemini AI

> # Zoho CRM - Smart Meeting Scheduler

This workflow automatically schedules meetings for new Zoho CRM leads by detecting their timezone, checking the sales rep’s Google Calendar, generating conflict-free time slots, creating a Zoom meeting and sending a personalized AI-generated email to the lead. If no slots are available, it sends a fallback message to the lead without updating Zoho CRM. When a meeting is created, all details are logged inside Zoho CRM for visibility.


### ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps (Fast Start Guide)

- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
- Configure Zoho CRM, Google Calendar, Gmail, Zoom OAuth and Gemini AI credentials.
- Update meeting duration, working hours, buffer time and search window.
- Set email recipient to the lead’s email instead of test/static values.
- Add the webhook URL to Zoho CRM → Automation → Webhooks.
- Test with a new lead and activate the workflow.


## 📘 What It Does
This workflow automates scheduling for new Zoho CRM leads. As soon as a lead is created, it retrieves full lead and owner details, detects the lead’s timezone and checks the assigned sales rep’s upcoming Google Calendar events. This helps identify when the rep is available.

Using your settings—working hours, meeting duration, buffer before/after and days to evaluate—the system generates valid meeting time slots with no conflicts. If suitable slots exist, it authenticates with Zoom and creates a meeting for the earliest option, then generates a polished HTML invitation using Gemini AI and emails it to the lead. This ensures a fast, smart and personalized lead engagement process.

If no slots exist, the workflow sends a fallback email informing the lead that no availability is open in the next few days. In this branch, Zoho CRM is not updated, because no meeting was scheduled.


## 🎯 Who’s It For

This workflow is perfect for:

- Sales teams managing high inbound volume  
- CRM managers automating lead qualification & engagement  
- SaaS companies scheduling demos automatically  
- Agencies booking consultation calls  
- Any team struggling with timezone-based scheduling manually
