### Benefits
* **Zero API Costs** - Operates entirely through free Google Maps scraping without expensive third-party services
* **Unlimited Lead Generation** - Extract emails from thousands of Google Maps listings across any industry
* **Geographic Targeting** - Search by specific cities, regions, or business types for precise lead targeting
* **Built-in Data Cleaning** - Automatic duplicate removal, filtering, and data validation
* **Scalable Processing** - Handle hundreds of businesses per search with intelligent rate limiting

### How It Works

1.  **Lead Ingestion**: I have given a free browser extension to scrape leads from **Google Maps** and import them directly into a **Google Sheet**.
	1. Business Name
	2. Business Phone Number
	3. Business Emails (From Step 3)
	3. Rating
	4. Reviews Count
	5. Industry
	6. Address
	7. Website
	8. Google Map Link
2.  **Website Crawling**: The n8n workflow reads the leads from your sheet and automatically crawls each website to find all internal pages.
3.  **Email Extraction**: For each page, the workflow intelligently scrapes for email addresses, filtering out image files and other non-relevant data.
4.  **Enrich and Update**:
    * If an email is found, the workflow updates the corresponding row in your Google Sheet with the new email address.
    * If no email is found after crawling the main page and all sub-pages, it marks the lead as "Not Found" so you can easily track your progress.

* **n8n**: A self-hosted or cloud instance of n8n.

2.  **Configure the workflow**: Import this n8n workflow JSON into your n8n instance and connect your **Google Sheets** credentials.
