## How it works

This workflow creates an MCP server that allows coding agents
(e.g. Claude, ChatGPT with MCP support, Clawed Code) to interact
with **Google Docs** programmatically.

Many agents today can find files in Google Drive, but cannot
open, edit, or format documents. This workflow fills that gap.

### What users can do

* Search for files in Google Drive
* Create new Google Docs
* Get document content
* Update docs with:
  * Find & Replace
  * Insert text
  * Add page breaks
  * Bullet and numbered lists
  * Checkbox lists
  * Insert tables

### Why it’s useful

This expands agent capabilities from *read-only* to full *read/write
and content manipulation* within Google Docs, enabling workflows
such as auto-writing reports, generating checklists, cleaning content,
and formatting structured output via AI.
