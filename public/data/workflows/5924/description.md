## AI Research Assistant via Telegram (GPT-4o mini + DeepSeek R1 + SerpAPI)



## 👥 Who’s it for

This workflow is perfect for anyone who wants to receive AI-powered research summaries directly on Telegram. Ideal for people asking frequent product, tech, or decision-making questions and want up-to-date answers sourced from the web.

## 🤖 What it does

Users send a question via Telegram. An AI agent (DeepSeek R1) reformulates and understands the intent, while a second agent (GPT-4o mini) performs live research using SerpAPI. The most relevant answers, including links and images, are delivered back via Telegram.

 
## ⚙️ How it works

🧠 DeepSeek R1 Agent – Understands, clarifies, or reformulates the user query.
