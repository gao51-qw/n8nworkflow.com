## Automated Support Prioritization and AI Task Creation

This n8n workflow instantly captures support issues submitted via **Jotform** and efficiently **routes** them to the appropriate team and logging system based on the **severity level** defined by the customer. It then uses an **AI Agent (Google Gemini)** to transform the raw customer data into a clear, concise, and actionable task for the development team.

### Workflow Overview

1.  **Ingestion & Logging:** A new support ticket is received via **Jotform** and immediately logged into a **Google Sheet** as a central record.
2.  **Priority Assessment & Routing:** An **If** node checks the reported issue **Severity**.
    * **High/Medium Severity:** The ticket details are instantly sent to a dedicated **Slack** channel for immediate team attention.
    * **Low Severity:** The ticket details are sent via **Gmail** (acting as an internal email notification) to a support inbox, allowing for less immediate handling.
3.  **AI Processing:** An **AI Agent** summarizes the raw feedback into a clear, professional task description.
4.  **Task Creation:** The AI-generated task is automatically created in **ClickUp** for the development team to manage.
