This workflow allows users to generate beautifully stylized 3D-rendered food emoji icons based on a simple text prompt. It combines user input, structured visual design generation, and image rendering using OpenAI’s GPT models.

## ✨ What It Does
1. Collects user input via a form: e.g. "green apple"
2. Generates a structured JSON specification describing the emoji’s form, lighting, texture, and color scheme
3. Uses AI to render an image based on that spec—styled like a high-quality emoji icon with a transparent background

## 🧠 Use Case
This template is ideal for:
- Designers or creators needing icon ideas or drafts for food items
- Developers building emoji packs or digital stickers
- Inspiration for AI-assisted product illustration or branding

## 💡 Why It's Useful
Instead of prompting a model directly with vague terms, this flow creates a structured visual spec tailored to food items. The final emoji-style icon is polished, modern, and downloadable.

## ✅ Requirements
To get started with this workflow, follow these steps:
1. **🔑 Configure Credentials**: Set up your API credentials for OpenAI and Google Drive
2. **💳 Add OpoenAI Credit**: Make sure to add credit to your OpenAI account, verify your organization (required for generating images)
3. **📊 Connect Google Drive**: Authenticate your Google Drive account
4. **⚙️ (Optional) Customize Prompts**: Adjust the prompts within the workflow to better suit your specific needs

**Note: Each image generation will cost you about $0.17**
