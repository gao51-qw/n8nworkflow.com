  "description": "![Screenshot 20250712 at 5.52.43 PM.png](fileId:1745)\n\nThis workflow allows users to generate beautifully stylized 3D-rendered food emoji icons based on a simple text prompt. It combines user input, structured visual design generation, and image rendering using OpenAI’s GPT models.\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n1. Collects user input via a form: e.g. \"green apple\"\n2. Generates a structured JSON specification describing the emoji’s form, lighting, texture, and color scheme\n3. Uses AI to render an image based on that spec—styled like a high-quality emoji icon with a transparent background\n\n## 🧠 Use Case\nThis template is ideal for:\n- Designers or creators needing icon ideas or drafts for food items\n- Developers building emoji packs or digital stickers\n- Inspiration for AI-assisted product illustration or branding\n\n## 💡 Why It's Useful\nInstead of prompting a model directly with vague terms, this flow creates a structured visual spec tailored to food items. The final emoji-style icon is polished, modern, and downloadable.\n\n## ✅ Requirements\nTo get started with this workflow, follow these steps:\n1. **🔑 Configure Credentials**: Set up your API credentials for OpenAI and Google Drive\n2. **💳 Add OpoenAI Credit**: Make sure to add credit to your OpenAI account, verify your organization (required for generating images)\n3. **📊 Connect Google Drive**: Authenticate your Google Drive account\n4. **⚙️ (Optional) Customize Prompts**: Adjust the prompts within the workflow to better suit your specific needs\n\n**Note: Each image generation will cost you about $0.17**\n\n",
