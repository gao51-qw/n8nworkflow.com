  "description": "WhatsApp AI Assistant for Clinic Appointment Booking\nAutomate your entire appointment lifecycle with an intelligent AI assistant that lives on WhatsApp. This workflow empowers any clinic or independent practitioner to manage bookings, take payments, and send reminders without manual intervention, using Google Sheets as a simple database.\n\nThis template handles everything from the initial booking conversation to sending the final reminder, allowing you to focus on your patients, not your schedule.\n\n## Features\n🤖 Conversational AI Booking: A Google Gemini-powered agent guides patients through booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments in a natural, friendly chat.\n\n🗓️ Smart Scheduling: The AI checks for available slots based on your working hours and existing appointments in Google Sheets, preventing double-bookings.\n\n🔔 Automated Reminders: A daily trigger automatically sends WhatsApp reminders to patients for their appointments on that day, reducing no-shows.\n\n💳 Seamless Payments: Integrated with Stripe to handle online payments. The workflow sends a confirmation message upon successful payment.\n\n📊 Centralized Management: Uses a single Google Sheet with separate tabs for Patients, Appointments, and Configuration, making it easy to view and manage all your data.\n\n🔄 Easy Rescheduling & Cancellations: Patients can manage their own bookings through the WhatsApp chat, and all changes are instantly reflected in your Google Sheet.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you begin, you will need the following accounts and credentials:\n\nn8n Account: A running n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).\n\nWhatsApp Business Account: Access to the WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nGoogle Account: For using Google Sheets and the Google Gemini (AI) API.\n\nStripe Account: To process online payments.\n\nn8n Credentials: You must configure credentials in your n8n instance for:\n\nWhatsApp Cloud API\n\nGoogle Sheets (OAuth2)\n\nGoogle Gemini API\n\nStripe\n\n## Setup Instructions\nFollow these steps carefully to get your automated assistant up and running.\n\nStep 1: Set Up Your Google Sheet\nThis workflow relies on a specific Google Sheet structure.\n\nCreate a new Google Sheet.\n\nRename the sheet to something memorable, like \"Clinic Appointments\".\n\nCreate three tabs at the bottom with the exact names: Patients, Appointments, and Config.\n\nSet up the columns for each tab as follows (the header names must be an exact match):\n\nPatients tab:\npatient_id, whatsapp_number, name, age, gender\n\nAppointments tab:\nappointment_id, patient_id, whatsapp_number, date, time, payment_method, payment_status, status, stripe_payment_intent\n\nConfig tab:\nkey, value\n(Add a row with working_hours as the key and a value like 10:00-18:00)\n\nStep 2: Configure the Workflow Nodes\nNow, you'll link the workflow to your accounts and your new Google Sheet.\n\nUpdate All Google Sheets Nodes: Go through every Google Sheets node in the workflow (e.g., \"Get Appointment sheet\", \"Add Patient\", \"Google Sheets Trigger\") and do the following:\n\nSelect your Google Sheets credential from the dropdown.\n\nIn the Document ID field, paste the ID of your Google Sheet.\n\nSelect the correct sheet (Appointments, Patients, etc.) from the Sheet Name dropdown.\n\nUpdate All WhatsApp Nodes: Go through every WhatsApp node (e.g., \"Send message\", \"WhatsApp Trigger\", \"Send Payment Confirmation\"):\n\nSelect your WhatsApp credential.\n\nEnter your Phone Number ID from your Meta for Developers account.\n\nUpdate AI & Stripe Nodes:\n\nIn the Google Gemini Chat Model nodes, select your Google Gemini credential.\n\nIn the Stripe Trigger node, select your Stripe credential.\n\nStep 3: Activate the Workflow\nClick Save to apply your changes.\n\nClick the Activate toggle in the top-right corner to turn the workflow on.\n\nYour AI appointment assistant is now live! Send a message to your WhatsApp number to begin testing.\n\n## Customization\nChange Reminder Time: To change the daily reminder time, open the Schedule Trigger node and adjust the hour from the default of 8 AM.\n\nEdit AI Personality: To modify how the AI communicates, edit the system message in the AI Agent node (the one connected to the WhatsApp Trigger). You can change its tone, instructions, or language.",
