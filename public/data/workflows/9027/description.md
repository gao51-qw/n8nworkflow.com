## How It Works

### Phase 1: Message Reception & Classification
The system begins with a WhatsApp webhook trigger that captures all incoming messages in real-time. An intelligent switch node immediately analyzes each message to determine its content type - whether it's a text message, voice note, or image with optional caption. This classification is crucial as each media type requires different processing approaches to extract meaningful information.

### Phase 2: Advanced Media Processing
For voice messages, the system retrieves the audio file URL, downloads the content using authenticated requests, and processes it through OpenAI's Whisper transcription service to convert speech to text. Image messages follow a similar pattern - the system downloads the image and uses GPT-4 Vision to analyze and describe the visual content in detail. Text messages are processed directly, while all media types are ultimately converted to standardized text format for consistent AI processing.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Response Generation
The processed content is fed into a sophisticated AI agent powered by Claude Sonnet 4 via OpenRouter. This agent operates with a comprehensive system prompt that defines its role as a professional customer support representative with specific instructions for tone, language handling, and response protocols. The agent has access to a Google Docs tool that allows it to retrieve real-time information from your company's knowledge base.

### Phase 4: Contextual Memory Management
A memory buffer system maintains conversation history for each unique phone number, allowing for natural, flowing conversations where the AI remembers previous interactions and can reference earlier parts of the conversation. This creates a more human-like experience and reduces customer frustration from having to repeat information.

### Phase 5: Response Delivery
Generated responses are automatically sent back to the customer's WhatsApp number using the WhatsApp Business API, completing the conversation loop. The system maintains proper formatting and ensures message delivery confirmation.
