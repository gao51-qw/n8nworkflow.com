## Automated B2B Lead Generation: Google Places, Scrape.do & AI Enrichment


 This workflow is a powerful, fully automated B2B lead generation engine. It starts by finding businesses on Google Maps based on your criteria (*e.g., "dentists" in "Istanbul"*), assigns a quality score to each, and then uses **[Scrape.do](https://scrape.do?fpr=99aed)** to reliably access their websites. Finally, it leverages an AI agent to extract valuable contact information like emails and social media profiles. The final, enriched data is then neatly organized and saved directly into a Google Sheet.

This template is built for reliability, using **[Scrape.do](https://scrape.do?fpr=99aed)** to handle the complexities of web scraping, ensuring you can consistently gather data without getting blocked.

### 🚀 What does this workflow do?

*   Automatically finds businesses using the **Google Places API** based on a category and location you define.
*   Calculates a `leadScore` for each business based on its rating, website presence, and operational status to **prioritize high-quality leads**.
*   **Filters out low-quality leads** to ensure you only focus on the most promising prospects.
*   Reliably scrapes the website of each high-quality lead using **[Scrape.do](https://scrape.do?fpr=99aed)** to bypass common blocking issues and retrieve the raw HTML.
*   Uses an **AI Agent (OpenAI)** to intelligently parse the website's HTML and extract hard-to-find contact details (emails, social media links, phone numbers).
*   **Saves all enriched lead data** to a Google Sheet, creating a clean, actionable list for your sales or marketing team.
*   **Runs on a schedule**, continuously finding new leads without any manual effort.

### 🎯 Who is this for?

*   **Sales & Business Development Teams:** Automate prospecting and build targeted lead lists.
*   **Marketing Agencies:** Generate leads for clients in specific industries and locations.

*   **Reliable Website Access:** Leverages **[Scrape.do](https://scrape.do?fpr=99aed)** to handle proxies and prevent IP blocks, ensuring consistent data gathering from target websites.
*   **High-Quality Leads:** The built-in scoring and filtering system ensures you don't waste time on irrelevant or incomplete listings.
*   **Centralized Database:** All your leads are automatically organized in a single, easy-to-access Google Sheet.

### ⚙️ How it Works

1.  **Schedule Trigger:** The workflow starts automatically at your chosen interval (*e.g., daily*).
2.  **Set Parameters:** You define the business type (`searchCategory`) and location (`locationName`) in a central `Set` node.
3.  **Find Businesses:** It calls the **Google Places API** to get a list of businesses matching your criteria.
4.  **Score & Filter:** A custom `Function` node scores each lead. An `IF` node then separates high-quality leads from low-quality ones.
5.  **Loop & Enrich:** The workflow processes each high-quality lead one by one.
    *   It uses a scraping service (**[Scrape.do](https://scrape.do?fpr=99aed)**) to reliably fetch the lead's website content.
    *   An **AI Agent (OpenAI)** analyzes the website's footer to find contact and social media links.
6.  **Save Data:** The final, enriched lead information is appended as a new row in your Google Sheet.
