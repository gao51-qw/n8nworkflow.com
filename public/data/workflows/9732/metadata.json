  "description": "## AI-Enhanced Lead Qualification & HubSpot Synchronization (Jotform to HubSpot) 🧠✨\n\nStop wasting time on bad leads and manual research. This advanced **n8n workflow** automates your entire lead qualification and CRM entry process for HubSpot, ensuring you only sync **high-quality, pre-researched contacts**.\n\nWhen a prospect submits your form, this automation immediately:\n\n1.  **Verifies the lead's email** using Verifalia to ensure deliverability.\n2.  **Performs an AI-powered website crawl** to extract and structure key competitive information like the prospect's **Company Name**, **Industry**, **Country**, and a **Website Summary**.\n3.  **Uses Google Gemini to create an instant, personalized summary** of the lead's potential, acting as your *virtual sales assistant*.\n4.  Finally, it creates or updates the comprehensive, enhanced contact record in **HubSpot CRM** and sends a smart **Gmail notification** to your sales team with the AI summary for immediate, informed follow-up.\n\n***\n\n## How it Works\n\nThis automation turns raw form submissions into fully enriched, sales-ready contacts in HubSpot:\n\n1.  **Lead Capture (Jotform):** A prospect fills out your Jotform with their details, triggering the workflow instantly.\n2.  **Email Verification (Verifalia):** The email address is sent to the Verifalia API. **Only verified, deliverable emails are allowed to proceed**, eliminating bad data from your HubSpot portal.\n3.  **Website Crawl & Data Extraction (HTTP Request & AI):** The workflow accesses the prospect's website and uses an **Information Extractor** (powered by an underlying Language Model like Google Gemini or similar AI) to automatically pull essential business data like **Industry** and **Company Name**.\n4.  **AI Lead Scoring & Summarization (Google Gemini):** All captured and enriched data is fed to the Google Gemini model. The AI acts as a smart assistant, analyzing the lead's profile to generate a **short, prospective summary** for your sales team.\n5.  **HubSpot Synchronization:** The final, enriched contact data (including all AI-extracted fields) is used to either **create a new contact** or **update an existing one** in your **HubSpot CRM**.\n6.  **Intelligent Internal Notification (Gmail):** Your sales team receives an immediate internal email. This alert contains the raw lead data **plus the critical AI-generated summary**, allowing them to prioritize and personalize their follow-up immediately.\n\n***\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo set up this intelligent lead funnel, you'll need the following accounts and credentials configured in your n8n instance:\n\n* **Jotform Credentials:** An **API Key** for the **JotForm Trigger**. \n**Sign up for Jotform here:** [https://www.jotform.com/?partner=zainurrehman](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=zainurrehman)\n* **Verifalia Credentials:** An **API Key** for the **Lead Verification** node.\n* **AI/Language Model Credentials:** Credentials for the **Information Extractor** and **Message a model** (e.g., Google Gemini/PaLM API Key) to perform website research and summarization.\n* **HubSpot Credentials:** An **OAuth2** or **API Key** credential for the **HubSpot** node to manage contacts.\n* **Gmail Credentials:** An **OAuth2** credential for the **Gmail** node to send internal notifications.\n* **Jotform:** An active form containing the necessary fields: **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, **Phone**, **Website**, and **Note**.\n",
