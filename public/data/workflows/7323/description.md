# How it works
- Receives chat messages from customers requesting table reservations.  
- Uses an AI Agent with OpenAI Chat Model to understand and process requests.  
- Checks table information, availability, and existing reservations from Google Sheets.  
- Calculates guest counts and reservation timing using the Calculator node.  
- Updates table availability and reservation records in real-time.  
- Handles reservation changes, including updates and cancellations.

# Set up steps

- In the **AI Agent** node, link:
  - Chat Model → **OpenAI Chat Model** node.  
  - Memory → **Simple Memory** node.  
  - Tools → Calculator and Google Sheets nodes for reservation data handling.  
- Configure Google Sheets nodes:

  - **Get Table Reservations** (read sheet)  
  - **Update Table Availability** (update sheet)  
  - **Update Reservations** (append sheet)
