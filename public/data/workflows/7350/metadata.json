  "description": "**Use Case: **\nAnalyze images with multiple subjects. In this use case I have a bookshelf and am extracting and verifying book titles/authors from a bookshelf photo.\n\n**How it works: **\n1) **Webhook** receives an image url from a front end in which a user can upload a picture. \n\t- In this use case, it is an image of a book shelf.  \n2) **Edit Field (Set)**: Saves image in a consistent location so AI can find it.\n3) **Analyze Image**: Image is analyzed. \n\t- Extracts titles from the book spines \n4) **Code**: Splits extracted subjects to single item to be able to validate each item separately. \n\t- Books are individualized to their own entity\n5) **HTTP Request **validates each subject. \n\t- Queries Google Books to validate books in case only partial titles were found. \n6) **Edit Field (Set)**: Tidies the result. \n7) **Code**: Aggregates and deduplicates \n\t- Titles and authors are aggregate into a list\n8) **Respond to Webhook** returns list to front end\n\n**How to use:** \nUse with a frontend that can capture images and receive back the result. For this use case Supabase was used to store images from which the image analyzer could reference.\n",
