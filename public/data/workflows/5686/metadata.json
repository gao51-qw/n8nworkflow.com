  "description": "## Receive Webhook Notification\nThe workflow starts when a webhook receives a POST request from Whapi, notifying that a new participant has joined a WhatsApp group.\n\n## Filter the Event\nThe workflow checks two conditions:\n\nThe event is for the correct WhatsApp group (matching the specific group ID).\n\nThe action type is \"add\" (meaning a user was added to the group).\n\n## Send Welcome Message\nIf both conditions are met, the workflow sends a personalized welcome message to the new participant via Whapi.\nThe message explains the group rules and how the user can earn points and participate in weekly raffles.\n\n## Create Airtable Record\nAfter sending the welcome message, the workflow creates a new record in the Airtable database for the new participant.\nThe record includes:\n\nThe participant’s WhatsApp ID\n\nAn initial engagement count of 100 points\n\nThe date of the last interaction (set to today)\n\n## Result\nEvery new group member is automatically welcomed and registered in your engagement database with starter points, ready to participate in your group’s activities and rewards.\n\nThis workflow ensures new users are greeted, informed, and instantly included in your engagement tracking system.",
