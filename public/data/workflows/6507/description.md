Description:
Automatically send structured benign payloads (PDF/HTML/JS markers) to test email gateways and sandbox response. AI-generated phishing-style content helps simulate real-world threats without malicious intent. Results logged in Google Sheets.

## Who’s It For:
Security teams validating email filters and sandboxes

Red Teams doing payload simulation

GRC/compliance teams testing Secure Email Gateway (SEG) controls

## How It Works:
Loads target list from Google Sheets

Crafts payload using OpenAI prompt logic

Sends emails with embedded controlled markers

Logs responses back to the same sheet

## Requirements:

## Google Sheet Requirements

- Sheet Name: `Payload_Validation_Log`
- Required Columns:
  - `payload`
  - `status`
  - `response`
  - `timestamp`

Gmail/SMTP or email-sending node

Google Sheets credential

OpenAI API Key

## File Templates:
RedOps_PayloadValidator_Log_Template.xlsx – track targets, payload, status

## How to Customize:
Modify the OpenAI prompt for alternate payload types

Adjust fields or webhook triggers

Add logging to SIEM or ticketing platforms

## Detailed README:

## Purpose

Simulate benign payloads (e.g., links, encoded HTML) to test how your email security gateway and sandbox environment responds.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Test Batch**  
   Starts manually or on schedule.

2. **Get Targets**  
   Loads email recipients from Google Sheets.

3. **Generate Payload**  
   Prepares static payload like a fake link.

4. **OpenAI Node**  
   Generates a realistic simulation email using the payload.

5. **Merge + Format**  
   Combines recipient info with OpenAI output, formats the message, and tags it as simulated.

6. **Validated Node**  
   Appends results to Google Sheets with fields like:
   - `email`, `payload`, `response`, `status`, `module`, `time`

## Google Sheets Requirements

- Sheet Name: `RedOps_Targets`
- Columns: `email`, `name`, `team`, `payload`, `status`, `response`, `module`, `time`

## Security Note

This workflow uses simulated payloads and never sends real malicious content. No real user data is stored or transmitted. Meant for internal Red Team and security validation use only.
