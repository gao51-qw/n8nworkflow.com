## How It Works
This workflow automates monthly tax filing processes by retrieving financial data, performing AI-driven tax calculations, coordinating pre-filing reviews with key stakeholders, incorporating feedback, and managing overall submission readiness. It pulls accounting records, executes GPT-5–based tax calculations with transparent reasoning, formats comprehensive pre-filing reports, and routes them to a submission coordinator via email for review. The system captures reviewer feedback through structured prompts, intelligently applies necessary corrections, archives finalized records in Google Drive, and continuously tracks filing status. It is designed for accounting firms, tax practices, and finance departments that require coordinated, multi-stakeholder tax filing with minimal manual intervention.

1. Connect accounting system and configure financial data fetch parameters.
