![Workflow Overview](https://www.dr-firas.com/nanobananaPro.png)

### Who is this for?

This template is for **content creators, marketers, agencies, and UGC studios** who want to turn a simple Telegram message into **AI-generated vertical videos**, automatically published across multiple social platforms using **[Blotato](https://blotato.com/?ref=firas)**.

### What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case

Creating short-form video ads usually requires:
- Designing visuals
- Writing hooks and captions
- Generating or editing video
- Manually uploading to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, etc.

This workflow solves that by automating the full pipeline from **image + idea → edited image → AI video → multi-platform post**.

---

### What this workflow does

1. **Create Image with NanoBanana 2 PRO**  
   - User sends a photo + caption idea to a Telegram bot.  
   - OpenAI Vision analyzes the reference image.  
   - An LLM builds a UGC-style image prompt.  
   - **NanoBanana 2 PRO** generates an enhanced, UGC-friendly image.  

2. **Generate Video with VEO3.1**  
   - An AI Agent structures a detailed Veo prompt (scene, camera, lighting, audio).  
   - Prompt is optimized and sent to **VEO3.1 reference-to-video**.  
   - The result is a **9:16, ~8s vertical video** downloaded back into n8n.

3. **Publish with Blotato**  
   - Video is uploaded to **Blotato**.  
   - Posts are created for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X using the AI-generated caption, title, and hashtags.  
   - A final “Published” message is sent on Telegram.

---

### Setup

1. Create and configure:
   - **Telegram bot** (token in `Set: Bot Token (Placeholder)` node).
   - **OpenAI** credentials.
   - **Fal.ai API key** (for NanoBanana 2 PRO + VEO3.1).
   - **[Blotato](https://blotato.com/?ref=firas)** account + API credentials and connected social accounts.
2. Import the template into n8n and update all credential references.
3. Test by sending a product image + short idea to your Telegram bot.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- Edit the **UGC image prompt system message** to change visual style (more cinematic, minimal, etc.).
- Adjust the **VEO prompt optimizer** to tweak duration, mood, or camera movement.
- Enable/disable specific **Blotato platforms** depending on where you want to publish.
- Modify the caption/hashtag generation logic to match your brand tone, language, or niche.
