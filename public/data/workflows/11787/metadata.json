  "description": "## Dungeons and Goblins — AI Telegram Voice Adventure with Persistent Memory\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to use an AI agent with persistent memory to run a structured, rules-driven fantasy role-playing game entirely through Telegram voice messages. The workflow acts as a Dungeon Master, narrating scenes, resolving mechanics, performing dice rolls when authorized, and explicitly saving game state between turns.\n\n## How it works\n\n- A player actions are provided to Telegram bot via voice messages.\n\n- The AI agent loads the current game state from n8n memory.\n\n- A strict system prompt enforces rules, turn flow, and narration.\n\n- When an action requires a dice roll, the agent waits for player authorization.\n\n- Once authorized, the AI rolls, resolves the outcome, and applies changes.\n\n- All state updates are emitted as structured data and saved to memory.\n\n- The request and response are processed in Groq's STT and TTS.\n\n## Use cases\n\n- Solo text-based fantasy campaigns\n\n- Persistent AI-driven adventures\n\n- Testing stateful AI agents in n8n\n\n- Educational examples of memory-aware workflows\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Groq API token (free tier supported)\n\n- Telegram bot API token",
