# Extract invoice data from email to Google Sheets using GPT-4o AI automation

> 
Transform your invoice processing from manual data entry into an intelligent automation system. This powerful n8n workflow monitors Gmail for invoice attachments, extracts data using AI-powered analysis, and creates organized Google Sheets with all relevant financial information automatically structured and ready for your accounting workflows.

## 🔄 How It Works

This sophisticated 8-step automation eliminates manual invoice processing:

**Step 1: Intelligent Email Monitoring**
The workflow continuously monitors your Gmail account for emails with specific labels, checking every minute for new invoice attachments that need processing.

**Step 2: Attachment Verification**
Smart filtering ensures only emails with PDF attachments are processed, preventing unnecessary workflow triggers from text-only emails.

**Step 3: Advanced PDF Extraction**
The system automatically downloads and converts PDF invoices into readable text, handling various invoice formats and layouts with high accuracy.

**Step 4: AI-Powered Data Analysis**
GPT-4 processes the extracted text using specialized prompts designed for financial document analysis, identifying and extracting:
- Company information and contact details
- Invoice numbers, dates, and payment terms
- Detailed line items with quantities and pricing
- Tax calculations including CGST, SGST, and VAT
- Billing and shipping addresses
- Payment methods and transaction references

**Step 5: Structured Data Formatting**
The AI output is automatically formatted into clean, consistent JSON structure with 25+ standardized fields for comprehensive invoice tracking.

**Step 6: Dynamic Spreadsheet Creation**
Each processed invoice generates a new Google Sheets document with timestamp naming and organized data layout, ready for accounting review.

**Step 7: Automated File Organization**
Processed spreadsheets are automatically moved to designated Google Drive folders, maintaining organized file structure for easy retrieval and audit trails.

**Step 8: Data Population**
All extracted invoice data is populated into the spreadsheet with proper formatting, formulas, and structure for immediate use in accounting workflows.
