    "description": "## Overview & Setup\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to automatically generate authentic User-Generated Content (UGC) style marketing videos for eCommerce products using AI. Simply upload a product image, and the workflow creates multiple realistic influencer-style video ads complete with scripts, personas, and video generation.\n\n## Use cases\n* Generate multiple UGC video variations for A/B testing\n* Create authentic-looking product demonstrations for social media\n* Produce influencer-style content without hiring creators\n* Quickly test different marketing angles for new products\n* Scale video content creation for eCommerce catalogs\n\n## Good to know\n* Sora 2 video generation takes approximately 2-3 minutes per 12-second video\n* Each video generation costs approximately $0.50-1.00 USD (check OpenAI pricing for current rates)\n* The workflow generates multiple video variations from a single product image\n* Videos are automatically uploaded to Google Drive upon completion\n* Generated videos are in 720x1280 (9:16) format optimized for social media\n\n## How it works\n1. **Product Analysis**: OpenAI's vision API analyzes the uploaded product image to understand its features, benefits, and target audience\n2. **Persona Creation**: The system generates a detailed profile of the ideal influencer/creator who would authentically promote this product\n3. **Script Generation**: Gemini 2.5 Pro creates multiple authentic UGC video scripts (12 seconds each) with frame-by-frame breakdowns, natural dialogue, and camera movements\n4. **Frame Generation**: For each script, Gemini generates a custom first frame that adapts the product image to match UGC aesthetic and aspect ratio\n5. **Video Production**: Sora 2 API generates the actual video using the script and custom first frame as reference\n6. **Status Monitoring**: The workflow polls the video generation status every 15 seconds until completion\n7. **Upload & Storage**: Completed videos are automatically uploaded to Google Drive with organized naming\n\n## How to use\n1. Click the form trigger URL to access the submission form\n2. Upload your product image (works best with clean product shots on white/neutral backgrounds)\n3. Enter the product name\n4. Submit the form and wait for the workflow to complete\n5. Find your generated UGC videos in the specified Google Drive folder\n6. Each run produces multiple video variations you can test\n\n## Requirements\n* **OpenAI API** account with Sora 2 access for video generation and GPT-4 Vision\n* **Google Gemini API** account for script generation and image adaptation\n* **Google Drive** account for video storage\n* Sufficient API credits for video generation (budget accordingly)\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n* Adjust the **video duration** in the generate_video node (currently set to 12 seconds)\n* Modify the **persona prompt** in analyze_product node to target different audience demographics\n* Change the **script style** in set_build_video_prompts node for different UGC aesthetics (excited discovery, casual recommendation, etc.)\n* Update the **Google Drive folder** in upload_video node to organize videos by campaign\n* Add **additional processing** nodes for video editing, subtitle generation, or thumbnail creation\n* Modify the **aspect ratio** in resize_image node for different platforms (1:1 for Instagram feed, 16:9 for YouTube, etc.)",

No text overlays. No polish. Just real.\nYour goal: Create exactly 12-second video scripts with frame-by-frame detail that feel like genuine content someone would post, not manufactured ads.\n\nYou will be provided with an image that includes a reference to the product, but the entire ad should be a UGC-style (User Generated Content) video that gets created and scripted for. The first frame is going to be just the product, but you need to change away and then go into the rest of the video.\n\nThe Raw iPhone Aesthetic\nWhat we WANT:\n\nHandheld shakiness and natural camera movement\nPhone shifting as they talk/gesture with their hands\nCamera readjusting mid-video (zooming in closer, tilting, refocusing)\nOne-handed filming while using product with the other hand\nNatural bobbing/swaying as they move or talk\nFilming wherever they actually are (messy room, car, bathroom mirror, kitchen counter)\nReal lighting (window light, lamp, overhead—not \"good\" lighting)\nAuthentic imperfections (finger briefly covering lens, focus hunting, unexpected background moments)\n\nWhat we AVOID:\n\nTripods or stable surfaces (no locked-down shots)\nText overlays or on-screen graphics (NONE—let the talking do the work)\nPerfect framing that stays consistent\nProfessional transitions or editing\nClean, styled backgrounds\nMultiple takes stitched together feeling\nScripted-sounding delivery or brand speak\n\n\nThe 12-Second Structure (Loose)\n0-2 seconds:\nStart talking/showing immediately—like mid-conversation\nCamera might still be adjusting as they find the angle\nHook them with a relatable moment or immediate product reveal\n2-9 seconds:\nShow the product in action while continuing to talk naturally\nCamera might move closer, pull back, or shift as they demonstrate\nThis is where the main demo/benefit happens organically\n9-12 seconds:\nWrap up thought while product is still visible\nNatural ending—could trail off, quick recommendation, or casual sign-off\nDialogue must finish by the 12-second mark\n\nCritical: NO Invented Details\n\nOnly use the exact Product Name provided\nOnly reference what's visible in the Product Image\nOnly use the Creator Profile details given\nDo not create slogans, brand messaging, or fake details\nStay true to what the product actually does based on the image\n\n\nYour Inputs\nProduct Image: First image in this conversation\nCreator Profile:\n{{ $node['set_model_details'].json.prompt }}\nProduct Name:\n{{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}\n\nOutput: 3 Natural Scripts\nThree different authentic approaches:\n\nExcited Discovery - Just found it, have to share\nCasual Recommendation - Talking to camera like a friend\nIn-the-Moment Demo - Showing while using it\n\n\nFormat for each script:\nSCRIPT [#]: [Simple angle in 3-5 words]\nThe energy: [One specific line - excited? Chill? Matter-of-fact? Caffeinated? Half-awake?]\nWhat they say to camera (with timestamps):\n[0:00-0:02] \"[Opening line - 3-5 words, mid-thought energy]\"\n[0:02-0:09] \"[Main talking section - 20-25 words total. Include natural speech patterns like 'like,' 'literally,' 'I don't know,' pauses, self-corrections. Sound conversational, not rehearsed.]\"\n[0:09-0:12] \"[Closing thought - 3-5 words.

frame: [Ex: \"Closer shot of product in use, background blurred\"]\nCreator action: [Ex: \"Applying product to face/hand/surface naturally\"]\nProduct interaction: [Ex: \"Dispensing product, showing texture/consistency\"]\nPhysical details: [Ex: \"Product texture visible, their expression reacting to feel/smell\"]\nAudio cue: [What they're saying, might include natural pause or 'um']\n\nSECOND 5-6:\n\nCamera position: [Ex: \"Pulling back to shoulder height\"]\nCamera movement: [Ex: \"Readjusting frame, slight pan left\"]\nWhat's in frame: [Ex: \"Face and product both visible, more balanced

feature\"]\nProduct highlight: [Ex: \"Finger tapping on label/size/specific element\"]\nAudio cue: [What they're saying]\n\nSECOND 8-9:\n\nCamera position: [Ex: \"Back to face level, slightly closer than before\"]\nCamera movement: [Ex: \"Wobbling as they emphasize point with hand gesture\"]\nWhat's in frame: [Ex: \"Face takes up most of frame, product visible bottom right\"]\nCreator action: [Ex: \"Nodding while talking, genuine expression\"]\nProduct visibility: [Ex: \"Product remains in shot naturally, not forced\"]\nAudio cue: [What they're saying, building to conclusion]\n\nSECOND 9-10:\n\nCamera position: [Ex: \"Pulling back to show full setup\"]\nCamera movement: [Ex: \"Slight drop in angle as they relax grip\"]\nWhat's in frame: [Ex: \"Upper body and product together, casual end stance\"]\nCreator action: [Ex: \"Shrugging, smiling, casual body language\"]\nProduct visibility: [Ex: \"Product sitting on counter/still in hand casually\"]\nAudio cue: [Final words

\"Face, partial product view, casual ending\"]\nCreator action: [Ex: \"Small wave / half-smile / looking away naturally\"]\nHow it ends: [Ex: \"Cuts off mid-movement\" / \"Fade as they lower phone\" / \"Abrupt stop\"]\nFinal audio: [Last word/sound trails off naturally]\n\nOverall Technical Details:\n\nPhone orientation: [Vertical/horizontal?]\nFilming method: [Selfie mode facing them? Back camera in mirror? Someone else holding phone? Propped on stack of books?]\nDominant hand: [Which hand holds phone vs. product?]\nLocation specifics: [What room? Time of day based on lighting? Any notable background elements?]\nAudio environment: [Echo from bathroom? Quiet bedroom? Background TV/music? Street noise?]\n\n\nEnhanced Authenticity Guidelines\nVerbal Authenticity:\n\nUse filler words: \"like,\" \"literally,\" \"so,\" \"I mean,\" \"honestly\"\nInclude natural pauses: \"It's just... really good\"\nSelf-corrections: \"It's really—well actually it's more like...\"\nConversational fragments: \"Yeah so this thing...\"\nRegional speech patterns if relevant to creator profile\n\nVisual Authenticity Markers:\n\nFinger briefly covering part of lens\nCamera focus hunting between face and product\nSlight overexposure from window light\nBackground \"real life\" moments (pet, person, notification pop-up)\nNatural product handling (not perfect grip, repositioning)\n\nTiming Authenticity:\n\nSlight rushing at the end to fit in last thought\nNatural breath pauses\nTalking speed varies (faster when excited, slower when showing detail)\nMight start sentence at 11 seconds that gets cut at 12\n\n\nRemember: Every second matters. The more specific the shot breakdown, the more authentic the final video feels. If a detail seems too polished, make it messier. No text overlays ever. All dialogue must finish by the 12-second mark (can trail off naturally)."

Simply upload a product image, and the workflow creates multiple realistic influencer-style video ads complete with scripts, personas, and video generation.\n\n## Use cases\n* Generate multiple UGC video variations for A/B testing\n* Create authentic-looking product demonstrations for social media\n* Produce influencer-style content without hiring creators\n* Quickly test different marketing angles for new products\n* Scale video content creation for eCommerce catalogs\n\n## Good to know\n* Sora 2 video generation takes approximately 2-3 minutes per 12-second video\n* Each video generation costs approximately $0.50-1.00 USD (check OpenAI pricing for current rates)\n* The workflow generates multiple video variations from a single product image\n* Videos are automatically uploaded to Google Drive upon completion\n* Generated videos are in 720x1280 (9:16) format optimized for social media\n\n## How it works\n1. **Product Analysis**: OpenAI's vision API analyzes the uploaded product image to understand its features, benefits, and target audience\n2. **Persona Creation**: The system generates a detailed profile of the ideal influencer/creator who would authentically promote this product\n3. **Script Generation**: Gemini 2.5 Pro creates multiple authentic UGC video scripts (12 seconds each) with frame-by-frame breakdowns, natural dialogue, and camera movements\n4. **Frame Generation**: For each script, Gemini generates a custom first frame that adapts the product image to match UGC aesthetic and aspect ratio\n5. **Video Production**: Sora 2 API generates the actual video using the script and custom first frame as reference\n6. **Status Monitoring**: The workflow polls the video generation status every 15 seconds until completion\n7. **Upload & Storage**: Completed videos are automatically uploaded to Google Drive with organized naming\n\n## How to use\n1. Click the form trigger URL to access the submission form\n2. Upload your product image (works best with clean product shots on white/neutral backgrounds)\n3. Enter the product name\n4. Submit the form and wait for the workflow to complete\n5. Find your generated UGC videos in the specified Google Drive folder\n6. Each run produces multiple video variations you can test\n\n## Requirements\n* **OpenAI API** account with Sora 2 access for video generation and GPT-4 Vision\n* **Google Gemini API** account for script generation and image adaptation\n* **Google Drive** account for video storage\n* Sufficient API credits for video generation (budget accordingly)\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n* Adjust the **video duration** in the generate_video node (currently set to 12 seconds)\n* Modify the **persona prompt** in analyze_product node to target different audience demographics\n* Change the **script style** in set_build_video_prompts node for different UGC aesthetics (excited discovery, casual recommendation, etc.)\n* Update the **Google Drive folder** in upload_video node to organize videos by campaign\n* Add **additional processing** nodes for video editing, subtitle generation, or thumbnail creation\n* Modify the **aspect ratio** in resize_image node for different platforms (1:1 for Instagram feed, 16:9 for YouTube, etc.)"
