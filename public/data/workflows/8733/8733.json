Fill in app details:\n   - App name: `AWS News Automation`\n   - LinkedIn Page: Select your company page\n   - App logo: Upload your logo\n   - Legal agreement: Accept terms\n\n**Step 2: Configure OAuth2 Settings**\n1. In your app, go to **Auth** tab\n2. Add redirect URL: `https://your-n8n-instance.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`\n3. Request these scopes:\n   - `w_member_social` (Post on behalf of members)\n   - `r_liteprofile` (Read basic profile)\n   - `r_emailaddress` (Read email address)\n\n**Step 3: Get Company Page Access**\n1. Go to your [LinkedIn Company Page](ex. https://www.linkedin.com/company/105783641)\n2. Navigate to **Admin tools** → **Manage admins**\n3. Ensure you have **Content admin** or **Super admin** role\n4. Note your **Company Page ID** (found in page URL)\n\n**Step 4: Configure LinkedIn Credentials in n8n**\n1. Add **LinkedIn OAuth2** credential\n2. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret\n3. Complete OAuth2 flow by clicking **Connect my account**\n4. Select your company page for posting\n\n**Useful Links:**\n- [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)\n- [LinkedIn API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/)\n- [LinkedIn OAuth2 Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow)\n\n#### 4.
