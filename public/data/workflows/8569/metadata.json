  "description": "## 🚀 Overview  \nThis modern n8n workflow implements a **multi-agent trading engine** that orchestrates valuation, sentiment, fundamentals, technicals, and macro analyses to generate a single portfolio action with built-in risk controls. It integrates Telegram for live commands, fetches market data, fans out to expert LLM agents, applies position limits via a Risk Manager, executes orders, logs to Notion, and sends a summary back to Telegram.  \n\n## 🔧 What It Does  \n- **Telegram Trigger** listens for ticker commands and context inputs 📲  \n- **Market Data Node** fetches live prices and exchange rates from an API (no hardcoded keys) 🔗  \n- **LLM Agents** run parallel analyses: valuation, sentiment, macro, fundamentals, technicals 🌐  \n- **Risk Manager** enforces max position sizes, stop-loss limits, and confidence thresholds ⚖️  \n- **Portfolio Manager** aggregates signals into a final BUY/SELL/HOLD decision with allocation % 📊  \n- **Execute Order** sends trade requests via HTTP Request 🔒  \n- **Log to Notion** writes a full audit trail for compliance 📓  \n- **Telegram Output** posts a concise report with signals, risk notes, and final decision 📤  \n\n## 💡 Why It’s Useful  \nThis template illustrates a **modular “investment committee”** architecture that is easy to extend, swap agents, and maintain. It follows n8n’s best practices for template submissions: sticky-note documentation, placeholder credentials, markdown descriptions, and clear H2 headings.  \n\n## 🔑 Prerequisites  \n- Telegram Bot credentials configured in n8n  \n- Exchange or data API credentials stored as n8n Credentials (no inline keys)  \n- OpenAI (or other LLM) API credential  \n- Notion integration credentials  \n\n## 🛠️ How to Use  \n1. Import the JSON into n8n and open the canvas.  \n2. Read each **Sticky Note** for node-by-node setup tips and rate-limit guidance 🗒️  \n3. Configure credentials via the n8n Credentials Manager 🔐  \n4. Test each branch (data fetch, agents, risk logic) in isolation before enabling order execution ✅  \n\n## 📐 Architecture Layers  \n- **Trigger**: Telegram Trigger →  \n- **Data**: HTTP Request →  \n- **Analysis**: Parallel LLM Agents →  \n- **Risk**: Risk Manager →  \n- **Decision**: Portfolio Manager →  \n- **Action**: Execute Order, Log to Notion, Send Telegram summary  \n\n## 🔒 Security & Maintenance  \nAll API keys are stored securely as credentials. Sticky Notes document required scopes, retry strategies, and error-handling paths to ensure observability and safe testing.  \n\nEnjoy building and customizing your own AI-powered hedge-fund workflow!",
