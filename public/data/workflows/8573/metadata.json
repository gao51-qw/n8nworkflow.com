  "description": "# ForumPulse for n8n – Daily Pulse & On-demand Deep Dives\n\n**Author:** Nguyen Thieu Toan  \n**Category:** Community & Knowledge Automation  \n**Tags:** Telegram, Reddit, n8n Forum, AI Summarization, Gemini, Groq\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nForumPulse is an AI-powered assistant that keeps you connected to the latest discussions around **n8n**.  \nThe workflow integrates **Reddit (r/n8n)** and the **n8n Community Forum**, fetches trending and recent posts, and uses **Gemini/Groq AI models** to generate clean, structured summaries.  \n\nIt works in two complementary modes:\n\n1. **Daily Pulse (Automated Digest):**  \n   Runs on schedule (default: 8:00 AM) to gather highlights and deliver a concise summary directly to your Telegram.\n\n2. **On-demand Deep Dive (Interactive):**  \n   Listens to Telegram queries in real-time, detects intent (search, deep dive, open link, or chat), and provides summaries, comments, and insights for any chosen post.  \n\nWhen AI intent detection confidence drops below `0.7`, the bot automatically asks for clarification before proceeding—ensuring accuracy and transparency.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n### 1. Setup & Prerequisites\n- **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted).  \n- **Telegram Bot** (created via BotFather).  \n- **MongoDB** (optional, for persistent memory).  \n- **API keys** for Gemini and Groq.  \n- **Your Telegram user ID** (to receive replies).  \n\n⚠️ Replace all test credentials and tokens with your own. Never commit real secrets into exported templates.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Daily Pulse Automation\n- **Schedule Trigger** runs the workflow every morning at the configured time.  \n- **Reddit + Forum Search** collects hot/new topics.  \n- **Merge Results** combines both sources into a unified dataset.  \n- **AI Summarizer Overview** condenses the results into a short, engaging digest.  \n- **Telegram Output** delivers the digest, automatically split into safe chunks under 2000 characters.\n\n---\n\n### 3. On-demand Interaction\n- **Telegram Trigger** listens for incoming messages.  \n- **Intent Analysis (AI Agent)** classifies the query as *Search | Open Link | Deep Dive | Chitchat*.  \n- **Confidence Gate**: if confidence &lt; 0.7, sends a clarification prompt to the user.  \n- **Branch by Intent**:  \n  - *Search*: Query Reddit/Forum with filters.  \n  - *Open Link*: Fetch details of a specific post.  \n  - *Deep Dive*: Retrieve comments and metadata.  \n  - *Chitchat*: Respond conversationally.  \n- **AI Summarizer** structures the output, highlighting trends, issues, and takeaways.  \n- **Telegram Delivery** formats and sends the reply, respecting HTML tags and message length.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Deep Dive Details\n- **Post Extraction** fetches titles, authors, timestamps, and stats.  \n- **Comment Parsing** organizes replies into structured data.  \n- **Merge Post + Comments** builds a complete context package.  \n- **Summarizer** produces detailed, actionable insights.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Error Handling & Safety\n- **Confidence Check** prevents wrong answers by requiring clarification.  \n- **Error Paths** handle API downtime or unexpected formats gracefully.  \n- **Auto Chunking** avoids Telegram’s message length cap (2000 chars).  \n- **Safe Defaults** ensure fallback queries when inputs are missing or unclear.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options\n\n- **Sources**: Add or replace platforms by editing HTTP Request nodes.  \n- **Schedule**: Change the cron time in the Schedule Trigger (e.g., 7:30 AM).  \n- **Filters**: Adjust default sort order, time ranges, and result limits.  \n- **AI Persona**: Reword the `systemMessage` in AI Agent nodes to change tone (professional, casual, emoji-rich).  \n- **Languages**: Auto-detects user language, but you can force English or Vietnamese by editing prompt settings.  \n- **Memory**: Enable MongoDB nodes for persistent user context across sessions.  \n- **Integrations**: Extend beyond Telegram—send digests to Slack, Discord, or email.  \n- **Models**: Swap Gemini/Groq with other supported LLMs for experimentation.  \n\n---\n\n✨ Crafted by **Nguyen Thieu Toan** with a focus on clarity, reliability, and community-driven insights.  \nThis workflow is not just functional - it reflects a design philosophy: automation should feel natural, transparent, and genuinely useful.\n",
