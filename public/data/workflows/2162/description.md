This n8n workflow is designed for working with the WhatsApp Business platform. It allows to send custom replies via WhatsApp in response to incoming user messages. 

💡 Take a look at the step-by-step tutorial on [how to create a WhatsApp bot](https://blog.n8n.io/whatsapp-bot/).

The workflow consists of two parts:
 
1. The first Verify webhook sends back verification challenge string. You will need this part during the setup process on the Meta for Developers portal:

2. Once the webhook is verified, the Respond webhook receives various POST requests from Meta regarding WhatsApp messages (user messages and status notifications). 

The workflow checks whether the incoming JSON contains a user message. If this is the case, it sends the text message back to the user. This is a custom message, not a WhatsApp Business template.
