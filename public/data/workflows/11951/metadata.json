  "description": "## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow implements a two-stage news automation system\ndesigned for reusable and topic-driven email delivery.\nNews articles are continuously collected from multiple platforms\nusing RSS feeds and stored in a vector database with semantic\nembeddings and category metadata.\n\nInstead of fetching news on demand, the workflow separates\ndaily ingestion from weekly delivery. This allows the same\nnews data to be reused across different topics, audiences,\nor delivery schedules.\n\nOn a weekly basis, relevant articles are retrieved from the\nvector store based on defined areas of interest and item limits.\nThe selected news is then processed by an AI agent, which\nconverts the raw articles into a structured, email-ready format\nbefore sending the final content to users.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. News articles are collected daily from multiple RSS feeds\n2. Articles are categorized and stored in a vector database\n3. On a weekly trigger, topic preferences are evaluated\n4. Relevant articles are retrieved using vector-based search\n5. An AI agent formats the content for email delivery\n6. The email is sent to the user\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use this workflow, complete the following steps:\n\n1. Add and configure your RSS feed sources\n2. Connect a vector database and embedding model\n3. Configure AI model credentials for content generation\n4. Set up email service credentials\n5. Define weekly scheduling and topic inputs\n6. Test retrieval and email output\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize this workflow by:\n\n- Adding or removing RSS feed sources\n- Adjusting news categories or topic filters\n- Changing the number of articles retrieved per topic\n- Modifying the AI agent’s writing tone or structure\n- Reusing the vector store for other content workflows\n- Updating email frequency or delivery format\n\n## Requirements\n\n- RSS feed URLs\n- Vector database credentials\n- AI model credentials\n- Email service credentials\n",
