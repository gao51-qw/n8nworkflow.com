# Purpose & Audience
Forex Market AI Analyst is an advanced n8n workflow template designed for Forex traders, analysts, prop firms, brokers, and trading communities who need real-time, actionable market intelligence.

2. Filters news by recency and relevance, ensuring only the most current and impactful headlines are included.
3. Analyzes market sentiment (bullish, bearish, or neutral) using a state-of-the-art language model (LLM).
4. Summarizes key themes, technical levels, and economic drivers in a clear, structured format with visual cues.
5. Delivers updates to your chosen Discord channel or chat group, with two distinct modes:
**Quick Alerts:** Fast, headline-focused updates for daily trading.
