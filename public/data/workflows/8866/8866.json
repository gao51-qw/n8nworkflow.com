    "description": "### Send VAPI voice requests into n8n with memory and OpenAI for conversational automation\n\nThis template shows how to capture **voice interactions from VAPI (Voice AI Platform)**, send them into n8n via a webhook, process them with OpenAI, and maintain context with memory. The result is a conversational AI agent that responds back to VAPI with short, business-focused answers.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ What this template does\n- Listens for **POST requests** from VAPI containing the session ID and user query  \n- Extracts session ID and query for consistent conversation context  \n- Uses **OpenAI (GPT-4.1-mini)** to generate conversational replies  \n- Adds **Memory Buffer Window** so each VAPI session maintains history  \n- Returns results to VAPI in the correct JSON response format  \n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who’s it for\n- Developers and consultants building **voice-driven assistants**  \n- Businesses wanting to connect **VAPI calls into automation workflows**  \n- Anyone who needs a **scalable voice → AI → automation pipeline**  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n1. **Webhook node** catches incoming VAPI requests  \n2. **Set node** extracts `session_id` and `user_query` from the request body  \n3. **OpenAI Agent** generates short, conversational replies with your business context  \n4. **Memory node** keeps conversation history across turns  \n5. **Respond to Webhook** sends results back to VAPI in the required JSON schema  \n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup instructions\n\n### Step 1: Create Function Tool in VAPI\n1. In your VAPI dashboard, create a new **Function Tool**  \n   - **Name**: `send_to_n8n`  \n   - **Description**: Send user query and session data to n8n workflow  \n   - **Parameters**:  \n     - `session_id` (string, required) – Unique session identifier  \n     - `user_query` (string, required) – The user’s question  \n   - **Server URL**: `https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/vapi-endpoint`  \n\n### Step 2: Configure Webhook in n8n\n1. Add a **Webhook node**  \n2. Set HTTP method to `POST`  \n3. Path: `/webhook/vapi-endpoint`  \n4. Save, activate, and copy the webhook URL  \n5. Use this URL in your VAPI Function Tool configuration  \n\n### Step 3: Create VAPI Assistant\n1. In VAPI, create a new **Assistant**  \n2. Add the `send_to_n8n` Function Tool  \n3. Configure the assistant to call this tool on user requests  \n4. Test by making a voice query — you should see n8n respond  \n\n---\n\n## 📦 Requirements\n- An **OpenAI API key** stored in n8n credentials  \n- A **VAPI account** with access to Function Tools  \n- A self-hosted or cloud n8n instance with webhook access  \n\n---\n\n## 🎛 Customization\n- Update the **system prompt** in the OpenAI Agent node to reflect your brand’s voice  \n- Swap GPT-4.1-mini for another OpenAI model if you need longer or cheaper responses  \n- Extend the workflow by connecting to **CRMs, Slack, or databases**  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact  \nNeed help customizing this (e.g., filtering by campaign, connecting to CRMs, or formatting reports)?  \n\n- 📧 **rbreen@ynteractive.com**  \n- 🔗 **https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/**  \n- 🌐 **https://ynteractive.com**  \n",
