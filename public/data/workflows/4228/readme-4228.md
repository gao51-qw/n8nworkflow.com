# Transform raw hiring transcripts into briefs & scorecards with AI and Google Docs

> ## Who is this template for ?

Basically anyone involved in recurring recruiting processes and looking to save a considerable amount of time and energy (Talent acquisitions Managers, recruiting consultants, hiring managers, founders…etc)

## What it does :

- It takes a messy and raw transcript from an “intake meeting” between a recruiter and a Hiring manager and turns it into a **clean and exhaustive brief + scorecard templates for each interview rounds**
- It does it under 1 MINUTE while the usual “manual” process usually takes several hours

## How to customize this workflow to your needs

- Google doc is the default choice because it allows easy modification of the output, but you can choose to output this under any format and / or store it wherever you want
- I strongly suggest to choose one of the latest LLM models for better output quality
- Both LLM prompts can be revised to match your expectations better
