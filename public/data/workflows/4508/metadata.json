  "description": "## Multi-Platform AI Sales Agent with RAG, CRM Logging & Appointment Booking\n\nThis workflow acts as a 24/7 sales agent, engaging leads across **WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, and your website**. It intelligently transcribes audio messages, answers questions using a knowledge base, and uses modular sub-workflows to manage your CRM in **Airtable** and book appointments in **Google Calendar**.\n\n---\n\n## Who Is It For?\n\nThis solution is designed for **service-based businesses** that require a sophisticated, multi-channel lead management and appointment booking system.\n* **Agencies, consultants, and clinics** looking to automate lead qualification and booking across text and voice messages.\n* **Sales teams** needing a robust system that separates CRM and calendar logic for easier management and scalability.\n* **Advanced n8n users** who want a powerful, agent-based framework that can be easily customized and extended.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features & Workflow\n\nThis system is composed of a parent workflow that orchestrates the conversation and calls specialized sub-workflows (agents) to perform specific tasks.\n\n* **Omni-Channel Engagement:** Greets and converses with leads naturally on **Website Chat, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Telegram**.\n* **Voice Message Transcription:** Automatically transcribes incoming audio/voice notes from **WhatsApp and Telegram** into text, allowing the AI to understand and respond without manual intervention.\n* **RAG-Powered Intelligence:** The AI agent draws answers from your dedicated **PostgreSQL Knowledge Base (RAG)**, providing accurate information about your services, pricing, and process. A built-in tool allows you to load new knowledge documents from Google Drive.\n* **Modular CRM Agent (Sub-Workflow):** When the conversation requires CRM actions (like creating a contact or updating an opportunity), the main agent calls a dedicated **Airtable CRM sub-workflow** to handle the task.\n* **Modular Calendar Agent (Sub-Workflow):** To book appointments, the main agent calls a separate **Google Calendar sub-workflow**, which manages event creation, updates, and deletions.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need\n\nThis workflow framework requires credentials for the following services:\n* An AI provider (**OpenAI** is used for the main agent, transcription, and embeddings).\n* **PostgreSQL** database with the `pgvector` extension (for RAG and chat memory).\n* **Airtable** account (for the CRM sub-workflow).\n* **Google Calendar** account (for the Calendar sub-workflow).\n* **Telegram Bot** credentials.\n* A **Meta Developer Account** (for WhatsApp, Instagram & Facebook).\n* (Optional) **Google Drive** for loading knowledge documents.\n* (Optional) **Google Gemini** for embeddings.\n\n---\n\n## How to Set It Up\n\n**This is a modular system. You must set up the sub-workflows first.**\n\n1.  **Deploy Sub-Workflows:** Create **two new, separate workflows** using the provided templates for the **CRM Agent** and the **Calendar Agent**. Configure the credentials (Airtable, Google Calendar) within those workflows, then **save and activate them**.\n2.  **Link Sub-Workflows in Main Workflow:** Return to this main workflow. In the **\"CRM Agent\"** and **\"Consultation Agent\"** tool nodes, select the new workflows you just created from the dropdown list.\n3.  **Configure Main Credentials:** Securely add the remaining credentials (**OpenAI, PostgreSQL, Telegram,** and your **Meta App**) in this main workflow.\n4.  **Personalize the AI Agent:** In the **\"Update Agent Details\"** node, fill in your business name, the agent's persona name, and your key services to customize the AI's personality.\n5.  **Load Your Knowledge (Optional):** To populate the RAG database, use the manual trigger path starting with **\"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’\"** to download a document from Google Drive and insert it into your PostgreSQL vector store.\n6.  **Activate:** Configure your channel-specific details (e.g., Phone Number ID in WhatsApp nodes), save the workflow, and activate it.\n\n---\n**Demo CRM Table:** [View on Airtable](https://airtable.com/app7cw2dSfW9Y8Fg9/shrZ08N5Im3SDzTou/tbl3yCddn8oTpBIX3/viwm20KsStVhawr4s?blocks=bipG9pIosCb4tPbcG)\n",
