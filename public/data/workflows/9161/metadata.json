  "description": "# Customer Support AI Agent for Gmail  \n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to build an **AI-powered customer support workflow** that automatically handles incoming Gmail messages, classifies them, finds answers from your knowledge base, and sends a personalized reply.  \n\n## Who’s it for  \n- SaaS founders or teams who want to automate customer support.  \n- Freelancers and solopreneurs who receive repetitive customer queries.  \n- Companies that want to reduce manual email triage and improve response times.  \n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Trigger**: A new email arrives in Gmail.  \n2. **Classification**: The workflow uses a text classifier to decide whether the email is customer support-related or not.  \n   - If not, it’s ignored.  \n   - If yes, it proceeds.  \n3. **AI Agent**:  \n   - Queries a knowledge base (vector database with OpenAI embeddings).  \n   - Retrieves the most relevant answer.  \n   - Drafts a reply using AI (OpenAI or Google Gemini model).  \n4. **Post-processing**:  \n   - Labels the email in Gmail for organization.  \n   - Sends a reply automatically.  \n\nThis ensures that your customers get timely, relevant responses without manual intervention.  \n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import this template into your n8n account.  \n2. Connect your **Gmail account** in the Gmail Trigger, Label, and Reply nodes.  \n3. Connect your **AI model provider** (OpenAI or Google Gemini).  \n4. Configure the **knowledge base embeddings** (upload your docs/FAQ into the vector database).  \n5. Activate the workflow — and your AI customer support agent is live!  \n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n account.  \n- Gmail account (with API access enabled).  \n- OpenAI or Google Gemini account for LLM and embeddings.  \n- Knowledge base data (FAQ, documentation, or past tickets).  \n- Google Drive account for auto update your vector database(with API access enabled).\n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- **Knowledge Base**: Replace or expand with your own company docs, FAQs, or past conversations.  \n- **Classification Rules**: Train or adjust the classifier to handle more categories (e.g., Sales, Partnership, Technical Support).  \n- **Reply Style**: Customize AI prompts for tone — professional, casual, or friendly.  \n- **Labels**: Change Gmail labels to match your workflow (e.g., “Support,” “Sales,” “Priority”).  \n- **Multi-language**: Add translation steps if your customers speak different languages.  \n\n---\n\nThis template saves you hours of manual email triage and ensures your customers always get quick, accurate responses.  \n",
