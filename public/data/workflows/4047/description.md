# Production Features

- **Scaling Design** for n8n **Queue mode** in production environment

- Optional **Score** design output
- Optimize **Taxi Provider Prompt** from database
- **Error Management**

# What this workflow does?

This is a n8n **Taxi Provider Workflow** demo. It will receive message from the **Taxi Service Workflow**, process the estimation and return to the caller.

# **How it works**

- The **Flow Trigger** node will wait for the message from other Sub-workflow.
- When message is received, it will first check for the matching **Provider** from the PostgreSQL database.
- Then it will increase a **Provider Number** in Redis for selection later
- Trigger a **AI Agent** to process the fare estimation and create a **NEW booking**
- Finally, send the AI response to the **Call Output**
- Note: if the **Provider** is set to inactive, it will do nothing

# **Set up instructions**

1. Pull and Set up the required SQL from our [Github repository](https://github.com/ChatPayLabs/n8n-chatbot-core).
2. Create you **Redis credentials**, refer to [n8n integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=credential_settings&utm_campaign=create_new_credentials_modal) for more information.
3. Select your Credentials in **Provider Cache,** **Save Provider Cache** and **Provider Number**.
4. Create you **Postgres credentials**, refer to [n8n integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=credential_settings&utm_campaign=create_new_credentials_modal) for more information.
5. Select your Credentials in **Load Provider Data** and **Create Booking Data.**
6. Modify the **AI Agent** prompt to fit your need

# How to adjust it to your needs

1. By default, this template will use the **sys_provider** table provider information, you could change it for your own design.
2. You can use any **AI Model** for the **AI Agent** node
3. Include is our prompt for the taxi service provider. It is a flexible design which use the data from the **Provider Cache** to customize the prompt, so you could create more **Taxi Service Providers** by duplicate this workflow in the **Taxi Service** node.
