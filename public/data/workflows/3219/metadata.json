  "description": "This workflow helps you generate an **llms.txt** file (if you're unfamiliar with it, check out [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/llms-txt-414d5121bcb3/)) using a **Screaming Frog export**.  \n\n[Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) is a well-known website crawler.  \nYou can easily crawl a website. Then, export the **\"internal_html\"** section in CSV format.  \n\n## How It Works: \n\nA **form** allows you to enter:  \n- The **name of the website**  \n- A **short description**  \n- The **internal_html.csv** file from your Screaming Frog export  \n\n\nOnce the form is submitted, the **workflow is triggered automatically**, and you can **download the llms.txt file directly from n8n**. \n\n## Downloading the File\nSince the last node in this workflow is **\"Convert to File\"**, you will need to **download the file directly from the n8n UI**.  \nHowever, you can easily **add a node** (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) to automatically upload the file **wherever you want**.  \n\n## AI-Powered Filtering (Optional):  \nThis workflow includes a **text classifier node**, which is **deactivated by default**.  \n- You can **activate it** to apply a more **intelligent filter** to select URLs for the `llms.txt` file.  \n- Consider modifying the **description** in the classifier node to specify the type of URLs you want to include.  \n\n## How to Use This Workflow  \n\n1. **Crawl the website** you want to generate an `llms.txt` file for using **Screaming Frog**.  \n2. **Export the \"internal_html\"** section in CSV format.  \n   ![Screaming Frog internal html export](https://i.imgur.com/M0nJQiV.png)  \n3. In **n8n**, click **\"Test Workflow\"**, fill in the form, and **upload** the `internal_html.csv` file.  \n4. Once the workflow is complete, go to the **\"Export to File\"** node and **download the output**.  \n\n**That's it! You now have your llms.txt file!**  \n\n\n\n**Recommended Usage:**  \nUse this workflow **directly in the n8n UI by clicking** 'Test Workflow' and uploading the file in the form.",
