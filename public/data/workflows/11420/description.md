# Send AI-personalized LinkedIn connection requests from Google Sheets using ConnectSafely.AI API

## Who's it for

This workflow is built for sales professionals, recruiters, founders, and growth marketers who want to scale their LinkedIn outreach without sacrificing personalization. Perfect for anyone tired of sending generic connection requests that get ignored, or manually crafting individual messages for hundreds of prospects.

If you're running ABM campaigns, building a sales pipeline, recruiting talent, or expanding your professional network, this automation handles the heavy lifting while keeping your outreach authentic and human.

## How it works

The workflow automates personalized LinkedIn connection requests by combining Google Sheets prospect tracking with AI-powered message generation through ConnectSafely.ai's API.

**The process flow:**
1. Reads pending prospects from your Google Sheet
2. Immediately marks them "IN PROGRESS" to prevent duplicate sends
3. Fetches complete LinkedIn profile data via ConnectSafely.ai API
4. Generates a personalized, authentic message using Google Gemini AI
5. Sends the connection request with your custom message
6. Updates your sheet with "DONE" status and stores the message sent

Random delays between requests mimic human behavior and maintain LinkedIn compliance.

## Setup steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Google Sheet

```
MY CONTEXT:
[CUSTOMIZE THIS: Add your name, role, and what you're looking for in connections]
```

With your actual information, for example:

```
MY CONTEXT:
I'm Sarah, founder of a B2B SaaS startup. I'm interested in connecting with other founders, VCs, and sales leaders to exchange ideas and explore potential partnerships.
```

## Customization

### Message Personalization

Edit the system prompt in the **Generate Personalized Message** node to adjust:

- **Tone**: Formal, casual, or industry-specific language
- **Length**: Modify character limits (LinkedIn allows up to 300 characters)
- **Focus**: Emphasize mutual connections, shared interests, or achievements
- **Sign-off**: Change the signature format to match your brand

### Timing Adjustments

- **Schedule Trigger**: Currently set to run every minute. Adjust the interval in the **Run Every Minute** node
- **Random Delay**: The **Random Delay (1-5 min)** node adds 1-5 minutes of random wait time. Modify the formula `{{ Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1 }}` to change the range

### Rate Limiting Best Practices

- Start with 10-20 connection requests per day
- Gradually increase over 2-3 weeks
- Never exceed 100 requests per day
- Consider pausing on weekends

## Use Cases

- **Sales Prospecting**: Connect with decision-makers at target accounts with personalized outreach
- **Recruiting**: Reach out to passive candidates with messages that reference their specific experience
- **Founder Networking**: Build relationships with fellow entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors
- **Event Follow-up**: Send personalized connection requests to conference attendees and speakers
- **Partnership Development**: Connect with potential partners by referencing their company achievements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: AI generating messages over 300 characters
- **Solution**: Add explicit character count requirement in the system prompt; the current prompt specifies 200-250 characters

**Issue**: "Profile not found" errors from ConnectSafely.ai
- **Solution**: Ensure LinkedIn URLs are complete (include `https://www.linkedin.com/in/`)

**Issue**: Generic-sounding AI messages
- **Solution**: Enhance the system prompt with more specific context about your background and goals

**Issue**: Duplicate connection requests sent
- **Solution**: Verify "Mark as In Progress" node runs before "Fetch LinkedIn Profile"; check that `row_number` column exists in your sheet

**Issue**: Google Sheets not updating
- **Solution**: Confirm `row_number` column exists and the matching column is correctly configured

**Issue**: Bearer Auth errors
- **Solution**: Verify your ConnectSafely.ai API key is valid and has proper permissions
