Campaign tracking is pivotal; it enables marketers to evaluate the efficacy of various strategies and channels. UTM parameters are particularly essential as they provide granular details about the source, medium, and campaign effectiveness. 
However, when this data is not automatically integrated into a centralized system, it can become a tedious and error-prone process to manually collate and analyze it.

Retrieving UTM data from Shopify and storing it in Baserow enables oy to do more with this data. For example you could build a campaign database in Baserow and automatically add campaign revenue to it using this workflow template.

## This template will demonstrate the follwing concepts in n8n:

- split larger incoming datasets into n8n items with the **Split node**
- transform the data structure with the **Set node**
- control flow with the **If node**
- store data in Baserow with the **Baserow node**

## How to get started?

1. Create a custom app in Shopify get the credentials needed to connect n8n to Shopify
This is needed for the Shopify Trigger
2. Create **Shopify Acces Token API** credentials n n8n for the Shopify trigger node
3. Create **Header Auth** credentials: 
Use **X-Shopify-Access-Token** as the name and the Acces-Token from the Shopify App you created as the value.
The Header Auth is neccessary for the GraphQL nodes.
4. You will need a running Baserow instance for this. You can also sign up for a free account at [https://baserow.io/](https://baserow.io/)
