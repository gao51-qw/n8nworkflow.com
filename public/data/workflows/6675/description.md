## How it works
This template helps project managers collect task updates and photo reports from field workers via Telegram and stores everything in a Google Sheet. It enables daily project reporting without paper or back-office overhead.

High-level flow:

Workers receive daily tasks via Telegram

They respond with photo reports

Bot auto-saves replies (photos + status) to a Google Sheet

The system tracks task completion, adds timestamps, and maintains report history

## Set up steps
🕒 Estimated setup time: 15–30 min
You’ll need:

A Telegram bot (via BotFather)

A connected Google Sheet (with specific column headers)

A set of preconfigured tasks

👉 Detailed setup instructions and required table structure are documented in sticky notes inside the workflow.
