This workflow takes Dialpad call information for an answered call and pushes it into Syncro as either a ticket or an update to an existing ticket. You will need to have a workflow for each technician at this time. It also saves call/ticket information to a Google Sheet to be queried by the dialpad_to_syncro_timer.json workflow. This will match to inbound and outbound calls, so if that's not desired you need to add in an IF to only proceed on either inbound or outbound calls.
