## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

This automation creates a complete, hands-free lead nurturing system for real estate agents using SignSnap Home for open house visitor management. Every time someone signs in at your open house, this workflow:

1. **Instantly captures** all visitor data from SignSnap Home via webhook
2. **Intelligently scores** each lead based on agent status and property interest
3. **Automatically syncs** contact information to three CRMs simultaneously:
   - **HubSpot** - For marketing automation and pipeline management
   - **Follow Up Boss** - For real estate-specific lead management
   - **Monday.com** - For team collaboration and task tracking
4. **Logs everything** to Google Sheets for complete audit trail and reporting
5. **Sends personalized follow-ups** over 7 days for qualified leads:
   - **Day 0**: Immediate thank you email
   - **Day 2**: SMS text message check-in
   - **Day 5**: Market update email with consultation offer
   - **Day 7**: Automatic task created in HubSpot for agent to call

## 🔥 Key Features

### Smart Lead Qualification
Not all open house visitors are equal. This workflow automatically identifies **qualified leads** who receive the full follow-up sequence:

✅ Visitors who don't currently have a real estate agent  
✅ Visitors who have an agent but haven't signed a buyer agreement

Leads who already have representation get the basic treatment (thank you email + CRM sync) to respect existing relationships while still capturing their information for future opportunities.

### Multi-CRM Distribution
Why limit yourself to one CRM? This workflow syncs to three platforms simultaneously:

- **HubSpot**: Creates/updates contacts with full lead scoring and property visit history
- **Follow Up Boss**: Adds leads with source attribution and detailed notes
- **Monday.com**: Creates board items for team visibility and collaboration

### Complete Activity Tracking
Every touchpoint is logged to Google Sheets across three tabs:
- **Lead Master Log**: Complete record of every visitor with lead scores and qualification status
- **Follow-up Activity**: Timestamp of every email, SMS, and task created
- **Errors**: Captures any visitors without email addresses for manual follow-up

### TCPA-Compliant SMS Follow-up
Automated SMS messaging via Twilio includes:
- Proper consent tracking (via open house sign-in)
- "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" compliance footer
- Personalized messaging based on agent status
- Complete activity logging for audit trail

---

- **Real Estate Agents** using SignSnap Home for open house management
- **Real Estate Teams** who need centralized lead tracking across multiple CRMs
- **Brokerages** wanting to standardize follow-up processes across agents
