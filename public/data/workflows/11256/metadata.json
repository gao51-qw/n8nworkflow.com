  "description": "## Description\n\nThis workflow continuously validates data quality using rules stored in Notion, runs anomaly checks against your SQL database, generates AI-powered diagnostics, and alerts your team only when real issues occur.\n\nNotion holds all data quality rules (source, field, condition, severity).\nn8n reads them on schedule, converts them into live SQL queries, and aggregates anomalies into a global run summary.\n\nThe workflow then scores data health, creates a Notion run record, optionally opens a Jira issue, and sends a Slack/email alert including AI-generated root cause & recommended fixes.\n\n## Target users\nPerfect for:\n- DataOps\n-  Analytics\n-  Product Data\n-  BI\n-  Compliance\n-  ETL/ELT pipelines\n-  Platform reliability teams.\n\n## Workflow steps\n![image.png](fileId:3462)\n\n## How it works\n1) Notion → Rules Database\n   Each entry defines a check (table, field, condition, severity).\n2) n8n → Dynamic Query Execution\n   Rules are converted into SQL and checked automatically.\n\n3) Summary Engine\n   Aggregates anomalies, computes data quality score.\n\n4) AI Diagnostic Layer\n   Root cause analysis + recommended fix plan.\n\n5) Incident Handling\n   Notion Run Page + optional Slack/Email/Jira escalation.\n   Silent exit when no anomaly = zero noise.\n\n## Setup Instructions \n\n- Create two Notion databases:\n\t- Data Quality Rules → source / field / rule / severity / owner\n\t![image.png](fileId:3460)\n\n\t- Data Quality Runs → run_id / timestamp / score / anomalies / trend / AI summary/recommendation\n![image.png](fileId:3461)\n- Connect SQL database (Postgres / Supabase / Redshift etc.)\n- Add OpenAI credentials for AI analysis\n- Connect Slack + Gmail + Jira for incident alerts\n- Set your execution schedule (daily/weekly)\n\n## Expected outcomes\n\n- Fully automated, rule-based data quality monitoring with minimal maintenance and zero manual checking.\n- When everything is healthy, runs remain silent.\n- When data breaks, the team is notified instantly: with context, root cause insight, and a structured remediation output.\n\n## Tutorial video\n[Watch the Youtube Tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FKUET16dVk)\n\n## About me :\nI’m Yassin a Project & Product Manager  Scaling tech products with data-driven project management.\n📬 Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yassin-zehar)\n",
