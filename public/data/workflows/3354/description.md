Automatically backs up your workflows to Github and generates documentation in a Notion database.

- Weekly run, uses the "internal-infra" tag to look for new or recently modified workflows
- Uses a Notion database page to hold the workflow summary, last updated date, and a link to the workflow
- Uses OpenAI's 4o-mini to generate a summarization of what the workflow does
- Stores a backup of the workflow in GitHub (recommend a private repo)
- Sends notification to Slack channel for new or updated workflows

## Who is this for

- Anyone seeking backup of their most important workflows
- Anyone seeking version control for their most important workflows

- N8N: You will need an N8N credential created so the workflow can query the N8N instance to find all active workflows with the "internal-infra" tag
- Notion: You will need an Notion credential created
- OpenAI: You will need an OpenAI credential, unless you intend on rewiring this with your AI of choice (ollama, openrouter, etc.)
