Who’s it for

Traders, operations teams, and finance-minded founders who want a low-maintenance USD/JPY monitor that blends live pricing with short, news-aware AI commentary—delivered straight to email on a reliable cadence.

How it works / What it does

On a fixed schedule (every 4 hours), the workflow fetches the latest USD→JPY spot rate, enriches it with recent market context via a search tool, and asks an AI agent to produce a concise, structured take (trend, key drivers, and a buy/sell/neutral stance with rationale). The final summary is sent by email so stakeholders can skim, log, or forward without opening n8n. The design favors clarity (renamed nodes, sticky notes) and safety (no hardcoded secrets).

How to set up

Open Set (Fields) — Configure me and enter your Tavily API key and notification email.

In Send results via Gmail, attach your email credential (or swap to SMTP/another provider).

(Optional) Point LLM provider (configure) to your preferred model/vendor.

Enable the schedule or adjust the interval to match your cadence.
