## Description

### Who is this for?
This workflow is perfect for graphic designers, creative agencies, marketing teams, or freelancers who regularly use AI-generated images in their projects. It's specifically beneficial for teams that want to automate the generation, review, and management of AI-created graphics efficiently.

### What problem does this workflow solve?
Design teams often face time-consuming manual reviews and inconsistent quality checks for AI-generated images. This workflow addresses these challenges by automating image generation and introducing a systematic, AI-driven vetting process. This ensures only high-quality, relevant images reach your team's assets, saving valuable time and enhancing workflow efficiency.

### What this workflow does
- **AI Image Generation:** Integrates Ideogram via HTTP Request to automatically create AI-generated images based on creative briefs.
- **Automated Image Review:** Uses OpenAI to automatically evaluate and approve images, ensuring they meet your predefined quality standards.
- **Efficient Asset Management:** Automatically creates structured Google Drive folders and compiles key metadata (including creation dates, prompts, and image links) into a CSV file and Google Sheet.
- **Immediate Email Notifications:** Delivers a setup confirmation and provides easy access to Google Drive folders and assets via automated email notifications.
- **Final Approved Images:** Outputs vetted, ready-to-use images for your creative projects, removing the burden of manual reviews.
