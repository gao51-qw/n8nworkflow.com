## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Telegram Bot Interface:** Interact with your AI assistant using both text and voice commands through Telegram.
*   **AI Voice Bot:**
    *   Transcribes user voice messages using OpenAI Whisper.
    *   Processes requests with an AI agent powered by Google Gemini.
    *   Responds with AI-synthesized voice using Replicate API.
*   **PDF RAG System:**
    *   Index PDF documents from Google Drive via Telegram commands.
    *   Utilizes Mistral AI for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDFs.
    *   Stores document content and embeddings in a Qdrant vector database.
    *   Answers questions about your documents using Google Gemini, based on retrieved context.
*   **Google Suite Automation:**
    *   Manage Google Calendar: Create events, find upcoming holidays, and list birthdays.
    *   Google Drive: Search for PDF files and manage document templates.
    *   Google Docs: Automatically generate invoices from templates.
*   **Intelligent Web Search:** Employs Brave Search for fetching real-time information from the web.
*   **Versatile AI Agent:** Leverages Google Gemini with a suite of tools including a calculator, date & time utilities, and custom integrations (e.g., example Airbnb tools).
*   **Command-Driven Functionality:** Easily trigger specific actions using Telegram commands like `/help`, `/pdf`, `/rag`, `/invoice`, `/chat`, `/brave`, and `/birthday`.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The workflow is initiated by messages or commands sent to your Telegram bot. A central `Switch` node directs the flow based on the input received.

## 1. Telegram Interaction & Command Routing
*   A **Telegram Trigger** node listens for new messages (text or voice).
*   A "typing..." indicator is sent to Telegram for better user experience.
*   The **Switch** node parses the message content and routes it to the appropriate sub-workflow based on predefined commands (e.g., `/pdf`, `/rag`, `/voice`) or general chat.

## 2. AI Voice Bot Functionality
*   For voice messages (or if the voice path is triggered):
    *   The voice file is downloaded from Telegram.
    *   **OpenAI Whisper** transcribes the audio into text.
    *   The transcribed text is fed to an **AI Agent** (powered by Google Gemini and equipped with various tools and memory).
    *   The AI Agent's text response is then sent to the **Replicate API** to generate a natural-sounding voice.
    *   The generated audio response is sent back to the user on Telegram.

## 3. PDF RAG System with Mistral OCR & Qdrant
*   **Indexing PDFs (via `/qdrant &lt;Google_Drive_File_ID&gt;` command):**
    *   The specified PDF is downloaded from Google Drive.
    *   The PDF is uploaded to **Mistral AI** for OCR processing.
    *   The extracted text (in markdown format) is retrieved.
    *   The text is split into manageable chunks.
    *   **OpenAI Embeddings** are generated for each chunk.
    *   These chunks and their embeddings are stored in a **Qdrant** vector collection.
    *   A confirmation message is sent to Telegram.
*   **Querying PDFs (via `/rag &lt;your_question&gt;` command):**
    *   The user's question is processed by a **RetrievalQA Chain**.
    *   This chain uses Google Gemini as the Language Model and retrieves relevant document chunks from Qdrant based on semantic similarity (embeddings).
    *   Google Gemini then generates a concise answer based on the user's question and the retrieved contextual information from the documents.
    *   The answer is sent back to the user on Telegram.
*   **Searching PDFs in Drive (via `/pdf &lt;search_term&gt;` command):**
    *   Searches your Google Drive for PDF files matching the provided search term.
    *   Sends a list of found PDF files (name and ID) to the user on Telegram, allowing them to easily identify files for indexing with `/qdrant`.

## 4. AI Chat & Task Automation (General Chat & `/chat` command)
*   Handles general text messages or transcribed voice inputs that are not specific commands.
*   An **AI Agent** (Google Gemini) processes these inputs.
*   The agent is equipped with tools such as:
    *   **Google Calendar Tools:** To create events, find the next public holiday, or list upcoming birthdays.
    *   **Brave Search Tool:** To search the internet for information.
    *   **Calculator Tool:** For mathematical computations.
    *   **Date & Time Utility:** For handling and formatting dates.
    *   **Example Airbnb Tools:** Demonstrates extensibility for custom tool integrations.
*   The agent utilizes a "Think Node" process for reasoning and **Window Buffer Memory** to maintain conversational context.
*   Responses are formulated and sent back to the user on Telegram.

## 5. Google Automations
*   **Invoice Generation (via `/invoice` command):**
    *   Copies a predefined Google Docs invoice template from your Google Drive.
    *   Populates the new document with details (client name, items, etc. – currently uses placeholder data from an 'Edit Fields' node, which can be customized to parse input from the command).
    *   Converts the populated Google Doc into a PDF file.
    *   Sends the generated PDF invoice to the user via Telegram.
*   **Calendar Management (via AI Agent or specific commands like `/birthday`):**
    *   The `/birthday` command fetches upcoming birthdays from a specified Google Calendar.
    *   The AI Agent can also interact with Google Calendar to create events or retrieve information based on natural language requests.

## 6. Web Search (via `/brave &lt;query&gt;` command or AI Agent)
*   Performs a web search using the Brave Search API.
*   Returns a list of search results, including titles and URLs, to the user on Telegram.

## 7. Help Command (`/help`)
*   Provides the user with a formatted list of all available Telegram commands and their basic usage instructions.

## 💡 Customization & Learning
This "Beginner Bundle" is not just a ready-to-use solution but also a fantastic learning resource:

*   **Explore AI Agent Prompts:** Dive into the `AI Agent` nodes to see how prompts are structured to guide the LLM's behavior, including the "Think Node" process and character guidance for robust messaging.
*   **Modify Toolsets:** Easily add or remove tools for the AI agent to expand its capabilities.
*   **Invoice Customization:** Adapt the `Edit Fields` node and the Google Docs template to match your invoicing needs. You can extend it to parse invoice details directly from the Telegram command.
*   **RAG Parameters:** Experiment with chunk sizes, overlap, and different embedding models in the RAG pipeline.
*   **Extend Commands:** Add new commands and corresponding functionalities by expanding the main `Switch` node and building out new automation paths.
