## 📌 Overview

**Description:**

This powerful workflow automates your sales quotation process by connecting Pipedrive with DottedSign. When a deal is moved to a specific stage in Pipedrive, this template automatically generates a professional PDF quotation, uploads it back to the deal, and sends it out for e-signature via DottedSign service, saving your sales team valuable time and eliminating manual work.

## What it does

When a Pipedrive deal moves to a designated stage (e.g., "Quotation Stage"), this workflow triggers and performs the following actions:
1.  **Gathers Data:** It collects all relevant information, including deal details, client contacts, organization info, and associated products from Pipedrive.
2.  **Generates PDF Quote:** It populates a customizable HTML template with the collected data and uses a PDF generation service (Gotenberg) to create a polished PDF document.
3.  **Uploads to Pipedrive:** The generated PDF quote is automatically uploaded to the "Files" section of the corresponding Pipedrive deal for record-keeping.
4.  **Sends for E-Signature:** It creates a new signing task in DottedSign, sending the quotation to the client for their electronic signature.

## Requirements

-   A Pipedrive account with admin permissions.
-   A DottedSign developer account to obtain API credentials.
-   A self-hosted instance of [Gotenberg](https://gotenberg.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) for HTML to PDF conversion.

## How to set up

1.  **Pipedrive Trigger Stage:** In the `If` node, change the stage ID `7` to the ID of the pipeline stage you want to use as the trigger.
2.  **PDF Conversion Service:** In the `Gotenberg to PDF` (HTTP Request) node, replace the placeholder URL with the endpoint of your running Gotenberg instance.
3.  **DottedSign Credentials:** In the `Get DottedSign Access Token` node, enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` in the request body.
4.  **DottedSign Signature Field:** In the `Create DottedSign Task` node, you **must** adjust the `page` and `coord` values under `field_settings` to match the desired signature location on your PDF template.

## How to customize the workflow

-   **Quotation Template:** Edit the `Generate Quotation HTML` node to modify the quote's appearance, text, company logo, and terms. The `{{ ... }}` expressions are placeholders that are filled with Pipedrive data.
-   **Trigger:** Replace the Pipedrive Trigger with another trigger, such as a webhook or a form submission, to adapt the workflow to different needs.
-   **Notifications:** Add a Slack or email node at the end of the workflow to notify the sales team once the quotation has been sent.
