  "description": "## 🛡️ Evaluate Guardrails Node Accuracy with Automated Test Suite\n\nThis workflow benchmarks the **n8n Guardrails node** across multiple safety categories -including PII, NSFW, jailbreak attempts, secret keys, and unsafe URLs.  \nIt runs **36 structured test cases**, classifies each as PASS or VIOLATION, calculates accuracy metrics, and emails a detailed HTML report.\n\n\n### 🔄 How it works\n1. The workflow loops through 36 predefined test prompts.  \n2. Each prompt is checked by the **Guardrails node** for violations.  \n3. Results are recorded as PASS or VIOLATION.  \n4. The system calculates metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).  \n5. A formatted Markdown → HTML report is generated and sent via Gmail.\n\n### ⚙️ Set up steps\n1. Add your **OpenAI** and **Gmail** credentials in n8n.  \n2. Replace `YOUR_MAIL_HERE` in the Gmail node with your own address.  \n3. *(Optional)* Change the model in the **OpenAI Chat Model** node.  \n   - Default: `gpt-4o-mini`  \n   - You can switch to `gpt-5` or another available model if needed.  \n4. Click **Execute Workflow**: test cases will run automatically.  \n5. Check your inbox for the results.\n\n### 🧠 Who it’s for\n- AI safety testers and workflow developers  \n- n8n users experimenting with the Guardrails node  \n- Teams validating LLM moderation, filtering, or compliance setups\n\n### 🧩 Requirements\n- n8n **v1.119+**  \n- Guardrails node enabled  \n- OpenAI credentials (optional but recommended)  \n- Email integration (Gmail or SendGrid)\n\n\n## 💡 Why it’s useful\nUse this test suite to understand how accurately the Guardrails node identifies unsafe content across different categories. The generated metrics help you fine-tune thresholds, compare models, and strengthen AI moderation workflows.\n\n### Example result\n![image.png](fileId:3279)\n![image.png](fileId:3280)",
