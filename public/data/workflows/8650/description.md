This workflow integrates [HetrixTools](https://hetrixtools.com/) with WhatsApp via the GOWA API to automate notifications about server monitoring events. It distinguishes between **Uptime Monitoring** and **Resource Usage Monitoring** events, formats the message accordingly, and sends it to a WhatsApp number using the GOWA WhatsApp REST API.

It's especially useful for DevOps, sysadmins, or teams who need real-time server alerts delivered via WhatsApp.

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

1. **Set up HetrixTools:**

   * Make sure to select this contact in your monitor’s alert settings.

2. **Configure n8n Webhook:**
