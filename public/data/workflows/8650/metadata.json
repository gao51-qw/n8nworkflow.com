  "description": "This workflow integrates [HetrixTools](https://hetrixtools.com/) with WhatsApp via the GOWA API to automate notifications about server monitoring events. It distinguishes between **Uptime Monitoring** and **Resource Usage Monitoring** events, formats the message accordingly, and sends it to a WhatsApp number using the GOWA WhatsApp REST API.\n\nIt's especially useful for DevOps, sysadmins, or teams who need real-time server alerts delivered via WhatsApp.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**\n\n1. **Set up HetrixTools:**\n\n   * Create a HetrixTools account at [https://hetrixtools.com/register](https://hetrixtools.com/register)\n   * Create your **Uptime Monitors** and/or enable **Resource Usage Monitoring** for your servers.\n   * Go to your HetrixTools contact settings and add the **n8n Webhook URL** provided by the workflow.\n   * Make sure to select this contact in your monitor’s alert settings.\n\n2. **Configure n8n Webhook:**\n\n   * Set the Webhook node to HTTP method: `POST`\n   * Ensure it is accessible via a public URL (you can use n8n Cloud, reverse proxy, or tunnel like `ngrok` for testing).\n\n3. **Customize WhatsApp Message:**\n\n   * The workflow includes a conditional branch to check whether the event is a Resource Usage alert or an Uptime alert.\n   * Each branch contains editable text nodes for customizing the WhatsApp message content.\n\n4. **Set up GOWA WhatsApp API:**\n\n   * Make sure your GOWA instance is running and accessible.\n   * Create necessary credentials (API key, base URL, etc.).\n   * In n8n, add the credentials and fill in the **sendChatPresence** and **sendText** nodes accordingly.\n\n5. **Deploy the Workflow:**\n\n   * Save and activate the workflow.\n   * Trigger a test alert from HetrixTools to verify if messages are received on WhatsApp.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 **Prerequisites**\n\n* An active [HetrixTools](https://hetrixtools.com/) account with Uptime Monitors or Resource Usage Monitoring enabled.\n* A publicly accessible instance of **n8n** with Webhook node enabled.\n* Access to a running and configured **GOWA** (WhatsApp REST API) server.\n* Required credentials configured in n8n for GOWA (API key, URL, phone number, etc.).\n\n---",
