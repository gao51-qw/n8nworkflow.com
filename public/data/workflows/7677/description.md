## Generate AI Images & Videos with KIE.AI Midjourney API
### Overview
Generate high-quality AI images and videos using KIE.AI's Midjourney API through an intuitive form interface. This n8n workflow supports three distinct content creation modes, delivering professional results with automated processing and real-time progress monitoring.
**Supported Modes:**
- **Text-to-Image** (`mj_txt2img`): Generate original images from written descriptions
- **Image-to-Image** (`mj_img2img`): Transform or enhance existing images with AI
- **Image-to-Video** (`mj_video`): Animate still images into short video clips
Users interact only through a simple form interface, requiring no coding skills. After submitting a request, the system automatically calls the KIE.AI API, monitors progress in real-time, and retrieves the final output once ready.
