  "description": "## Generate AI Images & Videos with KIE.AI Midjourney API\n### Overview\nGenerate high-quality AI images and videos using KIE.AI's Midjourney API through an intuitive form interface. This n8n workflow supports three distinct content creation modes, delivering professional results with automated processing and real-time progress monitoring.\n**Supported Modes:**\n- **Text-to-Image** (`mj_txt2img`): Generate original images from written descriptions\n- **Image-to-Image** (`mj_img2img`): Transform or enhance existing images with AI\n- **Image-to-Video** (`mj_video`): Animate still images into short video clips\nUsers interact only through a simple form interface, requiring no coding skills. After submitting a request, the system automatically calls the KIE.AI API, monitors progress in real-time, and retrieves the final output once ready.\n### Perfect for\nContent creators, designers, marketers, and developers who need to quickly generate diverse AI visual content with automated processing and professional quality results.\n### Prerequisites\n- **KIE.AI Account**: Sign up at [KIE.AI](https://kie.ai) to obtain your free or paid API key.\n- **n8n Instance**: Active n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted) with HTTP Request and form submission capabilities.\n- **AI Prompt Knowledge**: Basic understanding of AI prompts for optimal generation results.\n- **Reference Images** (Optional): Publicly accessible image URLs for image-to-image or image-to-video generation.\n### Quick Setup\n#### 1. **Get API Key**\nRegister at [KIE.AI](https://kie.ai) and generate your API key. Store it securely and never share it publicly.\n#### 2. **Configure Form Fields**\nSet up these fields in your \"On Form Submission\" node:\n- **`tasktype`** (Required): Select generation mode\n  - `mj_txt2img` for text-to-image generation\n  - `mj_img2img` for image-to-image generation  \n  - `mj_video` for image-to-video generation\n- **`prompt`** (Required): Text description for your content generation\n- **`imgurl`** (Optional): Image URL array for image-to-image or image-to-video generation\n  - **Important**: Leave empty for text-to-image generation (`mj_txt2img`)\n- **`api_key`** (Required): Your KIE.AI API key for authentication\n#### 3. **Test & Use**\n1. Click \"Execute Workflow\" in n8n.\n2. Access the generated form URL.\n3. Fill in your details and submit.\n4. Wait for processing (workflow polls every 10 seconds).\n5.
