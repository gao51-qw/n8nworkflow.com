The **bykhaisa** workflow streamlines makeup service bookings by capturing customer details via webhook, calculating pricing including add-ons and payment types, generating payment invoices with Xendit, and sending personalized WhatsApp booking confirmations.

This powerful combination of n8n, GoWhatsApp API, and Xendit reduces manual work and accelerates payment collection, saving you valuable time and boosting client satisfaction.
