  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* **HR professionals** and **recruiters** who want to automate and enhance the hiring process\n* **Organizations** seeking AI-driven, consistent, and data-backed candidate evaluations\n* **Hiring managers** using Airtable as their recruitment database\n\n---\n\n## **What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\nScreening candidates manually is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. This workflow solves that by:\n\n* **Automating resume intake and AI evaluation**\n* **Matching candidates to job postings dynamically**\n* **Generating standardized suitability reports**\n* **Notifying HR only when candidates meet the criteria**\n* **Storing all applications in a structured Airtable database**\n\n---\n\n## **What this workflow does**\n\nThis workflow builds an end-to-end AI-powered hiring pipeline using Airtable, OpenAI, and Google Drive. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Accept candidate applications** via a public web form, including resume upload (PDF only)\n2. **Extract text from uploaded resumes** for processing\n3. **Store resumes** in Google Drive and generate shareable links\n4. **Match the application** to a job posting stored in Airtable\n5. **Use AI to evaluate candidates** (via OpenAI GPT-4) against job descriptions and requirements\n6. **Generate suitability results** including:\n\n   * Match percentage\n   * Screening status: Suitable, Not Suitable, Under Review\n   * Detailed notes\n7. **Combine AI output and files** into one data object\n8. **Create a new candidate record** in Airtable with all application data\n9. **Automatically notify HR** via Gmail if a candidate is marked “Suitable”\n\n---\n\n## **Setup**\n\n1. **View & Copy the Airtable base** here:  \n👉 [Candidate Screening – Airtable Base Template](https://airtable.com/appgVjZcaRP8BsKf0/shrQAqQ2JUW50EEyW)  \n2. **Set up Google Drive folder**\n3. **Connect your OpenAI API key** for the AI agent model\n4. **Connect your Gmail account** for email notifications\n5. **Deploy the public-facing form** to start receiving applications\n6. **Test the workflow** using a sample job and resume\n\n---\n\n## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n* **Expand file support**: Allow DOC or DOCX uploads by adding format conversion nodes\n* **Add multi-recipient email alerts**: Extend Gmail node for multiple HR recipients\n* **Handle “Under Review” differently**: Add additional logic to notify or flag these candidates\n* **Send rejection emails automatically**: Extend the IF branch for “Not Suitable” candidates\n* **Schedule interviews**: Integrate with Google Calendar or Calendly APIs\n* **Add Slack notifications**: Send alerts to team channels for real-time updates\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**",
