## **Who is this for?**

This workflow is ideal for:

* **Organizations** seeking AI-driven, consistent, and data-backed candidate evaluations
* **Hiring managers** using Airtable as their recruitment database

## **What problem is this workflow solving?**

Screening candidates manually is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. This workflow solves that by:

* **Automating resume intake and AI evaluation**
* **Matching candidates to job postings dynamically**
* **Generating standardized suitability reports**
* **Notifying HR only when candidates meet the criteria**
* **Storing all applications in a structured Airtable database**

## **What this workflow does**

This workflow builds an end-to-end AI-powered hiring pipeline using Airtable, OpenAI, and Google Drive. Here's how it works:

1. **Accept candidate applications** via a public web form, including resume upload (PDF only)
2. **Extract text from uploaded resumes** for processing
3. **Store resumes** in Google Drive and generate shareable links
4. **Match the application** to a job posting stored in Airtable
5. **Use AI to evaluate candidates** (via OpenAI GPT-4) against job descriptions and requirements
6. **Generate suitability results** including:

   * Match percentage
   * Screening status: Suitable, Not Suitable, Under Review
   * Detailed notes
7. **Combine AI output and files** into one data object
8. **Create a new candidate record** in Airtable with all application data
9. **Automatically notify HR** via Gmail if a candidate is marked “Suitable”
