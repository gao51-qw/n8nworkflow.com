  "description": "### **How It Works**\n\nThis template is an **n8n workflow that integrates with Jira to provide automated replies**.  \n\nWhen a ticket is assigned to a user, the workflow analyzes the ticket content, retrieves relevant knowledge from a vector database, and generates a response.  \nBy continuously enriching the knowledge base, the system improves response quality in Jira.  \n\n---\n\n### **Prerequisites**\n\n- A Jira account with API access  \n- A Pinecone account and credentials (API key and environment settings)  \n- An AI provider credential (e.g., OpenAI API key)  \n\n---\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n1. **Jira Credentials**  \n   - Create Jira credentials in n8n (API token and email).  \n   - In the Jira node, **select the registered Jira account ID**.  \n\n2. **Vector Database Setup (Pinecone)**  \n   - Register your **Pinecone credentials (API key and environment variables)** in n8n.  \n   - Ensure that your knowledge base is indexed in Pinecone.  \n\n3. **AI Assistant Node**  \n   - Configure the OpenAI (or other LLM) node with your API key.  \n   - Provide a system prompt that explains how to respond to Jira tickets using retrieved knowledge.  \n\n4. **Workflow Execution**  \n   - The workflow runs **only via the Scheduled Trigger node** at defined intervals.  \n   - When Jira tickets are assigned, their summary, description, and latest comments are retrieved.  \n   - These details are passed to the AI assistant, which queries Pinecone and generates a response.  \n   - The generated response is then posted as a Jira comment.  \n\n---\n\n### **Step by Step**\n\n1. **Scheduled Trigger**  \n   The workflow is executed at regular intervals using the Scheduled Trigger node.  \n\n2. **Jira Trigger (Issue Assigned)**  \n   Retrieves the summary, description, and latest comments of assigned tickets.  \n\n3. **AI Assistant**  \n   Sends ticket details to the AI assistant, which searches and summarizes relevant knowledge from Pinecone.  \n\n4. **Response Generation / Ticket Update**  \n   The AI generates a response and automatically posts it as a Jira comment.  \n   (Optionally, the workflow can update the ticket status or mention the assignee.)  \n\n---\n\n### **Notes**\n\n- Keep your Pinecone knowledge base updated to improve accuracy.  \n- You can customize the AI assistant’s behavior by adjusting the system prompt.  \n- Configure the Scheduled Trigger frequency carefully to avoid API rate limits.  \n\n---\n\n### **Further Reference**\nFor a detailed walkthrough (in Japanese), see this article:  \n👉 [Automating Jira responses with n8n, AI, and Pinecone (Qiita)](https://qiita.com/yusan25c/items/f6b15aef451556f4c9fe) \n\nYou can find the template file on GitHub here:  \n👉 [Template File on GitHub](https://github.com/yusan25c/n8n-jira-knowledge-sync-template/tree/main/01_Jira_Knowledge-Sync-Minimal-Summary-Comment-Assignee)",
