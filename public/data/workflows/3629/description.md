## Who is this for?

This workflow is ideal for:

- Individuals seeking to automate personal and professional tasks.
- Professionals needing efficient management of emails, calendars, and contacts.
- Content creators or researchers requiring quick information retrieval and drafting capabilities.
- Anyone wanting a centralized AI assistant.

## What problem is this workflow solving?

Managing numerous digital tasks across different platforms can be time-consuming and fragmented. This workflow consolidates control into Telegram, leveraging AI to understand your needs and automate actions across email, calendar, contacts, web search, note-taking (Notion), social media (X), and your personal knowledge base (Pinecone RAG), saving you time and effort. It ensures tasks are handled correctly using a built-in verification step.

## What this workflow does:

This workflow acts as a central AI Agent that:

1. **Receives Input via Telegram:** Accepts text messages, voice notes (transcribes them using OpenAI), or images (analyzes them using OpenAI).
2. **Understands Requests:** Uses an AI Agent (powered by models like GPT) to interpret the user's instructions.
3. **Orchestrates Tools:** Selects and uses the appropriate tools based on the request:
    - **Email (Gmail):** Send, read, reply, draft, and label emails.
    - **Calendar (Google Calendar):** Create, get, update, and delete events, managing attendees if needed.
    - **Contacts (Google Sheets):** Look up and add contact information.
    - **Web Search (Tavily):** Search the internet for up-to-date information.
    - **Knowledge Retrieval (Pinecone):** Query your personal vector database (RAG).
    - **Note Taking (Notion):** Create notes in a specified Notion database.
    - **Social Media (X/Twitter):** Post tweets directly to X.
4. **Maintains Context:** Uses Window Buffer Memory to remember recent interactions.
5. **Ensures Accuracy:** Employs a "Think" tool to double-check tool usage and task completion.
6. **Responds via Telegram:** Sends the results or confirmation back to the user in the Telegram chat.

## Setup:

1. **Telegram:** Connect your Telegram bot credentials.
2. **AI Model:** Connect your OpenAI API key.
3. **Email:** Connect your Gmail account.
4. **Calendar:** Connect your Google Calendar account.
5. **Contacts:** Connect your Google Sheets account.
6. **Knowledge Base (RAG):** Connect Pinecone.
7. **Note Taking:** Connect Notion and configure Notion Database.
8. **Web Search:** Add Tavily API key.
9. **Social Media:** Connect your X (Twitter) account.
