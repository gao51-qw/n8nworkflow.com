  "title": "Nightly n8n backup to Google Drive",
  "description": "## Description\n\nThis template creates a nightly backup of all n8n workflows and saves them to a Google Drive folder. Each night, the previous night's backups are moved to an “n8n_old” folder and renamed with the corresponding date.\n\nBackups older than a specified age are automatically deleted using a precise code-based verification (this feature is active for 30 days by default, but is fully configurable).\n\n## What's New in v5\n\n* **Modernized Loops:** Replaced the legacy \"Split In Batches\" node with the newer and more efficient **\"Loop Over Items\"** node.\n* **Smart Purge Logic:** Now uses a **Code node** with Javascript (`you can delete`) to accurately calculate file age before deletion, ensuring only files strictly older than 30 days are removed.\n* **Safety Checks:** Implemented logic to verify if the \"n8n_old\" folder exists before attempting any purge operations to prevent errors.\n* **Auto-Healing:** The system now automatically creates the `n8n_backups` and `n8n_old` folders if they are missing.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* **Google Drive account and credentials:** **Get** from the following link. [Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/)\n* **n8n version:** Recommended v1.70.1 up to v2.1.4 or higher (Required for \"Loop Over Items\" compatibility).\n* **n8n API Key:** **Guide** from the following link. [Link](https://witmovil.com/where-to-create-the-api-key-in-n8n/) (Required for the \"Get many workflows\" node).\n* **Destination folders** (Optional, as the script can now create them, but good to have):\n* “n8n_old”\n* “n8n_backups”\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. **Google Drive:** Update all Google Drive nodes with your OAuth2 credentials.\n2. **n8n Connection:** Open the \"Get many workflows\" node (formerly just \"n8n\") and select your **n8n account** credential (API Key).\n3. **Schedule:** Edit the Schedule Trigger node with the desired time to run the backup.\n\n**If you want to configure the auto-purge (delete old backups):**\n\n1. The deletion logic is now handled in the **\"you can delete\"** Code node. You can edit the variable `const THIRTY_DAYS_IN_MS` in the code if you wish to change the 30-day limit.\n2. Enable the “PURGE DAYS” trigger and the subsequent nodes to activate this feature.\n3. Enable the workflow to run on the specified schedule.\n\n## Last updated\n\nDecember 2025\n",
