# Automate job searching & resume customization with AI, LinkedIn & Google Sheets

> # 🤖 AI-Powered Job Matcher & Resume Customizer

## Description

This advanced workflow automates the entire job search and preparation process, moving beyond simple notifications to provide **AI-driven career intelligence**.

It connects to LinkedIn to scrape fresh job postings, filters against jobs you've already seen, and then uses powerful LLMs (Mistral Large/Small) to perform a detailed resume-to-job match, generate tailored cover letters, and provide concrete resume improvement suggestions. All data is logged into a Google Sheet for comprehensive tracking, and a clean, single **Daily Digest Email** summarizes the top 5 matches found each day.

    * **Actionable Resume Improvement** points (e.g., `[ADD]`, `[QUANTIFY]`) to optimize your resume for the specific role.
