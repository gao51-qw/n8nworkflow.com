This workflow transforms any video you drop into a Google Drive folder into a ready-to-publish YouTube upload. It analyzes the video with AI to craft 3 high-CTR title ideas, 3 long SEO-friendly descriptions (with timestamps), and 10–15 optimized tags. It then generates 4 thumbnail options using your face and lets you pick your favorite before auto-publishing to YouTube via Upload-Post.
