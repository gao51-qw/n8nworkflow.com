🤖📞 This workflow automates the process of calling customers to **remind them of their booking reservations** using AI-generated messages and a **Twilio** phone number. It can easily be adapted for other venues.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Trigger**:  
   - The workflow can be triggered **manually** (via *"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’*) or **automatically** at 11 AM daily (via *Schedule Trigger*).  
2. **Data Fetch**:  
   - Retrieves today’s reservations from a **Google Sheet**, filtering rows where `DATE = today` and `CALLED` is empty.  
3. **AI-Generated Call Script**:  
   - For each reservation, the *Secretary Agent* (powered by **OpenRouter’s Grok-4**) generates a **phone script** using the guest’s name, time, and party size.  
4. **Twilio Call**:  
   - The script is sent to **Twilio**, which calls the guest’s phone number (from the sheet) and reads the message aloud using text-to-speech.  
5. **Update & Loop**:  
   - Marks the reservation as called (`CALLED = "x"`) in the sheet and waits **2 minutes** between calls to avoid rate limits.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Twilio Configuration**:  
   - Sign up for Twilio, buy a phone number, and:  
     - Enable **text-to-speech** (set language to Italian).  
     - Configure **geo permissions** for the target country.  
     - Add credentials to the *Twilio node* (sender number in `From` field).  
2. **Google Sheets Setup**:  
   - Clone the Google Sheet template and ensure:  
     - Phone numbers include the **international prefix (without "+")**.  
     - Columns: `DATE`, `TIME`, `NAME`, `N. PEOPLE`, `PHONE`, `CALLED`.  
3. **OpenRouter API**:  
   - Connect the *OpenRouter Chat Model* node to your account (using Grok-4 or another model).  
4. **Deploy**:  
   - Activate the workflow and test with manual execution.  

**Note**: The workflow is currently **inactive** (`active: false`). Enable it after setup.
