  "description": "**How it works (high-level)**\n\nThis workflow automatically triages new tasks created in Todoist in the last 5 minutes.\nIt improves the task description, assigns a priority (P1–P4), and sets a realistic due date based on your current workload.\n\n**Main flow steps**\n\n- Schedule Trigger — runs at a chosen interval.\n- Get many tasks (Todoist) — fetches all tasks created in the last 5 minutes.\n- AI Agent (LLM) — receives the new task plus clear rules to:\n- Rewrite the task description in an imperative style.\n- Score and set the priority (1–4) using Impact × Urgency × Risk.\n- Schedule a due date that respects workload and avoids overbooking.\n- get_open_tasks — provides the agent with the full list of open tasks to check daily capacity.\n- update_task — applies the improved description, chosen priority, and due date back into Todoist.\n\n**Setup steps**\nTime required: ~5-10 minutes.\n- Configure Todoist credentials (API token) and OpenAI credentials in the respective nodes.\n- Adjust the Schedule Trigger to how often you want the system to check for new tasks.\n- Optionally, fine-tune the scoring and scheduling rules inside the AI Agent system prompt.\n\nℹ️ More detailed instructions, reasoning frameworks, and constraints are already included as sticky notes inside the workflow itself.",
