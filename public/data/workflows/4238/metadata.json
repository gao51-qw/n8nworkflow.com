  "description": "Never forget to send a satisfaction survey again! This workflow helps you automatically send CSAT surveys when a Freshdesk ticket is marked “Resolved” – and logs every response in Google Sheets for easy analysis, reporting, and escalation workflows.\n## 💡 Built for CS and ops teams who care about real feedback\nThis template is perfect for:\n- Customer Support Teams who want timely, consistent survey delivery after every resolved ticket.\n- Ops Leads & Admins tired of managing spreadsheets and survey tools manually.\n- Businesses using Freshdesk looking for a no-code feedback loop.\n- Automation fans who want to track, trigger, and take action — automatically.\n\n\n## 🧩 What problem does it solve?\nManual survey processes are slow, inconsistent, and hard to scale. This automation ensures:\n- Fast survey delivery when experiences are still fresh.\n- No duplicate emails thanks to a built-in tracking system.\n- Centralized feedback in a Google Sheet — no more digging through platforms.\n- Data you can act on, like triggering Slack alerts for poor scores.\n\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n### 📨 Part 1: Auto-send the survey when a ticket is resolved\n1. Trigger: Workflow runs on a schedule (or manually via “Test”).\n2. Pull ticket status from Freshdesk.\n3. Compare ticket status to the last known status in Google Sheets.\n4. Detect resolution: If status = “Resolved” (ID 4), move forward.\n5. Update the Google Sheet to track that the survey was sent.\n6. Fetch the customer’s email from Freshdesk.\n7. Create & send the survey email, personalized with ticket info and your brand.\n8. Convert Markdown → HTML for a well-formatted email.\n\n### 📥 Part 2: Collect responses and store in Sheets\n1. Form Trigger: Customer clicks the survey link and fills in the form.\n2. Capture responses (e.g. rating + comments).\n3. Log feedback in a second Google Sheet for analysis.\n\n\nYou can extend this by adding escalation steps (e.g. flagging 1–2 star ratings to managers).\n\n## 🚀 Setup Instructions\n### 🔐 Connect your tools\n- **Freshdesk**: Add your API credentials to the get tickets and get client nodes.\n- **Google Sheets**: Authenticate in the get existing tickets, update status, and save survey nodes.\n- **Email (SMTP)**: Add your SMTP details in the “Send Email” node, or swap in Gmail, SendGrid, etc.\n\n\n### 🛠 Set your data\n- In the Set your data node, enter:\n\t- Your name, email, company, and position\n\t- Your survey form link (see below)\n\n\n### 🔗 Get the form link\n- Activate the workflow (toggle it ON)\n- Go to the “Survey” (Form Trigger) node\n- Copy the Production URL\n- Paste it into the survey link field in the Set your data node\n\n\n### 🧾 Prepare your Google Sheets\n#### Sheet 1: Freshdesk Tickets (status tracking)\nUsed by:\n- get existing tickets\n- update status\n\n\nCreate a new empty Google Sheet.\n\nAdd the Spreadsheet ID + Sheet Name into the nodes.\n\n#### Sheet 2: Feedback freshdesk (survey responses)\nUsed by:\n- save survey to google sheet\n\nCreate a new sheet or tab. It will auto-create columns based on your survey form field labels.\n\nAdd the Spreadsheet ID + Sheet Name/GID to the save node.\n\n## 🔧 Customize the workflow\n### 📝 Survey Questions\n- Modify them in the Survey (Form Trigger) node.\n- Adjust the save survey to google sheet node as needed (or use auto-map).\n### 💬 Email Content\n- Edit the subject and message in the Create the email text (Set) node.\n\n\n### 🏷 Freshdesk Status ID\n- If your “Resolved” status ID isn’t 4, update the second condition in the If ticket resolved node.\n\n\n### 📉 Escalate poor feedback\nAdd logic after the save survey to google sheet node:\n- If rating is low:\n\t- Notify Slack\n\t- Create a new internal ticket\n\t- Email a team lead\n\n\n### 🔁 Schedule Trigger\nAdjust the Schedule Trigger node to your desired interval (e.g., hourly).\n### 🔄 Use a Webhook Instead (Optional)\nIf Freshdesk supports ticket webhook events, swap the schedule trigger for a Webhook Trigger node to send surveys instantly on ticket resolution.\n\n## 🤖 Why Pollup AI is building this\nAt **Pollup AI**, we help CS and support teams stop drowning in tools and manual tasks.
