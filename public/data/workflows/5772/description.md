# Trump-o-meter: Extract and Evaluate Truth Social Posts

## Use Case

Automatically extracting posts from Donald Trump's Truth Social account and estimating their potential impact on the U.S. stock market enables teams to monitor high-profile communications that may influence financial markets.

4. Splits the results into individual post items.
