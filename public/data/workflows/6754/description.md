# 🔍 AI-Powered Website Prompt Executor (Apify + OpenRouter)

This workflow combines the power of [Apify](https://apify.com) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) to **scrape website content** and **execute any custom prompt** using AI. You define what you want — whether it’s extracting contact details, summarizing content, collecting job offers, or anything else — and the system intelligently processes the site to give you results.

## 🚀 Overview

This workflow allows you to:
1. Input a URL and define a prompt.
2. Scrape the specified number of pages from the website.
3. Process each page’s metadata and Markdown content.
4. Use AI to interpret and respond to the prompt on each page.
5. Aggregate and return structured output.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Input Example

```json
{
  "enqueue": true,
  "maxPages": 5,
  "url": "https://apify.com",
  "method": "GET",
  "prompt": "collect all contact informations available on this website"
}
````

| 1    | Triggered by another workflow with JSON input.                                                                                                                                 |
| 2    | Calls the Apify actor [`firescraper-ai-website-content-markdown-scraper`](https://apify.com/mohamedgb00714/firescraper-ai-website-content-markdown-scraper) to scrape content. |
| 3    | Loops through the scraped pages.                                                                                                                                               |
| 4    | AI analyzes each page based on the input prompt.                                                                                                                               |
| 5    | Aggregates AI outputs across all pages.                                                                                                                                        |
| 6    | Final AI processing step to return a clean structured result.                                                                                                                  |
