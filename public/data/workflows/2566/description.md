This n8n template combines an AI agent with n8n's multi-page forms to create a novel interaction which allows automated question-and-answer sessions. One of the more obvious use-cases of this interaction is what I'm calling the AI interviewer.

## How it works

* A form trigger is used to start the interview and a new session is created in redis to capture the transcript.
* An AI agent is then tasked to ask questions to the user regarding the topic of the interview. This is setup as a loop so the questions never stop unless the user wishes to end the interview.
* Each answer is recorded in our session set up earlier between questions.
* When the user requests to end the interview we break the loop and show the interview completion screen.
* Finally, the session is then saved in a Google Sheet which can then be shared with team members and for the purpose of data analysis.

## How to use

* You'll need to be on a n8n instance that is accessible to your target audience. **Not technical enough to setup your own server? [Try out n8n cloud](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/ee7izbliiw0n) and instantly deploy template!**
* Remember to activate the workflow so the form trigger is published and available for users to use.

## Requirements
* Groq LLM for AI agent. Feel free to swap this out for any other LLM.
* Redis(-compatible) storage for capturing sessions

## Customising this workflow

* The next step would be adding tools! AI interviews with knowledge retrieval could definitely open up other possibilities. Eg. An onboarding wizard generating questions by pulling facts from internal knowledgebase.
