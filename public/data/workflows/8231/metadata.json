  "description": "Capture new Jotform submissions and instantly create items on a Monday.com board with mapped columns (email, date, dropdowns, instructions, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup — Jotform (simple)\n1. **Add your Jotform API key** (Jotform Account → Settings → API → Create Key).  \n2. **Create your form template** in Jotform (use fields like Name, Email, Start Date, Engagement Type, Campaign Type, Instructions).  \n3. In **n8n**, open the **Jotform Trigger** node and **choose your Jotform template/form** from the dropdown. That’s it.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup — Monday.com\n1. In Monday.com, **generate an API token** (Admin/Developers → API).  \n2. In **n8n → Credentials → New → Monday.com**, paste your **API token**.  \n3. Identify and set:\n   - **Board ID** (from your board URL or via node “List” operations)  \n   - **Group ID** (e.g., `topics`)  \n   - **Column IDs** that match your board (examples used by this workflow):  \n     - `text_mkvdj8v3` → Email (Text)  \n     - `date_mkvdg4aa` → Start Date (Date)  \n     - `dropdown_mkvdjwra` → Engagement Type (Dropdown)  \n     - `dropdown_mkvdd9v3` → Campaign Type (Dropdown)  \n     - `text_mkvd2md9` → Campaign Type (as Text label)  \n     - `text_mkvd1bj2` → Instructions (Text)  \n     - `text_mkvd5w3y` → Domain (Text)  \n4. Update the **label → ID mappings** inside the Monday.com node if your dropdown IDs differ (e.g., `Engagement A` → `1`, `Engagement B` → `2`).\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Notes (best practices)\n- No secrets in nodes: store tokens in **n8n Credentials**.  \n- Use the included **Sticky Notes** for quick reference inside the workflow.  \n- Test once in Jotform to see the payload flow into Monday.\n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact  \nNeed help customizing this (e.g., extra fields, file uploads, or routing by campaign)?  \n\n- 📧 **rbreen@ynteractive.com**  \n- 🔗 **Robert Breen** — https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/  \n- 🌐 **ynteractive.com** — https://ynteractive.com\n",
