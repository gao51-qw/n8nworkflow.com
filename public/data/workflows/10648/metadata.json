  "description": "# Disclaimer\n\nPlease note - This workflow is only available on n8n self-hosted as it's making use of the community node for the Decodo Web Scraping\n\n![Search & Enrich: Smart Keyword Analysis with Decodo + OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini](fileId:3283)\n\nThis workflow automates intelligent keyword and topic extraction from Google Search results, combining **Decodo’s advanced scraping engine** with **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini’s semantic analysis capabilities**. The result is a fully automated keyword enrichment pipeline that gathers, analyzes, and stores SEO-relevant insights.\n\n\n## Who this is for\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* **SEO professionals** who want to extract high-value keywords from competitors.\n* **Digital marketers** aiming to automate topic discovery and keyword clustering.\n* **Content strategists** building data-driven content calendars.\n* **AI automation engineers** designing scalable web intelligence and enrichment pipelines.\n* **Growth teams** performing market and search intent research with minimal effort.\n\n## What problem this workflow solves\n\nManual keyword research is time-consuming and often incomplete. Traditional keyword tools only provide surface-level data and fail to uncover **contextual topics** or **semantic relationships** hidden in search results.\n\nThis workflow solves that by:\n\n* Automatically **scraping live Google Search results** for any keyword.\n* Extracting **meaningful topics, related terms, and entities** using AI.\n* Enriching your keyword list with **semantic intelligence** to improve SEO and content planning.\n* Storing structured results directly in **n8n Data Tables** for trend tracking or export.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the flow:\n\n1. **Set the Input Fields** – Define your search query and target geo (e.g., “Pizza” in “India”).\n2. **Decodo Google Search** – Fetches organic search results using Decodo’s web scraping API.\n3. **Return Organic Results** – Extracts the list of organic results and passes them downstream.\n4. **Loop Over Each Result** – Iterates through every search result description.\n5. **Extract Keywords and Topics** – Uses **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini** to identify relevant keywords, entities, and thematic topics from each snippet.\n6. **Data Enrichment Logic** – Checks whether each result already exists in the **n8n Data Table** (based on URL).\n7. **Insert or Skip** – If a record doesn’t exist, inserts the extracted data into the table.\n8. **Store Results** – Saves both enriched search data and Decodo’s original response to disk.\n\n**End Result:** A structured and deduplicated dataset containing URLs, keywords, and key topics — ready for SEO tracking or further analytics.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Pre-requisite\n\nIf you are new to Decode, please signup on this link [visit.decodo.com](https://visit.decodo.com/dOxzkK)\n\nPlease make sure to install the n8n custom node for Decodo.\n\n![Decodo Custom n8n Install](fileId:3250)\n![Decodo Custom n8n node](fileId:3251)\n\n### Import and Configure the Workflow\n\n1. Open n8n and **import** the JSON template.\n2. Add your credentials:\n\n   * **Decodo API Key** under *Decodo Credentials account*.\n   * **OpenAI API Key** under *OpenAI Account*.\n\n### Define Input Parameters\n\n* Modify the **Set node** to define:\n\n  * `search_query`: your keyword or topic (e.g., “AI tools for marketing”)\n  * `geo`: the target region (e.g., “United States”)\n\n### Configure Output\n\n* The workflow writes two outputs:\n\n  1. **Enriched keyword data** → Stored in n8n Data Table (`DecodoGoogleSearchResults`).\n  2. **Raw Decodo response** → Saved locally in JSON format.\n\n### Execute\n\nClick **Execute Workflow** or schedule it for recurring keyword enrichment (e.g., weekly trend tracking).\n\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n\n* **Change AI Model** — Replace `gpt-4.1-mini` with `gemini-1.5-pro` or `claude-3-opus` for testing different reasoning strengths.\n* **Expand the Schema** — Add extra fields like keyword difficulty, page type, or author info.\n* **Add Sentiment Analysis** — Chain a second AI node to assess tone (positive, neutral, or promotional).\n* **Export to Sheets or DB** — Replace the Data Table node with Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, or MySQL connectors.\n* **Multi-Language Research** — Pass a `locale` parameter in the Decodo node to gather insights in specific languages.\n* **Automate Alerts** — Add a Slack or Email node to notify your team when high-value topics appear.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Search & Enrich** is a low-code AI-powered keyword intelligence engine that automates research and enrichment for SEO, content, and digital marketing.\n\nBy combining **Decodo’s real-time SERP scraping** with **OpenAI’s contextual understanding**, the workflow transforms raw search results into structured, actionable keyword insights. It eliminates repetitive research work, enhances content strategy, and keeps your keyword database continuously enriched — all within n8n.",
