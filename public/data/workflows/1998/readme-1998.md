# WordPress-to-Pipedrive integration: Automating contact & lead management

> ## How it Works:

- **Capture Contact Requests:** This template efficiently handles contact requests coming through a WordPress website using the Contact Form 7 (CF7) plugin with a webhook extension.
- **Contact Management:** It automatically creates or updates contacts in Pipedrive upon receiving a new request.
- **Lead Management:** Each contact request is securely stored in the lead inbox of Pipedrive, ensuring no opportunity is missed.
- **Task Creation:** For each new contact or update, the workflow triggers the creation of a related task, streamlining follow-up actions.
- **Note Attachment:** A comprehensive note containing all details from the contact request is attached to the corresponding lead, ensuring that all information is readily accessible.

## Step-by-Step Guide:
**Estimated Setup Time:** The setup process is straightforward and can be completed quickly. Specific time may vary depending on your familiarity with n8n and the systems involved.

Detailed setup instructions are provided within the workflow via sticky notes. These notes offer in-depth guidance for configuring each component of the template to suit your specific needs.
