# Automate Bug Reports: GitHub Issues → AI Analysis → Jira Tickets with Slack & Discord Alerts

Automatically convert GitHub issues into analyzed Jira tickets with AI-powered severity detection, developer assignment, and instant team alerts.

## Overview

This workflow captures GitHub issues in real-time, analyzes them with GPT-4o for severity and categorization, creates enriched Jira tickets, assigns the right developers, and notifies your team across Slack and Discord—all automatically.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Triage**: GPT-4o analyzes bug severity, category, root cause, and generates reproduction steps
