# Automated Meeting Bot: Google Meet → AI Summary → Slack

## How it works
Automatically joins Google Meet calls, transcribes conversations, and posts AI-generated summaries to Slack - completely hands-free meeting notes for busy teams.

The workflow triggers when a Google Meet starts in your calendar, joins the meeting with a bot, waits for completion, then generates and posts a structured summary to your Slack channel.

## Set up steps
* Connect Google Calendar API for meeting detection
* Set up Vexa.ai account and obtain API key for meeting bot functionality  
* Configure OpenAI API credentials for AI-powered summarization
* Create Slack bot token and add to desired channel
* Update calendar ID and Slack channel in workflow settings
* Test with a sample meeting to verify end-to-end functionality
