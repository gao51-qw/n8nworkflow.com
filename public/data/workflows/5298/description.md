This n8n workflow allows you to automatically monitor the status of multiple URLs in a simple and efficient way. You just need to enter the URLs you want to scan and run the workflow (either manually or scheduled). For each URL, an availability check is performed. The results are logged in a Google Sheet, clearly distinguishing between successful checks and failures (downtime). If any URL fails, the system filters these errors and automatically sends an email alert notifying you of the detected outages.

The workflow includes help messages in both English and Spanish, integrates with Google Sheets and Gmail, and is suitable for both one-off tasks and scheduled monitoring.
