It will trigger when there is an error in another workflow. When this happens, it then tries to send an error notification to the preset Slack channel.\n\n# **How it works**\n\n- The **Error Trigger** node will trigger when there is an error in another workflow, as long as that workflow is set up to do so.\n- A error notification will be sent to the **Slack Channel**.\n\n# **Set up instructions**\n\n1. Create you **Slack credentials**, refer to [n8n integration documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=credential_settings&utm_campaign=create_new_credentials_modal) for more information.\n2. Set up the **Channel** in **👻 Exception Alert** node.\n3. For any n8n workflows to trigger this, switch to that workflow, select menu &gt; settings, and set the **Error Workflow** to **👻 Exception Flow.**\n\n# How to adjust it to your needs\n\nAlthough this workflow template is part of the **AI Chatbot Call Center Series**, it could be used with any n8n workflows.\n\n- Update the **Channel** in **👻 Exception Alert** to your own channel\n\nhttps://chatpaylabs.com/blog/part-8-build-your-own-ai-chatbot-call-center-general-exception-flow-production-ready-n8n-workflow-free-download-\n",
