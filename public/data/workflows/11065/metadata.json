Using AI and structured comparison, it generates a clean, secure workflow version, creates a downloadable sanitized file, and emails a detailed change-log report to the user.\n\n## Key Features\n• AI-powered sanitization of workflow JSON\n• Automatic removal of secrets, credentials,  \n  webhook IDs, and metadata\n• Node-level change detection and comparison\n• Generates sanitized workflow file (JSON)\n• Sends formatted HTML email report with \n  attachment\n• Supports customization for additional \n  filtering rules\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe user uploads a workflow JSON file, which is extracted and formatted.

A sanitized JSON file is created and emailed to the user with the report.\n\n## How to Use\n\nUpload your workflow JSON via the form. The workflow processes it automatically, generates a sanitized version, creates a change-log, and emails both the report and sanitized JSON file to you.\n\n## Requirements\n• OpenAI credentials\n• Gmail or SMTP credentials \n• n8n workflow JSON exported from the editor\n\n## Customising This Workflow\n\nModify sanitization rules, formatting logic, or email templates inside the JS and AI nodes to suit organizational security policies or custom metadata filtering.\n\n## Support: \n\nJoin n8n Discord https://discord.com/invite/n8n\nor\nCommunity Forum https://community.n8n.io/\n\nREADME file available at https://bit.ly/GeneratesanitizedJSONfile",
