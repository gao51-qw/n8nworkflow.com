  "description": "# What Most People Miss When Using Switch Nodes (and How to Fix It)\n\n## Switch Node Best Practice\n\nThe Switch node is powerful — but easy to misconfigure. Without a proper fallback, things can silently break. 🧨\n\nCommon pitfalls:\n- The value is null or undefined due to earlier workflow errors\n- Case mismatches (\"Yes\" vs \"yes\")\n- Type mismatches (3 as number vs \"3\" as string)\n- Forgotten or outdated conditions\n\n## ➡️ Best Practice:\nAlways enable the **“Fallback” option** and connect it to an Error or Notify node. This ensures misrouted executions don't silently fail — they alert you instead.\n\n**Protect your workflow logic, and save yourself hours of debugging. 🛠️**\n\n## 🚧 Reminder\n\nIf you run this workflow **it fails by design** — this is the intended behaviour as explained above. \nChange the Dummy Data Node to one of the valid values to make it succeed.\n\n---\n",
