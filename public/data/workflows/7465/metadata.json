  "description": "## 🤖📝 Auto-Document Workflows with GPT-4o-mini Sticky Notes  \n\nSkip the tedious part of writing documentation and turn your n8n workflows into **clear, shareable blueprints** — fully automated.  \n\nThis workflow takes any workflow JSON, parses its nodes, generates structured sticky notes (both per-node and a general overview), and arranges them neatly on your canvas. No more messy layouts or missing documentation — everything is handled in one click.  \n\nIt’s perfect if you want to **publish to the n8n marketplace**, onboard teammates quickly, or just keep your own automations easy to understand months later.  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 What this workflow does  \n✅ Loads your existing workflow from a JSON file  \n🔍 Parses and unwraps real nodes (ignoring old stickies)  \n🤖 Uses AI to create concise sticky notes for each node  \n📝 Adds a general overview sticky with goals, flow, parameters, and gotchas  \n📐 Arranges all nodes + stickies (node above, sticky below, right-to-left)  \n💾 Saves a new documented workflow JSON, ready to reuse or share  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Step-by-step setup  \n\n1. **Prepare your workflow file**  \n   - Export your n8n workflow JSON or point to an existing file path.  \n\n2. **Configure the “Load Workflow” node**  \n   - Update the file selector to your JSON path, e.g. `/workflows/myflow.json`.  \n\n3. **Add your OpenAI credentials**  \n   - In the *OpenAI API* nodes (`Node Sticky Notes` + `Overall Sticky Note`), insert your API key.  \n\n4. **Run the workflow**  \n   - Trigger manually with the `Execute Workflow` node.  \n   - The script will parse your nodes, generate stickies, and align them on the canvas.  \n\n5. **Save the result**  \n   - The “Save Documented Workflow” node writes a new file, e.g. `/workflows/myflow-with-sticky.json`.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Customization  \n\n- **Sticky layout:** Adjust spacing, colors, and alignment in the `Layout Blocks RTL` node (tweak `GAP_X`, `GAP_Y`, or `STICKY_COLOR`).  \n- **Word count & style:** Edit prompts inside the OpenAI nodes to make notes shorter, longer, or more technical.  \n- **Overview focus:** Customize the `Your Workflow Description` node to pass context (e.g., project goals, intended audience).  \n- **File outputs:** Save to a new path/version for version control of your documentation.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Limitations / Gotchas  \n\n- Maximum of ~50 nodes are summarized in the overview for brevity.  \n- Old sticky notes are removed and replaced — you can’t preserve them unless you fork the workflow.  \n- Complex nodes (large Code / AI prompts) may require manual edits for clarity.  \n- Ensure n8n has read/write access to your workflow JSON paths.  \n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Expected result  \n\nAfter execution, you’ll get a **fully documented workflow JSON** where each node is paired with a clean sticky note, plus an overview note neatly placed on the canvas. You can open this new file in n8n, share it, or submit it directly to the marketplace.  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact & Feedback  \n\nNeed help customizing this?
