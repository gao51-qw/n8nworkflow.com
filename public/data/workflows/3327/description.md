This workflow automates the `Mark as Fulfilled` action in Squarespace for each order, ensuring a seamless fulfillment process without manual intervention.

## How It Works
This workflow retrieves all pending Squarespace orders and processes their fulfillment automatically. The workflow follows these steps:

1️⃣ Get all pending orders using the HTTP Request node (Since Squarespace does not have a n8n node)
2️⃣ Create a fulfillment request using `Fulfill Order` node

The `Filter Orders` node can be used to filter valid pending order to process.

## Step-by-step
The workflow can be run as requested or on schedule

You can adjust these parameters within the Global and filter nodes:

### Global node for API Setting
- **api-version** (string, required) – The current API version (see Squarespace Orders API documentation).
- **modifiedAfter**={a-datetime} (string, conditional) – Fetch orders modified after a specific date (ISO 8601 format).
- **modifiedBefore**={b-datetime} (string, conditional) – Fetch orders modified before a specific date (ISO 8601 format).
- **cursor**={c} (string, conditional) – Used for pagination, cannot be combined with other filters.
- **fulfillmentStatus**={status} (optional, enum) – Filter by fulfillment status: PENDING, FULFILLED, or CANCELED.
- **maxPage** – Set -1 to enables infinite pagination to fetch all available orders.

### Filter Orders node
Order Filtering – Ensures only valid orders are fulfilled, particularly useful if:

- You sell digital downloads or gift cards exclusively.
- You use third-party fulfillment services for all products.

## Requirements
### Credentials
To use this workflow, you need:

- [Squarespace API Key](https://developers.squarespace.com/commerce-apis/authentication-and-permissions) – Retrieve from your Squarespace settings.

## Who Is This For?

Merchants selling digital or personalized products who need instant fulfillment.
