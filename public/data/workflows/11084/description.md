## 📘 Description
This workflow automates the full lifecycle of a data-consent complaint: receiving the complaint, validating the payload, normalizing the data into a clean ticket format, storing it in a compliance sheet, generating a formal acknowledgement email for the user, and sending an internal Slack alert for the compliance team. Everything moves from intake → classification → communication → escalation with zero manual handling. AI-generated messages follow DPDP-compliant tone and structure.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)

▶️ Receive Consent Complaint (Webhook)
 Accepts a POST request containing complaint details: name, email, issue type, description, and metadata.

🔍 Check Required Fields (IF)
 Validates that the complaint includes a non-empty description.
 Valid → processed
 Invalid → logged to a separate sheet.

🧹 Clean & Normalize Complaint Data (Code)
 Constructs a unified ticket object with:
auto-generated ticketId
normalized fields (action, email, issueType, description)
priority scoring
timestamp
source metadata
 Sets default status to Open.

📄 Log Invalid Complaint Records (Google Sheets)
 Stores incomplete submissions for later review.

📥 Store Complaint Ticket in Consent Dispute Sheet (Google Sheets)
 Appends the cleaned ticket into the Consent Dispute sheet including all metadata for traceability.

🧠 Generate Acknowledgement Email (AI)
 Creates a DPDP-compliant support email:
mentions user name
references ticket ID
summarizes issue
sets response window (48–72 hours)
avoids legal or internal disclosures
uses formal, respectful tone

⚙️ Configure GPT-4o – Email Generator
 Supplies the AI model for email generation.

📝 Extract Email Subject + Body (Code)
 Splits the AI-generated email into structured fields:
subject and message.

📧 Send Acknowledgement Email to User (Gmail)
 Delivers the formatted acknowledgement directly to the user who filed the complaint.

⚙️ Configure GPT-4o – Slack Summary Model
 Supplies the AI model for internal Slack summary generation.

🔔 Generate Slack Incident Summary (AI)
