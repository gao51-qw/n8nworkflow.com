This template is ideal for:

- Marketers seeking to efficiently produce engaging newsletters with AI-generated content and imagery.
- Anyone wanting to create and send personalized newsletters on a schedule.

## What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually creating and sending newsletters can be time-consuming, especially when including relevant and engaging content and imagery. This workflow automates the content generation (using AI and web search), image creation, and sending process, freeing up time and ensuring consistent communication with clients.

## What this workflow does:

This workflow automates the following steps:

**Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow is triggered automatically on a predefined schedule.

**Get Newsletter Topic:** Retrieves the first unpublished newsletter topic from a Google Sheet titled "Newsletter Topics". It then updates the status of this topic and records the publication date to avoid duplication in future runs.

**AI Newsletter & Image Generator:** This is the core content creation step. It uses an AI agent (configured with OpenAI and Perplexity APIs) to generate an engaging newsletter and a detailed, ultra-realistic image prompt based on the selected topic and real-time web research.

**GPT Image Generation:** Uses the OpenAI API to generate an image based on the detailed image prompt created in the previous step.

**Get Client List:** Retrieves client names and email addresses from a Google Sheet titled "Clients".

**Send Newsletter:** Sends the personalized newsletter via Gmail to each client on the list, including the AI-generated title, content, and the uploaded image. The email body HTML is customizable.

## Setup:

1.  **Configure the workflow's run frequency** within the "Schedule Trigger" node.

2.  **Create a Google Sheet named "Newsletter Topics" and "Clients"**  in your Google Drive.

3.  **Enter your OpenAI and Perplexity  API key** in the 'Input' node.

4.  **Connect your Gmail account** to the "SendNewsletter" node.

## How to customize this workflow:

**Adjust the prompt for your newsletter style** in the "AI Agent" node.

**Adjust the Email Body HTML for your newsletter style** in the "SendNewsletter" node.

Optionally, enable the "Tavily WebSearch" node and configure it if you prefer to use Tavily instead of Perplexity for web search.
