This workflow automates the content generation (using AI and web search), image creation, and sending process, freeing up time and ensuring consistent communication with clients.\n\n## What this workflow does:\n\nThis workflow automates the following steps:\n\n**Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow is triggered automatically on a predefined schedule.\n\n**Get Newsletter Topic:** Retrieves the first unpublished newsletter topic from a Google Sheet titled \"Newsletter Topics\". It then updates the status of this topic and records the publication date to avoid duplication in future runs.\n\n**AI Newsletter & Image Generator:** This is the core content creation step. It uses an AI agent (configured with OpenAI and Perplexity APIs) to generate an engaging newsletter and a detailed, ultra-realistic image prompt based on the selected topic and real-time web research.\n\n**GPT Image Generation:** Uses the OpenAI API to generate an image based on the detailed image prompt created in the previous step.\n\n**Get Client List:** Retrieves client names and email addresses from a Google Sheet titled \"Clients\".\n\n**Send Newsletter:** Sends the personalized newsletter via Gmail to each client on the list, including the AI-generated title, content, and the uploaded image. The email body HTML is customizable.\n\n## Setup:\n\n1.  **Configure the workflow's run frequency** within the \"Schedule Trigger\" node.\n\n2.  **Create a Google Sheet named \"Newsletter Topics\" and \"Clients\"**  in your Google Drive.\n\n3.  **Enter your OpenAI and Perplexity  API key** in the 'Input' node.\n\n4.  **Connect your Gmail account** to the \"SendNewsletter\" node.\n\n## How to customize this workflow:\n\n**Adjust the prompt for your newsletter style** in the \"AI Agent\" node.\n\n**Adjust the Email Body HTML for your newsletter style** in the \"SendNewsletter\" node.\n\nOptionally, enable the \"Tavily WebSearch\" node and configure it if you prefer to use Tavily instead of Perplexity for web search.\n\n## Category:\n\nMarketing, Content Creation, Automation",
