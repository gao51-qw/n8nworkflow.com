### 🔍 Features

- **Targeted Subreddit Monitoring:**  
  Searches multiple niche subreddits like `smallbusiness`, `startup`, `sweatystartup`, etc., using relevant keywords.

  Uses OpenAI GPT to analyze each post and determine if it’s written by someone who might benefit from your product, returning a simple “yes” or “no.”

  Ensures you don’t email the same lead more than once by storing already-processed Reddit post IDs in a Supabase table.

- **Content Filtering:**  
  Filters out posts with no body text or no upvotes to ensure only high-quality content is processed.

- **Lead Storage in Google Sheets:**  
  Saves qualified leads into a connected Google Sheet with key data (URL, post content, subreddit, and timestamp).

- **Email Digest Alerts:**  
  Compiles relevant leads and sends a daily digest of matched posts to your team’s inbox for review or outreach.
