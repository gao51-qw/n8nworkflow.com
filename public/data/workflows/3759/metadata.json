  "description": "**Automate AI-driven appointment booking with phone call confirmations, real-time lead validation, CRM updates, and email notifications—powered by n8n, OpenAI, VAPI.ai, and GoHighLevel.**\n\n# Tools & Services Used\n- GoHighLevel (CRM & appointment management)\n- VAPI.ai (AI phone calls)\n- OpenAI (GPT-4 for lead validation and post-call analysis)\n\n- Email Service (transactional email notifications)\n\n- n8n (Self-hosted required for Community Nodes)\n\n# Workflow Overview\n## This automation performs the following steps:\n\n- Trigger: A new lead arrives via the GHL Webhook.\n\n- Validation: OpenAI (GPT-4) checks lead quality and relevance.\n\n- AI Phone Call: VAPI.ai initiates an automated call to confirm appointment details.\n\n- Post-Call Analysis: OpenAI interprets the call result (booking_made=YES/NO).\n\n## Conditional Actions:\n\nIf YES: Updates GoHighLevel CRM and sends confirmation emails to the client and owner.\n\nIf NO: Alerts the owner via email about the failed booking.\n\n# Prerequisites\nActive accounts and API keys for:\n\n- GoHighLevel (webhook setup)\n- VAPI.ai (phone call API)\n- OpenAI (GPT-4 access)\n- Email service (e.g., SMTP, SendGrid, or Gmail)\n\n# How to Use This Template\n## Step 1: Import the Template\n\nImport the JSON into your self-hosted n8n instance (requires Community Nodes like @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain).\n\n## Step 2: Configure Credentials\n\nGHL Webhook: Replace YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID with your GoHighLevel webhook ID.\n\nOpenAI Nodes: Add your OpenAI API key (replace placeholder BxLbA94QZt0ifZsC).\n\nVAPI Call Node: Ensure the VAPI.ai endpoint (https://api.vapi.ai/call/phone) has valid API credentials.\n\nEmail Nodes: Configure SMTP or API credentials for your email service.\n\n## Step 3: Enable Disabled Nodes\n\nActivate the Post-call Analysis node if needed (disabled by default).\n\nFinding Your GHL Webhook ID\nIn GoHighLevel, navigate to Automations → Webhooks.\n\nCreate a new webhook and copy its unique ID into the GHL Webhook node.\n\n# Initial Test Run\nSimulate a Lead: Manually trigger the GHL webhook with test lead data.\n\n# Debugging:\n\nVerify OpenAI validates the lead.\n\nCheck if VAPI.ai initiates a call (use a test phone number).\n\nConfirm CRM updates and emails are sent conditionally.\n\n# Production Prep:\n\nEnable error-handling loops for failed calls.\n\nAdjust GPT-4 prompts for stricter validation.\n\n# Use Cases\n- Medical Clinics: Reduce no-shows with automated appointment confirmations.\n\n- Salons/Spas: Streamline booking updates and client reminders.\n\n- Consultants: Sync client meetings to CRM in real time.\n\n# Disclaimer\nRequires self-hosted n8n (Community Nodes are unsupported on n8n Cloud).\n\nTest phone call and email nodes extensively before scaling.\n\n\n",
