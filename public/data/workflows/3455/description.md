### Automatically Generate Content and Post to Bluesky with LLM Workflow

Unlock the power of automation with the **Automatically Generate Content and Post to Bluesky with LLM Workflow**, an n8n-powered solution that uses Large Language Model (LLM) APIs to create engaging content and seamlessly posts it to Bluesky. Say goodbye to manual content creation and posting—streamline your social media presence in minutes!

---

#### How It Works
This workflow harnesses an LLM API (like Openai or your preferred model) to generate tailored content based on your input prompts. Once the content is created, it’s formatted to fit Bluesky’s requirements (e.g., under 300 characters), authenticated via the Bluesky API, and posted automatically. Built-in checks ensure error-free execution, making your content strategy seamless and efficient.

#### Set Up Steps (10-15 Minutes)
1. **Authenticate Bluesky**: Add your Bluesky API credentials (username and app password in your Bluesky settings).
2. **Configure LLM API**: Connect your chosen LLM API (e.g., Groq) with your API key.
3. **Set Prompt**: Define a system prompt in the LLM node (e.g., “Write a witty Bluesky post about AI automation”).
4. **Test Workflow**: Run it manually to verify content generation and posting.
5. **Schedule (Optional)**: Set a cron node to automate posts (e.g., daily at 9 AM).

Total setup time: 10-15 minutes, depending on familiarity with n8n.
