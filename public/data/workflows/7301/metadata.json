  "description": "![wflow preview.JPG](fileId:2054)\nLet AI classify your incoming emails and draft replies.\nUse gotoHuman to approve emails before they are sent out. It also lets you manually edit the draft or even ask for a retry.\n\n## How it works\n1. The workflow is triggered for each new email which gets passed to an **AI classification agent**.\nIt assigns the email to one of the categories defined in the prompt (Customer Support, Sales opportunity, Promo, Personal,...). The agent also determines whether a reply is needed and if it is important.\n2. If a reply is needed, we ask the **AI Email Writer** to draft a response. Even if it is missing context it can help us draft an outline for the response.\n3. The email draft is sent to **gotoHuman** where the reviewer can manually edit it or ask to regenerate it with the option to even edit the prompt (Retries loop back to the _AI Email Writer_ node)\n![gthreview.JPG](fileId:2053)\n![gthchat.JPG](fileId:2052)\n4. Approved email replies are automatically sent from the workflow\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Most importantly, install the gotoHuman node before importing this template!**\n(Just add the node to a blank canvas before importing)\n2. Set up your credentials for gotoHuman, OpenAI, and Gmail\n3. In gotoHuman, select and create the pre-built review template \"Email agent\" or import the ID: `v81wzxwYoFYvWpmuIBgX`\n4. Select this template in the gotoHuman node\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou need accounts for\n- gotoHuman (human supervision)\n- OpenAI (classification, drafting)\n- Gmail\n\n## How to customize\n\n- Change the predefined categories in the prompt of the _AI classification agent_\n- Provide the _AI Email Writer_ with more context to create replies. Consider adding tools that allow the agent to fetch more infos about clients, your calendar, FAQs for your product,...",
