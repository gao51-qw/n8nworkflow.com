It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o model to interpret natural language commands and perform various Jira-related actions. On Telegram, it enables users to create Jira stories by triggering a guided form when prompted with \"create story.\" Additionally, it provides more extensive functionality, including creating, updating, searching, and transitioning Jira issues through natural language commands.\n\n## How it works\n**Normal interaction** \nUsing messages as \"Please give all my issues\".\n\n**Standardized process of creating stories:** \n1. Message: \"create story\"\n2. Open the Form that Telegram responds back to you\n3. Fill in the essential story information in the form\n4.
