# Auto-generate competitive battle cards from websites with Zoho CRM and Gemini AI

> # Zoho CRM → AI‑Generated Competitive Battle Card 

This workflow automatically analyzes competitor websites, which inseted in description field and generates a clean, structured AI‑powered Battle Card for every new Zoho CRM deal. It reads the competitor URL from the deal Description, scrapes the site, runs an AI analysis pipeline and updates the deal with pricing, differentiators, pros/cons and a concise sales battle summary — all fully automated.


### Quick Implementation Steps

1. Add Zoho CRM + Gmail OAuth2 + AI API credentials. 
2. Import workflow into n8n. 
3. create a new deal in zoho CRM.
4. While creating Deal,Add a competitor URL inside the Zoho deal Description. 
5. Activate the workflow. 
6. Wait 5 minutes → Deal updates with AI‑generated Battle Card.


## What It Does
This workflow removes the manual effort of researching competitors during a sales cycle. Every time a new deal is created, it checks the Description field for a competitor name and website. After validating both, it automatically fetches the competitor webpage and feeds the content into an AI analysis pipeline powered by LangChain.

The AI transforms the messy, unstructured webpage HTML into a readable, structured and ready‑to‑use Battle Card — including pricing overview, differentiating features, advantages, disadvantages and a compact sales battle summary. This data is pushed directly into the Deal Description and emailed to the sales team. No web research, no copy‑pasting, no manual formatting — the AI does everything.


## Who’s It For

- Sales teams wanting fast competitor intelligence. 
- SDR/BDR teams prepping before first calls.

## How It Works & Setup

### Step 1 — Cron Trigger  
Runs every 5 minutes → pulls newly created deals and last run time.

### Step 2 — Fetch Deals  
Retrieves deals sorted by Created_Time.

### Step 3 — Identify New Deals  
Filters deals created after the last workflow run.

### Step 4 — Validate Deal Description  
Ensures the Description has: 
- Competitor name 
- Competitor website URL

### Step 5 — Extract Competitor Info  
Regex identifies and extracts the name + first valid URL in the Description.

### Step 6 — Scrape Competitor Website  
HTTP Request downloads the competitor webpage’s HTML.

### Step 7 — AI‑Generated Battle Card Creation  

The AI pipeline (LangChain + your chosen LLM) transforms HTML into a structured JSON output containing: 
- Pricing Summary 
- Key Features 
- Pros 
- Cons 
- Battle Summary 
- Competitor Name

### Step 8 — Update Zoho Deal  
The script saves the formatted AI Battle Card directly into the Deal Description.
