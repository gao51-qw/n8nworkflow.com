## Who is this for
This workflow is designed for **Innovation Managers**, **Tech Transfer Offices**, and **Business Development Representatives** looking to find commercial partners for new technologies.

## What it does
This template automates the process of scouting startups that might be a good fit for NASA patents.

1. **Search**: It fetches patents from the NASA Tech Transfer API based on a keyword you define.
2. **Find**: It searches Google to identify startups operating in related fields.
3. **Enrich**: It crawls the identified startup's website to extract context about their business.
4. **Analyze**: Using OpenAI, it scores the "fit" between the patent and the startup and drafts a personalized outreach email.
5. **Save**: High-scoring leads are enriched with LinkedIn company pages and saved directly to a Notion database.

## How to set up
1. **Configuration**: In the **Configuration** node, set the `keyword` variable to the technology topic you want to search for (e.g., "robotics").
2. **NASA API**: Get a free API key from `api.nasa.gov` and enter it in the **NASA Patents API** node parameters.
3. **Apify**: Connect your Apify account credential. You will need credits to run the `google-search-scraper` and `website-content-crawler` actors.
