  "description": "## Who it’s for\nBuilt for Customer Success and Account Management teams focused on proactive retention. This workflow helps you automatically identify at-risk customers – before they churn – by combining CRM, usage, and sentiment data into one actionable alert.\n\n## What it does\nThis end-to-end workflow continuously monitors customer health by consolidating data from HubSpot and Google Sheets.\nHere’s how it works:\n* Fetch deals from HubSpot.\n* Collect context — linked support tickets and feature usage from a Google Sheet.\n* Run sentiment analysis on the tickets to generate a customer health score.\n* Evaluate risk — an AI agent reviews deal age, sentiment score, and usage trends against predefined thresholds.\n* Send alerts — if churn risk is detected, it automatically sends a clear, data-driven email to the responsible team member with next-step recommendations.\n\n## How to set it up\nTo get started, configure your credentials and parameters in the following nodes:\n\n1.  **Credentials:**\n    * **HubSpot:** Connect your account (`HubSpot: Get All Deals`).\n    * **LLM Model:** Add credentials for your preferred provider (`Config: Set LLM for Agent & Chains`).\n    * **Google Sheets:** Connect your account (`Tool: Get Feature Usage from Sheets`).\n    * **Email:** Set up your SMTP credentials (`Email: Send Churn Alert`).\n2.  **Tool URLs:**\n    * In **Tool: Calculate Sentiment Score**, enter the **Webhook URL** from the `Trigger: Receive Tickets for Scoring` node within this same workflow.\n    * In **Tool: Get HubSpot Data**, enter the **Endpoint URL** for your MCP HubSpot data workflow. *(Note: This tool *does* call an external workflow)*.\n3.  **Google Sheet:**\n    * In **Tool: Get Feature Usage from Sheets**, enter the Document ID for your own Google Sheet.\n4.  **Email Details:**\n    * In **Email: Send Churn Alert**, change the `From` and `To` email addresses.\n\n## Requirements\n* HubSpot account with Deals API access\n* LLM provider account (e.g. OpenAI)\n* Google Sheets tracking customer feature usage\n* n8n with LangChain community nodes enabled\n* A separate n8n workflow set up to act as an MCP endpoint for fetching HubSpot data (called by `Tool: Get HubSpot Data`).\n\n## How to customize it\nTailor this workflow to match your business logic:\n* **Scoring logic:** Adjust the JavaScript in the `Code: Convert Sentiment to Score` node to redefine how customer scores are calculated.\n* **Alert thresholds:** Update the prompt in the `AI Chain: Analyze for Churn Risk` node to fine-tune when alerts trigger (e.g. deal age, score cutoff, or usage drop).\n* **Data sources:** Swap HubSpot or Google Sheets for your CRM or database of choice — like Salesforce or Airtable.\n\n✅ **Outcome:** A proactive customer health monitoring system that surfaces risks before it’s too late — keeping your team focused on prevention, not firefighting.",
