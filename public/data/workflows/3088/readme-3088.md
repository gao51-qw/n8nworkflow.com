# Generate 🤖🧠 AI-powered video 🎥 from image and upload it on Google Drive

> 
This workflow automates the process of generating **AI-powered video from image** and then generates a video that is uploaded to **Google Drive**. 

This workflow is a powerful tool for automating the creation of AI-generated videos from images, saving time and ensuring a seamless process from input to final output.

Below is a breakdown of the workflow:

---

#### **1. How It Works**
The workflow is designed to create videos from images using AI and manage the generated content. Here's how it works:

1. **Form Submission**:
   - The workflow starts with a **Form Trigger** node, where users submit a form with the following fields:
     - **Description**: The text description for the video.
     - **Duration (in seconds)**: The length of the video.
     - **Aspect Ratio**: The aspect ratio of the video (e.g., 16:9, 9:16, 1:1).
     - **Image URL**: The URL of the image to be used for video generation.

2. **Set Data**:
   - The **Set Data** node organizes the form inputs into a structured format for further processing.

3. **Create Video**:
   - The **Create Video** node sends a POST request to generate the video.
   - The request includes the description, image URL, duration, and aspect ratio.

4. **Wait and Check Status**:
   - The **Wait 60 sec.** node pauses the workflow for 60 seconds to allow the video generation process to complete.
   - The **Get Status** node checks the status of the video generation by querying the API.

5. **Completed?**:
   - The **Completed?** node checks if the video generation is complete. If not, the workflow loops back to wait and check again.

6. **Retrieve and Upload Video**:
   - Once the video is generated, the **Get Url Video** node retrieves the video URL.
   - The **Get File Video** node downloads the video file.
   - The **Upload Video** node uploads the video to a specified folder in **Google Drive**.

#### **2. Set Up Steps**
To set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:

1. **API Key**:
   - Create an account on account and obtain your **API Key**.
   - In the **Create Video** node, set up **HTTP Header Authentication**:
     - **Name**: `Authorization`
     - **Value**: `Key YOURAPIKEY`

2. **Google Drive Integration**:
   - Set up **Google Drive** credentials in n8n for the **Upload Video** node.
   - Specify the folder ID in Google Drive where the generated videos will be uploaded.

3. **Form Configuration**:
   - The **Form Trigger** node is pre-configured with fields for:
     - **Description**: The text description for the video.
     - **Duration (in seconds)**: The length of the video.
     - **Aspect Ratio**: Choose between 16:9, 9:16, or 1:1.
     - **Image URL**: The URL of the image to be used for video generation.
   - Customize the form fields if needed.

4. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Submit the form with the required details (description, duration, aspect ratio, and image URL).
   - The workflow will:
     - Generate the video using the API.
     - Check the status until the video is ready.
     - Upload the video to Google Drive.

5. **Optional Customization**:
   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:
     - Adding more aspect ratio options.
     - Sending notifications when the video is ready.
     - Integrating with other storage services (e.g., Dropbox, AWS S3).
