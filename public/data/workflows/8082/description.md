# Nano Banana AI Image Editor

Transform your Telegram photos with AI-powered image processing using the revolutionary Nano Banana technology. This workflow automatically receives photos via Telegram, processes them through Google's advanced Gemini 2.5 Flash vision model, and sends back intelligently enhanced images - all powered by the innovative Nano Banana processing pipeline.

## Who's it for

Perfect for content creators, social media managers, photographers, and anyone who wants to automatically enhance their Telegram photos with AI. Whether you're running a photo editing service, creating content for clients, or just want smarter image processing in your personal chats, the Nano Banana AI editor delivers professional-grade results.

## How it works

The Nano Banana workflow creates an intelligent Telegram bot that processes images in real-time. When you send a photo with a caption to your bot, it automatically downloads the image, converts it to the proper format, sends it to Google's Gemini AI for analysis and enhancement, then returns the processed result. The Nano Banana engine optimizes every step for speed and quality.
