In this workflow template, I demonstrate how to leverage Baserow as a centralized platform for organizing your marketing campaign assets, including copy and images. By utilizing n8n, we automate the process of fetching images and campaign descriptions from Baserow and uploading them directly to your Shopify store.

With this automated solution, you can expedite the publishing process, ensuring that your campaigns are launched swiftly across your sales channels. Additionally, this workflow serves as a foundational step towards further automation in campaign management, allowing you to dynamically generate and upload content to your Shopify store with ease.
