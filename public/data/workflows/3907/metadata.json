  "description": "This workflow allows you to generate riddle-themed vertical videos (9:16), render them using Creatomate, and upload them directly to YouTube — all automatically. It's optimized for low-cost operation while still integrating AI and automation at key stages.\n\nHere is a sample: [https://youtube.com/shorts/svhgti9L6Fw?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/svhgti9L6Fw?feature=share)\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Workflow Overview\n\nThis is a **schedule-triggered** workflow that:\n\n1. **Generates riddles with answers** using an AI agent.\n2. **Checks Pinecone** vector store to avoid repeating riddles.\n3. **Inserts new riddles** into Pinecone under a namespace structured by `month/year` for easier indexing.\n4. **Fetches an unused music track URL** for video background.\n5. **Generates a video** using Creatomate with the riddles and audio.\n6. **Uploads the video to YouTube** via a custom HTTP request with OAuth.\n7. **Updates the worksheet and riddle numbering**, and notifies via email.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Integration Guide\n\n#### 🔎 Pinecone Setup\n\n* You need an active Pinecone account with an index created.\n* The vector index should be accessible from n8n.\n* Follow \\[n8n's Pinecone Node Documentation] for help setting up credentials and connecting.\n\n#### 📝 Google Sheet Setup\n\n1. Open the sheets template provided in the Gumroad documentation pdf.\n2. Make a copy to your Google Drive.\n3. Set up the required credentials in n8n and link the Google Sheets node to your new copy.\n\n#### 🎧 Audio Tracks\n\n* Get copyright-free tracks from [Royalty Free Music Library](https://royaltyfreemusiclibrary.com/).\n* Ensure files are in `.mp3` format for compatibility.\n\n#### 🎞️ Background Videos (Optional)\n\n* For optional background visuals, use free stock videos from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/videos/).\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Creatomate Setup\n\n1. Create a Creatomate account at \\[creatomate.com].\n2. Create a **9:16 aspect ratio** template.\n3. Press **F12** to open the source editor.\n4. Download the Creatomate JSON file from the Gumroad page and paste its contents into the source editor.\n5. Refresh the page and click **\"Use Template\" &gt; API Integration**.\n6. Copy the **cURL**.\n7. From the cURL, extract your `Bearer Token` and `Template ID`.\n8. Paste them in the respective fields in the `Creatomate Render Node` inside n8n.\n\n---\n\n### 📉 YouTube Upload Configuration\n\n1. Inside n8n, set up a **YouTube OAuth credential**.\n2. Search for \"YouTube\" in the credentials list and select the OAuth type.\n3. Use the Custom HTTP Request node with `multipart/form-data` to upload the video using:\n\n   * Title (e.g., \"Riddles4U #001\")\n   * Description\n   * Video file binary\n   * Category ID (find ID here: [https://gist.github.com/dgp/1b24bf2961521bd75d6c](https://gist.github.com/dgp/1b24bf2961521bd75d6c))\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Workflow Logic Detail\n\n1. **Riddle Generation**\n\n   * Checks Pinecone vector store for existing riddles (to avoid duplicates).\n   * Generates 4 new riddles with answers.\n   * Stores them in Pinecone under `month/year` namespace.\n   * Extracts a numbered title for current riddle post (e.g., Riddles4U #001).\n   * Prepares next riddle title counter (but only updates after YouTube post succeeds).\n\n2. **Track URL Fetching**\n\n   * Pulls the first unused track from Google Sheets.\n\n3. **Render & Upload**\n\n   * Sends the riddles + track to Creatomate for rendering.\n   * Fetches binary video and uploads it directly to YouTube via HTTP.\n   * Note: For video source url, I downloaded a video, uploaded it to drive and used that video drive link. You can add a new sheet and rotate videos too, although youtube likes consistency in shorts so I think it is best to have one very beautiful and calm background video then change to a new one after some months or when you generate like 50 shorts. \n\n\n4. **Post Actions**\n\n   * Sends email with YouTube video link.\n   * Marks used audio row as \"used\".\n   * Updates to next riddle title.\n   * If all tracks have been used, resets them to \"unused\".\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Customization Ideas\n\n* Add AI-generated voiceover to the riddles.\n* Replace riddles with trivia, quotes, or jokes.\n* Integrate TikTok or Instagram upload APIs for multichannel publishing.\n\n---\n\n### ✉️ Support\n\nRefer to the **comprehensive setup guide** included in the Gumroad download folder to configure your template, credentials, and API keys correctly.\n\nThis is a beginner-friendly, low-cost automation you can build on for more advanced content pipelines.
