**Who is This For?**
This is for normal people or people just starting off and wanting to have a AI chatbot that can process data to use when talking to the user.

**How to Use**
You will need to have your own OpenRouter (Free) and OpenAI APIs as well as Google Drive, Pinecone, and Airtable.

**What Do You Want?**
If you want to have your AI Agent remember the user's preferences even after the session is over then you can keep the Airtable node in, if not you can delete it.
