  "description": "## ==Reason Of The Workflow==\nThis **n8n workflow** automatically shares content from a **Telegram Channel** to multiple platforms like **WordPress**, **Facebook**, **X/Twitter**, and **LinkedIn**. It uses a **Switch** node to detect the type of content—text, image, video, audio, or document—and sends it to the right processing and publishing nodes for each platform.\n\n## Who Is This For?\nThis workflow is ideal for **content creators, marketers, and organizations** who use a **Telegram Channel as their main content hub**. It eliminates the need for manual, repetitive posting across different social media and blogging platforms by instantly detecting new posts in Telegram and distributing them according to their content type.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\nThe SocialVibe workflow is a sophisticated automation designed to handle diverse media types and publishing requirements:\n* **Real-Time Triggering:** It instantly activates upon the detection of a new message (`channel_post` event) in your configured Telegram Channel.\n* **Intelligent Content Detection:** It uses a **Switch** node and a **Code** node to analyze the Telegram payload and correctly identify the type of content posted (e.g., plain text, image, video, audio, or document).\n* **Platform-Specific Publishing:** It tailors the publishing action for each platform, ensuring images go to the WordPress media library, text becomes a Tweet, etc.\n* **Caption-as-Text:** The Telegram post's caption is automatically used as the post body, Tweet text, or blog post content/excerpt.\n\n\n## Key Features\n* **Versatile Media Support:** Handles over 9 different content types (Text, Photo, Video, Audio, Document, etc.).\n* **Dedicated WordPress Integration:**\n    * Creates a new post/article.\n    * Uses an **Edit Image**automatically resize images to optimize for web upload.\n    * Uploads the image to the WordPress Media Library via **HTTP Request**.\n    * Sets the uploaded image as the post's **Featured Image**.\n* **Broad Social Media Reach:** Supports cross-posting to **X/Twitter, Facebook Page, LinkedIn Profile, and LinkedIn Page**.\n* **Customizable Settings:** Easily adjust WordPress categories, post status, and platform-specific settings like LinkedIn target IDs.\n\n\n## Required Credentials & Accounts\n1.  **Telegram Bot Token:** The bot must be an administrator in the source channel.\n2.  **WordPress API Credentials:** For REST API access (username/password or application password).\n3.  **Facebook Graph API Credentials:** With permissions to post to the target Page.\n4.  **LinkedIn OAuth2 Credentials:** To post on a Profile and/or Company Page.\n5.  **Twitter/X OAuth2 Credentials:** For publishing tweets.\n\n\n## How to Use — Step-by-Step Setup\n1.  **Set Up All Credentials:**\n    * Configure all necessary API credentials (Telegram, WordPress, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter) within your n8n instance.\n2.  **Configure Telegram Trigger:**\n    * Ensure the **Telegram Trigger** node is set to listen for the `channel_post` update type.\n3.  **Customize WordPress Nodes:**\n    * Update the `Create WordPress Post` node with your desired **Category ID** (currently set to `1`) and ensure the **Status** is set to `publish` (or `draft` for safety testing).\n    * In the **HTTP Request** nodes (used for WordPress media upload), replace the placeholder URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.myshopify.com/`) with your actual **WordPress site domain**.\n4.  **Update Social Media Target IDs:**\n    * **LinkedIn:** Update the **Person ID** (e.g., `PghXXXXnRg`) and **Organization ID** (e.g., `109XXX908`) in the respective LinkedIn nodes to match your profile and company page.\n    * **Telegram Send/Repost:** Update the `chatId` (e.g., `-10025XXXX5258`) in the sending Telegram nodes to match the channel or group you want to cross-post to.\n\n## Support & Help\n- **WhatsApp**: [Chat on WhatsApp](https://wa.me/8801322827799)\n- **Discord**: [SpaGreen Community](https://discord.gg/SsCChWEP)\n- **Facebook Group**: [SpaGreen Support](https://www.facebook.com/groups/spagreenbd)\n- **Website**: [https://spagreen.net](https://spagreen.net)\n- **Developer Portfolio**: [Codecanyon SpaGreen](https://codecanyon.net/user/spagreen/portfolio)",
