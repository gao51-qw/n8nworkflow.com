  "description": "**Use Cases**\nAnalyze e-commerce product pages for conversion optimization, audit SaaS landing pages for signup improvements, or evaluate marketing campaign pages for better lead generation.\n\n**Good to know**\n* At time of writing, Google Gemini API calls have usage costs. See Google AI Pricing for current rates.\n* The workflow analyzes publicly accessible pages only - pages behind login walls or with restricted access won't work.\n* Analysis quality depends on page content structure - heavily image-based pages may receive limited text-based recommendations.\n\n**How it works**\n* User submits a landing page URL through the form trigger interface.\n* The HTTP Request node fetches the complete HTML content from the target landing page.\n* Content is converted from HTML to markdown format for cleaner AI processing and better text extraction.\n* Google Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes the page using expert CRO knowledge and 2024 conversion best practices.\n* The AI generates specific, actionable recommendations based on actual page content rather than generic advice.\n* Information Extractor processes the analysis into 5 prioritized improvement tips with relevant visual indicators.\n* Results are delivered through a completion form showing concrete steps to improve conversion rates.\n\n**How to use**\n* The form trigger is configured for direct URL submission but can be replaced with webhook triggers for integration into existing websites or apps.\n* Multiple pages can be analyzed sequentially, though each requires a separate workflow execution.\n* Recommendations focus on high-impact changes that don't require heavy development work.\n\n**Requirements**\n* Google Gemini (PaLM) API account for AI-powered analysis\n* Publicly accessible landing pages for analysis\n* N8N instance with proper webhook configuration\n\n**Customizing this workflow**\n* CRO analysis can be tailored for specific industries by modifying the AI system prompt - try focusing on e-commerce checkout flows, SaaS trial conversions, or local business lead capture forms.\n* Add competitive analysis by incorporating multiple URL inputs and comparative recommendations.",
