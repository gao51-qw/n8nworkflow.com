Without visibility into usage, it’s easy to lose track of API spending.\n\nThis workflow solves that problem by:\n- Logging token counts and costs to Google Sheets\n- Supporting prompt and completion token counts\n- Providing live pricing (optional, via Jina AI API)\n\n### ⚙️ What this workflow does\nThis template allows you to analyze the token usage and cost of **any** workflow in n8n. It uses an `Execute Workflow` node to call the `Token Estim8r` utility, which:\n- Estimates prompt and completion tokens\n- Retrieves model pricing (either statically or live via Jina API)\n- Calculates the total cost\n- Logs the data to a connected Google Sheet with timestamp and model info\n\n### 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n1. **Create Google Sheet**: Copy and paste the CSV template below into a `.csv` file and upload to Google Sheets:\n\n    ```\n    timestamp, Total Tokens, Prompt Tokens, Completion Tokens, Models Used, Tools Used, Total Cost, Json Array\n    ```\n\n2. **Set up pricing (optional)**: In the `Get AI Pricing` node, add your Jina API Auth Header if you want live pricing.\n\n3. **Select the correct Google Sheet**: Ensure your workflow is pointing to the imported sheet.\n\n4. **Attach to your target workflow**: Add an `Execute Workflow` node to the end of your target workflow.\n\n5. **Point to this Token Estim8r**: Choose this template as the executed workflow and send `{{ $execution.id }}` as the input.\n\n6. **Run and view results**: Trigger the target workflow and see your token usage and cost data populate in the sheet.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Change the logging destination**: Instead of Google Sheets, connect to Airtable, Notion, or a database.\n- **Support multiple models**: Extend the price-mapping logic to cover your own model providers.\n- **Add Slack alerts**: Send a notification if a workflow exceeds a token or cost threshold.\n- **Aggregate costs**: Create a weekly summary workflow that totals cost by workflow or model.\n\n---\n\n&gt; This utility workflow works across all n8n deployment types and uses only built-in nodes.",
