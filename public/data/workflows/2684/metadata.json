  "description": "## Introduction:\n\nThis workflow template helps you determine if a Twitch user's stream is currently live or offline.\n\n## Setup Instructions:\n\nThe Document node holds the sample Twitch username you wish to check, you may adapt it in your workflow by replacing this with a chain that contains the Twitch username you want to check. This value is passed to the GraphQL node query as `$('Document').item.json.twitch` so make sure to change this based on your workflow.\n\n## How it Works:\n\nThe important nodes here are the `GrapQL` and `IF` nodes. The GrapQL queries the Twitch API, and then the output returns a document with the `stream` property. The IF node then checks if this property has a value, if `null` means the user is offline, otherwise the user is online or live.\n\n## Common Use Cases:\nYou can use this with other workflow templates to post live stream alerts to Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Discord via webhooks, etc to notify your community to join youR stream. You may also use an `LLM` node to write a custom alert based on the value of property `title`\n\n## How to adjust this template\nIf you want to check a list of Twitch channels, you can simply exchange the `Document` set node in the beginning with your list of channels.\n\n\nFor more information on the GraphQL output please see the official Twitch API documentation: [Get Streams](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams)",
