  "description": "## 📌 Validate Seatable Webhooks with HMAC SHA256 Authentication\n\nThis mini workflow is designed to **securely validate incoming Seatable webhooks** using HMAC SHA256 signature verification.\n\n### 🔐 What it does:\n- Listens for incoming Seatable webhook requests.\n- Calculates a SHA256 HMAC hash of the raw request body using your shared secret.\n- Compares the computed hash with the `x-seatable-signature` header (after removing the `sha256=` prefix).\n- If the hashes match: responds with **200 OK** and forwards the request to subsequent nodes.\n- If the hashes don’t match: responds with **403 Forbidden**.\n\n### ⚠️ Important Notes:\nThis workflow is provided as a **template** and is not intended to work standalone. **Please duplicate it** and integrate it with your custom logic at the \"Add nodes for processing\" node.\n\nConfiguration steps:\n- Set your **secret key** in the “Calculate sha256” crypto node (replace the placeholder).\n- Adjust the webhook path to suit your environment (or set it to \"manual\" for testing).\n- Connect your actual logic after the verification step.\n",
