# Overview

This n8n workflow monitors your HubSpot instance for newly created contacts and automatically enriches them with additional contact information. When a contact is created, the workflow:

1. Detects the new contact via HubSpot webhook trigger
2. Retrieves recent contact details from HubSpot
3. Matches the contact against Explorium's database using name, company, and email
4. Enriches the contact with professional emails and phone numbers
5. Updates the HubSpot contact record with discovered information

This automation ensures your sales and marketing teams have complete contact information, improving outreach success rates and data quality.

# Key Features

* **Real-time Webhook Trigger**: Instantly processes new contacts as they're created
* **Intelligent Matching**: Uses multiple data points (name, company, email) for accurate matching
* **Comprehensive Enrichment**: Adds both professional and work emails, plus phone numbers
* **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple contacts to optimize API usage
* **Smart Data Mapping**: Intelligently maps multiple emails and phone numbers
* **Profile Enrichment**: Optional additional enrichment for deeper contact insights
* **Error Resilience**: Continues processing other contacts if some fail to match

# Prerequisites

## Node Descriptions

1. **HubSpot Trigger**: Webhook that fires when new contacts are created
2. **HubSpot Recently Created**: Fetches details of recently created contacts
3. **Loop Over Items**: Processes contacts in batches of 6
4. **Explorium Match Prospects**: Finds matching person in Explorium database
5. **Filter**: Validates successful matches
6. **Extract Prospect IDs**: Collects matched prospect identifiers
7. **Enrich Contacts Information**: Fetches emails and phone numbers
8. **Enrich Profiles**: Gets additional profile data (optional)
9. **Merge**: Combines all enrichment results
10. **Split Out**: Separates individual enriched records
11. **Update HubSpot**: Updates contact with new information

## Data Mapping Logic

The workflow maps Explorium data to HubSpot properties:

| Explorium Data                 | HubSpot Property   | Notes                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `professions_email`            | `email`            | Primary professional email    |
| `emails[].address`             | `work_email`       | All email addresses joined    |
| `phone_numbers[].phone_number` | `phone`            | All phones joined with commas |
| `mobile_phone`                 | `phone` (fallback) | Used if no other phones found |

## Data Processing

The workflow handles complex data scenarios:

* **Multiple emails**: Joins all discovered emails with commas
* **Phone numbers**: Combines all phone numbers into a single field
* **Missing data**: Uses "null" as placeholder for empty fields
* **Name parsing**: Cleans sample data and special characters

# Usage & Operation

## Automatic Processing

Once activated:

1. Every new contact triggers the webhook immediately
2. Contact is enriched within seconds
3. HubSpot record is updated automatically
4. Process repeats for each new contact

## Manual Testing

To test the workflow:

1. Use the pinned test data in the HubSpot Trigger node, or
2. Create a test contact in HubSpot
3. Monitor the execution in n8n
4. Verify the contact was updated in HubSpot

## Monitoring Performance

Track workflow health:

1. Go to **Executions** in n8n
2. Filter by this workflow
3. Monitor success rates
4. Review any failed executions
5. Check webhook delivery in HubSpot

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

**Webhook not triggering**

* Verify webhook subscription is active in HubSpot
* Check the webhook URL is correct and accessible
* Ensure workflow is activated in n8n
* Test webhook delivery in HubSpot developers portal

**Contacts not matching**

* Verify contact has firstname, lastname, and company
* Check for typos or abbreviations in company names
* Some individuals may not be in Explorium's database
* Email matching improves accuracy significantly

**Updates failing in HubSpot**

* Check API token has contact write permissions
* Verify property names exist in HubSpot
* Ensure rate limits haven't been exceeded
* Check for validation rules on properties

**Missing enrichment data**

* Not all prospects have all data types
* Phone numbers may be less available than emails
* Profile enrichment is optional and may not always return data

## Error Handling

Built-in error resilience:

* Failed matches don't block other contacts
* Each batch processes independently
* Partial enrichment is possible
* All errors are logged for review

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check webhook logs**: HubSpot shows delivery attempts
2. **Review executions**: n8n logs show detailed error messages
3. **Test with pinned data**: Use the sample data for isolated testing
4. **Verify API responses**: Check Explorium API returns expected data

# Best Practices

## Data Quality

1. **Complete contact records**: Ensure name and company are populated
2. **Standardize company names**: Use official names, not abbreviations
3. **Include existing emails**: Improves match accuracy
4. **Regular data hygiene**: Clean up test and invalid contacts

## Performance Optimization

1. **Batch size**: 6 is optimal for rate limits
2. **Webhook reliability**: Monitor delivery success
3. **API quotas**: Track usage in both platforms
4. **Execution history**: Regularly clean old executions

## Compliance & Privacy

1. **GDPR compliance**: Ensure lawful basis for enrichment
2. **Data minimization**: Only enrich necessary fields
3. **Access controls**: Limit who can modify enriched data
4. **Audit trail**: Document enrichment for compliance

# Customization Options

## Additional Enrichment

Extend with more Explorium data:

* Job titles and departments
* Social media profiles
* Professional experience
* Skills and interests
* Company information

## Enhanced Processing

Add workflow logic for:

* Lead scoring based on enrichment
* Routing based on data quality
* Notifications for high-value matches
* Custom field mapping

## Integration Extensions

Connect to other systems:

* Sync enriched data to CRM
* Trigger marketing automation
* Update data warehouse
* Send notifications to Slack

# API Considerations

## HubSpot Limits

* **API calls**: Monitor daily limits
* **Webhook payload**: Max 200 contacts per trigger
* **Rate limits**: 100 requests per 10 seconds
* **Property limits**: Max 1000 custom properties

## Explorium Limits

* **Match API**: Batched for efficiency
* **Enrichment calls**: Two parallel enrichments
* **Rate limits**: Based on your plan
* **Data freshness**: Real-time matching

# Architecture Considerations

This workflow integrates with:

* HubSpot workflows and automation
* Marketing campaigns and sequences
* Sales engagement tools
* Reporting and analytics

# Security Best Practices

* **Webhook validation**: Verify requests are from HubSpot
* **Token security**: Rotate API tokens regularly
* **Access control**: Limit workflow modifications
* **Data encryption**: All API calls use HTTPS
* **Audit logging**: Track all enrichments

# Advanced Configuration

## Custom Field Mapping

Modify the Update HubSpot node to map to custom properties:

```javascript
// Example custom mapping
{
  "custom_mobile": "{{ $json.data.mobile_phone }}",
  "custom_linkedin": "{{ $json.data.linkedin_url }}",
  "enrichment_date": "{{ $now.toISO() }}"
}
```

## Conditional Processing

Add logic to process only certain contacts:

* Filter by contact source
* Check for specific properties
* Validate email domains
* Exclude test contacts

# Support Resources
