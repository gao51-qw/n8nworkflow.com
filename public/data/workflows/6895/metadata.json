  "description": "This template uses VAPI and Cal.com to book appointments through a voice conversation. It detects whether the user wants to check availability or book an appointment, then responds naturally with real-time scheduling options.\n\nWho is this for?\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\nVoice assistant developers\n\nAI receptionists and smart concierge tools\n\nService providers (salons, clinics, coaches) needing hands-free scheduling\n\nAnyone building voice-based customer experiences\n\nWhat does it do?\nThis workflow turns a natural voice conversation into a working appointment system.\n\nIt starts with a Webhook connected to your VAPI voice agent.\n\nThe Set node extracts user intent (like “check availability” or “book now”).\n\nA Switch node branches logic based on the intent.\n\nIf the user wants to check availability, the workflow fetches available times from Cal.com.\n\nIf the user wants to book, it creates a new event using Cal.com's API.\n\nThe final result is sent back to VAPI as a conversational voice response.\n\nHow to use it\nImport this workflow into your n8n instance.\n\nSet up a Webhook node and connect it to your VAPI voice agent.\n\nAdd your Cal.com API token as a credential (use HTTP Header Auth).\n\nDeploy and test using VAPI’s simulator or real phone input.\n\n(Optional) Customize the OpenAI prompt if you're using it to process or moderate inputs.\n\nRequirements\nA working VAPI agent\n\nA Cal.com account with API access\n\nn8n (cloud or self-hosted)\n\nAn understanding of how to configure webhook and API credentials in n8n\n\nCustomization Ideas\nSwap out Cal.com with another booking API (like Calendly)\n\nAdd a Google Sheets or Supabase node to log appointments\n\nUse OpenAI to summarize or sanitize voice inputs before proceeding\n\nBuild multi-turn conversations in VAPI for more complex bookings\n![Screenshot 20250802 at 20.55.48.png](fileId:1932)",
