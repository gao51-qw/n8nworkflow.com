  "description": "## Import Forex Factory Calendar To Google Calendar\n### Purpose of this n8n Template\n1. Import Forex Factory Calendar events into Google Calendar.\n2. Delete past Forex Factory Calendar events from Google Calendar.\n\n### Use Cases:\n* Get reminders for important economic data releases — especially High Impact news.\n* Use as a trigger for opening trading positions.\n\n### How It Works (Adding Next Week’s Events to Google Calendar)\n* Every Sunday, the workflow fetches the next week’s events (.ics file) using the HTTP node.\n* The file is parsed with the Extract From File node.\n* Events are split using the Split Out node so each event is processed separately.\n* Events are classified into three categories — High, Medium, and Low Impact — using the Switch node.\n* High Impact news is added to Google Calendar with a popup reminder set 30 minutes before release.\n* Medium Impact news is added to Google Calendar without a reminder.\n* Low Impact news is ignored.\n\n### How It Works (Deleting Past Events from Google Calendar)\n* The workflow retrieves events from the past 10 days using the Google Calendar node.\n* If an event is related to Forex Factory, it will be deleted.\n* If it is not related, it will be left untouched.\n\n### How to Use\n* Enter your credentials for all Google Calendar nodes.\n\n### Requirements\n* A valid Google Calendar credential.\n\n### Need Help?\nJoin the [Discord](https://discord.gg/n8n) or ask in the [Forum](https://community.n8n.io/)!\n\nThank you!",
