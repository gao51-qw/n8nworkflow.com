## Overview
This n8n automation template allows marketers, branding teams, and creative professionals to auto-generate, evaluate, and iteratively optimize brand stories using Ollama-hosted LLMs and LangChain agents. Each story is refined until it meets quality criteria and is then saved to Google Sheets for publishing or reuse.

⚠️ Note: This template uses community nodes and requires a self-hosted n8n instance with LangChain and Ollama integrations.
