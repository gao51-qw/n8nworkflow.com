  "title": "Process Shopify new orders with Zoho CRM and Harvest",
  "description": "This workflow is triggered when a new order is created in Shopify. Then:\n- the order information is stored in Zoho CRM,\n- an invoice is created in Harvest and stored in Trello,\n- if the order value is above 50, an email with a discount coupon is sent to the customer and they are added to a MailChimp campaign for high-value customers; otherwise, only a \"thank you\" email is sent to the customer.\n\nNote that you need to replace the *List ID* in the *Trello node* with your own ID (see [instructions in our docs](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.trello/#example-usage)). Same goes for the *Account ID* in the *Harvest node* (see [instructions here](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/harvest/#using-access-token)).",
