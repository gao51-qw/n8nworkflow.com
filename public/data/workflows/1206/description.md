This workflow is triggered when a new order is created in Shopify. Then:
- the order information is stored in Zoho CRM,
- an invoice is created in Harvest and stored in Trello,
- if the order value is above 50, an email with a discount coupon is sent to the customer and they are added to a MailChimp campaign for high-value customers; otherwise, only a "thank you" email is sent to the customer.

Note that you need to replace the *List ID* in the *Trello node* with your own ID (see [instructions in our docs](https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.trello/#example-usage)). Same goes for the *Account ID* in the *Harvest node* (see [instructions here](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/harvest/#using-access-token)).
