It is not available in n8n cloud.\n* The LLM subnode can only be attached to non-\"AI agent\" nodes; Basic LLM node, Information Extractor, Question & Answer Chain, Sentiment Analysis, Summarization Chain and Text Classifier.\n\n### Requirements\n* Self-hosted version of n8n \n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Google Sheets to store usage metadata\n\n### Customising this template\n* Bring the custom LLM subnode into your own templates! In many cases, it can be a drop-in replacement for the regular OpenAI subnode.\n* Not using Google Sheets? Try other databases or a HTTP call to pipe into your CRM.",
