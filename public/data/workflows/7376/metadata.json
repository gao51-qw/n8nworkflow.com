  "description": "# Autonomous YouTube - Blog Builder / SEO Autopublisher (Sheets, ChatGPT, Apify, Pexels, WordPress) – Multilanguage\n\n**100% autonomous** workflow that transforms **YouTube videos** into **unique, high-quality, SEO-optimized blog articles** and automatically publishes them to WordPress. No human intervention required: it uses **YouTube as the main source** for fresh, original content ideas, manages a **keyword bank in Google Sheets**, finds relevant videos via **Apify**, **transcribes**, **writes**, **formats**, selects a **featured image** via Pexels, generates **SEO metadata**, and **publishes**.\nWhen all keywords are used, it will **automatically generate new ones** (avoiding duplicates) to keep producing content without interruptions.\n\n**Estimated cost per post** (including ChatGPT + Apify (free 5$ new user)) → **\\$0.01 – \\$0.03** depending on video length.\n\nIncludes:\n\n* **Access to APIs with 7-day free trials** (Apify, Pexels, etc.).\n* **Step-by-step documentation** to get each API key.\n* **Basic setup support** to get you started.\n\n## Who it’s for\n\n* Agencies and creators looking to **scale blogging** from video content.\n* SEO teams needing **automation with quality control**.\n* Technical bloggers who want **hands-off publishing** with tracking.\n\n## SEO\n* SEO teams needing **automation with quality control (modifiable from the options node like including h1, hierarchy among other SEO options)**.\n* The title and description of the page (SEO) is based on the language in which the blog was created\n* Allows you to add keywords\n\n## How it works (phase summary)\n\n**Part 1 – Keyword initialization**\n\n* Manual or scheduled trigger.\n* Checks if the Google Sheet is empty; if so, **generates 10 keywords** based on a seed idea and saves them.\n\n**Part 2 – Keyword management & blog settings**\n\n* Includes an **“options” node** to configure global blog language and formatting rules (H1, headings, bold, intro, conclusion, etc.).\n* Selects a keyword with `false` status (unused), marks it `true` with a **usage date**, and if none are left, **generates new ones** while avoiding duplicates.\n\n**Part 3 – Video search & duplicate filtering**\n\n* Searches YouTube via **Apify** using the keyword, retrieves \\~30 results, **excludes Shorts**, and selects **2 videos** based on title/description/hashtags.\n* Checks for duplicates; if found, **retries up to 5 times** with variations.\n* If still duplicated, discards the keyword and selects another.\n\n## Error Handling & Continuity\n\nIncludes **fallbacks and failure alerts in every critical node** to ensure the workflow keeps running even if a step fails.\n\n**Part 4 – Article creation**\n\n1. **Transcribes** the video (cost included in \\$0.01–\\$0.03).\n2. ChatGPT writes a formal blog post in the **language set** in the “options” node.\n3. A second ChatGPT step applies the formatting rules (structure, H1/H2…, intro/conclusion).\n4. Ensures **SEO compliance**.\n5. Converts **Markdown → HTML** and **publishes** to WordPress (more info results screenshots).\n\n**Part 5 – Image & final publishing**\n\n* Searches **Pexels API** for images using the post keyword.\n* ChatGPT chooses the most suitable image; it’s **downloaded and attached** to the post.\n* Generates an SEO **title** and **meta description** based on the content.\n* Sends an **email confirmation** with the published URL (with the chosen language, more info screenshots).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **OpenAI / ChatGPT** (or compatible provider for transcription and writing).\n* **Google Sheets** (keyword storage and usage tracking).\n* **Apify** (YouTube search (free 5$ new user)).\n* **Pexels API** (image sourcing (free api)).\n* **WordPress REST API** (user with permissions to create posts/media).\n\n## Costs & limits (important)\n\n* **Cost per post:** **\\$0.01 – \\$0.03** (ChatGPT + Apify included (free 5$ new user)).\n* **Rate limits**: respect YouTube/Apify, Pexels, and OpenAI limits.\n\n## Thoroughly Tested for Reliability and Performance\n\n* This workflow has been **carefully tested in multiple scenarios** to ensure optimal functionality, stability, and accuracy.\n* Various edge cases and potential failure points were simulated, and fallback mechanisms were implemented to handle unexpected situations.\n* The result is a **robust and reliable automation** you can run confidently in production environments.\n\nThe workflow is multi-language and it has been tested to create blogs in (Russian, Spanish, English, German and French) all the results were verified and good\n\n## Screenshots\n\n- [Is it really autonomous?](https://i.ibb.co/HLbrHmhq/Screenshot-20250811-193829-Chrome.jpg)  \n- [Blog example (Eng) – P1](https://i.ibb.co/T914gbr/example-blog-eng-lang.jpg)  \n- [Blog example (Eng) – P2](https://i.ibb.co/vvDpS1CV/example-blog-eng-lang-2.jpg)  \n- [Blog example (IT)](https://i.ibb.co/zhzHFjHn/example-blog-it-lang.jpg)  \n- [Email received](https://i.ibb.co/przyrwQz/blog-created-email.jpg)  \n\n**More info and photos:** [oriolrotllant3@gmail.com](mailto:oriolrotllant3@gmail.com)\n",
