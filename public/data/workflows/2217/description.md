How it works:
Webhook URL that responds to Requests with an AI generated Image based on the prompt provided in the URL.


Setup Steps:
- Ideate your prompt
- URL Encode The Prompt (as shown in the Template)
- Authenticate with your OpenAI Credentials
- Put together the Webhook URL with your prompt and enter into a webbrowser

In this way you can expose a public url to users, employee's etc. without exposing your OpenAI API Key to them.
