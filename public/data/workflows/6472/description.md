1. **Fetches all House bills** scheduled for the week.
2. **Cleans and downloads bill PDFs.**
3. **Analyzes each bill with Gemini** (relevance, urgency, stance, key action points).
4. **Filters irrelevant bills** using built-in thresholds.
5. **Runs a research subworkflow** for lobbying, sponsor, and coalition intel.
6. **Generates a ready-to-send HTML action email** with scripts, contacts, and deadlines.

2. **Download & import** the [Research Subworkflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/5588-multi-tool-research-agent-for-animal-advocacy-with-openrouter-serper-and-open-paws-db/) and select it in the “Research” node.
3. **Add email credentials** (SMTP, Gmail, etc.) in the Email node.
4. (Optional) **Adjust Gemini prompt or thresholds** for your priorities.
