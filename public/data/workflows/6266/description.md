This automated n8n workflow detects and manages fraudulent booking transactions through comprehensive AI-powered analysis and multi-layered security checks. The system processes incoming travel booking data, performs IP geolocation verification, enriches transaction details with AI insights, calculates dynamic risk scores, and executes automated responses based on threat levels. All transactions are logged and appropriate notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders.

## **Good to Know**

* The workflow combines multiple detection methods, including IP geolocation, AI analysis, and risk scoring algorithms
* Google Gemini Chat Model provides advanced natural language processing for transaction analysis
* Risk levels are dynamically calculated and categorized as CRITICAL, HIGH, or standard risk
* Automated blocking and flagging system protects against fraudulent transactions in real-time
* All transaction data is logged to Google Sheets for audit trails and pattern analysis
* The system respects API rate limits and includes proper error handling mechanisms

## **How It Works**

**1. Initial Data Ingestion & Extraction**
- Monitors and captures incoming booking transaction data from various sources
- Extracts key booking details including user information, payment data, booking location, and transaction metadata
- Performs initial data validation and formatting for downstream processing

**2. IP Geolocation and AI Analysis**
- **IP Geolocation Check**: Validates booking IP addresses by checking geolocation details and comparing against expected user locations
- **AI Agent Integration**: Utilizes Google Gemini Chat Model to analyze booking patterns, user behavior, and transaction anomalies
- **Enhanced Data Processing**: Enriches transaction data with geographical context and AI-driven risk indicators

**3. Risk Calculation and Decision Logic**
- **Enhanced Risk Calculator**: Combines AI-generated risk scores with geolocation-based factors, payment method analysis, and historical patterns
- **Critical Risk Check**: Flags transactions with risk levels marked as CRITICAL for immediate action
- **High Risk Check**: Identifies HIGH risk transactions requiring additional verification steps
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Adjusts risk calculations based on real-time threat intelligence and pattern recognition

**4. Action & Notification**
- **Block User Account**: Automatically blocks user accounts for CRITICAL risk transactions to prevent immediate fraud
- **Flag for Review**: Marks HIGH risk transactions for manual review by fraud prevention teams
- **Send Notifications**: Dispatches real-time alerts via email and messaging systems to security teams
- **Automated Responses**: Sends appropriate messages to users based on transaction status and risk level

**5. Logging & Response**
- **Log to Google Sheets**: Records all transaction details, risk scores, and actions taken for comprehensive audit trails
- **Flag for Review**: Maintains detailed logs of flagged transactions for pattern analysis and machine learning improvements
- **Response Tracking**: Monitors and logs all automated responses and manual interventions
