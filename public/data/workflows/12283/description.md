## How It Works
This workflow automates brand reputation monitoring by analyzing sentiment across news, social media, reviews, and forums using AI-powered trend detection. Designed for PR teams, brand managers, marketing directors, and crisis communication specialists requiring real-time awareness of reputation threats before they escalate.The template solves the challenge of manually tracking brand mentions across fragmented channels—news outlets, Twitter, Instagram, review sites, Reddit, industry forums—then identifying emerging crises hidden in sentiment shifts and volume spikes.Scheduled execution triggers four parallel HTTP nodes fetching data from news APIs, social media monitoring services, review aggregators, and forum discussion platforms. Merge node combines all sources, then normalization ensures consistent data structure.
