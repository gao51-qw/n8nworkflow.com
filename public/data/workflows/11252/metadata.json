  "description": "What it is\nAn automated LinkedIn content system that takes a simple form (idea + optional file), generates LinkedIn posts with OpenAI, stores them in Notion, builds Google Slides carousels, and auto-publishes posts (text, image, or document) to LinkedIn on a schedule while keeping Notion in sync.\n\nSetup steps\n\n1. Connect integrations: link your Notion database, LinkedIn account, Google Drive/Slides, OpenAI, and Gmail in n8n.\n\n2. Configure the form: set up the “LinkedIn Post Generator” form with the idea field and optional file upload.\n\n3. Map AI outputs: wire the OpenAI nodes so they write post title, funnel stage, and content into your Notion “LinkedIn Auto Posts” database.\n\n4. Enable carousel flow: connect Notion → OpenAI → Google Slides template → Google Drive copy → Notion update for “Create Carousel” items.\n\n5. Set scheduling: use the Schedule Trigger + Notion filters (“Ready for Post” + Scheduled Date) to pick which posts go out each hour.\n\n6. Publish & track: send posts to LinkedIn (text, image, or document), then update Notion status to “Posted” and, if needed, send yourself an email reminder for manual carousel actions.",
