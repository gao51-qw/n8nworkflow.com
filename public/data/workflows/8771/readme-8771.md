# Automated workflow backup system with Google Drive, GitHub & messaging alerts

> ## Why You Need This Right Now 💡

**Stop the panic attacks.** We've all been there - accidentally deleted a workflow that took hours to build, or worse, corrupted your entire automation setup. This workflow is your safety net.

**Save your weekends.** Instead of spending hours recreating lost work, get back to what matters. One setup protects everything, automatically.

**Sleep better at night.** Your workflows are safely stored in two places with full version history. If something breaks, you're back online in minutes, not days.

## Perfect For These Situations ⚡

✅ **Business owners** running critical automations  
✅ **Agencies** managing client workflows  
✅ **Teams** who need audit trails  
✅ **Anyone** who values their time and sanity  

## How It Actually Works 🔧

Think of it like having a personal assistant who:

1. **Checks your workflows** twice daily (you can change this)
2. **Creates organized backups** with timestamps 
3. **Stores them safely** in Google Drive AND GitHub
4. **Tells you it's done** via Telegram or Discord
5. **Keeps everything tidy** with smart folder organization

**The result?** A timestamped folder in your Google Drive and organized files in your GitHub repo. Everything is searchable, restorable, and audit-ready.

## Quick 5-Minute Setup 🚀

1. **Import** this workflow to your n8n
2. **Connect your accounts** (Google Drive, GitHub, optional notifications)
3. **Set your preferences** (which folder, which repo, how often)
4. **Test it once** to make sure everything works
5. **Relax** knowing your workflows are protected

## What You'll Need 📋

- Your n8n instance (obviously!)
- Google Drive account (free works fine)
- GitHub account (free works too)
- 5 minutes of setup time
- Optional: Telegram or Discord for notifications
