  "description": "## Inventory Low Stock Alerts\n**E-commerce Automation**\nThis n8n template automatically monitors your Shopify inventory levels and sends alerts when products fall below your defined threshold. Prevent stockouts and maintain sales revenue with proactive inventory management.\nGood to know\n\nDefault threshold is 10 units but easily customizable in the Code node\nMonitors all product variants individually\nRuns daily at 9 AM but schedule is fully adjustable\nOnly sends alerts when action is needed (no empty notifications)\n\n## How it works\n\nThe schedule runs daily at 9 AM and connects to Shopify to download all products and variants. The workflow loops through every product and variant, checking inventory quantity for each item. It compares current stock against your threshold (default: 10 units) and identifies items below threshold. If any low stock items are found, it creates a comprehensive list and formats an alert message. The formatted report is sent to your Slack team so they can take immediate restocking action.\n\n## Set up instructions\n\nSet up Shopify credentials in n8n: API Key, Password, Shop Subdomain, and Shared Secret\nThe schedule trigger runs daily at 9 AM but feel free to adjust timing based on your business needs\n\nModify \"lowStockThreshold\" variable in the Code node (default is set to 10 units)\nSet up Slack credentials and create a dedicated #inventory channel for alerts\nEnsure your Shopify products have inventory tracking enabled in product settings\n\nTest the workflow manually to verify it correctly identifies low-stock items\n\n## What team sees:\n\"🚨 Low Stock Alert!\n\nT-Shirt Blue (Medium): 3 left\nCoffee Mug (White): 7 left\nPhone Case (Black): 2 left\"\n\n**Business logic**:\nStock above threshold equals no alert. Stock at or below threshold equals alert sent. Stock at zero equals out of stock which is critical.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\nAdd email alerts for critical out-of-stock items\nSet different thresholds for different product categories\nInclude supplier contact information in alerts\n\n\n\n",
