# How it works

The workflow supports three input methods and automatically processes LinkedIn profiles via Apify scraper. When you provide LinkedIn URLs through Google Sheets, manual trigger, or webhook, the system extracts complete profile data including name, company, position, and connections. It then generates multiple email pattern variations and calculates lead scores based on authority indicators like job title, connection count, and location. All processed data is automatically added to your Google Sheets CRM with lead quality ratings and email guesses ready for outreach.

**Input Sources:** Google Sheets monitoring, manual trigger, or webhook API  
**Processing:** Apify LinkedIn scraper + intelligent data enrichment  
**Output:** Complete CRM-ready lead profiles with email intelligence  
**Timing:** Real-time processing or batch every 5 minutes
