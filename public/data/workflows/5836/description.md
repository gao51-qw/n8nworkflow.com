**What is DIGIPIN?**
DIGIPIN (Digital Pincode) is a 10-character alphanumeric code introduced by India Post. It maps any 3x3 meter square in India to a unique digital address. This helps precisely locate homes, shops, or landmarks, especially in areas where physical addresses are inconsistent or missing.

**What this workflow does**
This workflow creates a fully offline DIGIPIN microservice using only JavaScript - no external APIs are used.

You get two HTTP endpoints:
- GET /generate-digipin?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude} → returns a DIGIPIN
- GET /decode-digipin?digipin={code} → returns the latitude and longitude

You can plug this into any system to:
- Convert GPS coordinates to a DIGIPIN
- Convert a DIGIPIN back to coordinates

**How it works**
1. An HTTP Webhook node receives the request
2. A JS Function node either encodes or decodes based on input
3. The result is returned as a JSON response

All the logic is handled inside the workflow - no API keys, no external calls.

**Why use this**
- Fast and lightweight
- Easily extendable: you can connect this to forms, CRMs, apps, or spreadsheets
- Ideal for field agents, address validation, logistics, or rural operations
