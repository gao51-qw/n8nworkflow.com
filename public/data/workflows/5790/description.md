*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

**This n8n template automates candidate outreach, call transcription, and structured feedback capture for HR teams and recruiters. It triggers on a new candidate row added in a Google Sheet, initiates a call using Vapi.ai, processes the transcript using Google Gemini, extracts key information like CTC, experience, and notice period, and then updates the same Google Sheet with parsed insights.

This is ideal for recruiters or HR teams conducting high-volume candidate outreach and wanting to scale initial data collection using automated voice bots and AI transcription analysis.**

## How it works
1. Trigger: Listens for new rows added to a Google Sheet (e.g., a new candidate lead).

2. Call Initiation: Uses Vapi.ai to make a phone call to the candidate using an assistant bot.

3. Transcript Retrieval: After the call, fetches the conversation transcript from the Vapi API.

4. AI Transcript Analysis: Google Gemini parses the transcript and extracts structured fields like:
- Work experience
- Current & expected CTC
- Notice period & negotiability
- Work preferences and location
 
5. Data Mapping: Extracted insights are mapped to structured JSON fields.
 
6. Google Sheet Update: The same row in the source Sheet is updated with the collected information.
