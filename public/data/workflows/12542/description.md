This workflow automates the creation of **AI-generated viral selfie images with celebrities** using **Nano Banana Pro Edit** via [RunPod](https://get.runpod.io/n3witalia), generates engaging social media captions, and publishes the content to **Instagram** via [Postiz](https://affiliate.postiz.com/n3witalia). It starts with a form submission where the user provides an image URL, a custom prompt, and an aspect ratio.

### How it works
The workflow then:

1. Sends the image and prompt to RunPod’s Nano Banana Pro Edit API for AI image generation.
2. Periodically checks the generation status until it is completed.
3. Once the image is ready, it is downloaded and analyzed by Google Gemini to generate a viral-ready Instagram caption and hashtags.
4. The final image is uploaded to Google Drive and to Postiz for social media publishing.
5. The caption and image are combined and scheduled for posting on Instagram through the Postiz integration.

The process includes conditional logic, waiting intervals, and error handling to ensure reliable execution from input to publication.

### Set up steps
To use this workflow in n8n:

1. **Configure credentials**:
   - Add [RunPod API](https://get.runpod.io/n3witalia) credentials under `httpBearerAuth` named “Runpods”.
   - Set up Google Gemini (PaLM) API credentials for caption generation.
   - Add [Postiz API](https://affiliate.postiz.com/n3witalia) credentials for social media posting.
   - Configure Google Drive OAuth2 credentials for image backup.

2. **Prepare nodes**:
   - Ensure the Form Trigger node is properly set up with the required fields: `IMAGE_URL`, `PROMPT`, and `FORMAT`.
   - Update the RunPod API endpoints in the “Generate selfie” and “Get status clip” nodes if needed.
   - Verify the Google Drive folder ID in the “Upload file” node.
   - Replace `XXX` in the “Upload to Social” node with a valid Postiz integration ID.

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Use the pinned test data in the “On form submission” node to simulate a form entry.
   - Activate the workflow and submit the form to trigger the process.
   - Monitor execution in n8n’s workflow view to ensure all nodes run successfully.
