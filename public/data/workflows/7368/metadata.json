  "description": "## **Web Consultation & Crawling Chatbot with Google Sheets Memory**\n\n**Who is this workflow for?**\nThis workflow is designed for **SEO analysts, content creators, marketing agencies, and developers** who need to index a website and then interact with its content as if it were a chatbot.\n⚠ **Note:** if the site contains many pages, AI token consumption can generate **high costs**, especially during the initial crawling and analysis phase.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Initial Mode (first use with a URL)**\n\nWhen the user enters a URL for the first time:\n\n1. **URL validation** using AI (gpt-5-nano).\n2. **Automatic sitemap discovery** via `robots.txt`.\n3. **Relevant sitemap selection** (pages, posts, categories, or tags) using GPT-4o according to configured options.\n   *(Includes “OPTIONS” node to precisely choose which types of URLs to process)*\n4. **Crawling of all selected pages**:\n\n   * Downloads HTML of each page.\n   * Converts HTML to Markdown.\n   * AI analysis to extract:\n\n     * Detected language.\n     * Heading hierarchy (H1, H2, etc.).\n     * Internal and external links.\n     * Content summary.\n5. **Structured storage** in Google Sheets:\n\n   * Lang\n   * H1 and hierarchy\n   * External URLs\n   * Internal URLs\n   * Summary Content\n   * Data schema (flag to enable agent mode)\n\nWhen finished, the sheet is marked with **`Data schema = true`**, signaling that the site is indexed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Agent Mode (subsequent queries)**\n\nIf the URL has already been indexed (`Data schema = true`):\n\n1. The chat becomes a **LangChain Agent** that:\n\n   * Reads the database in Google Sheets.\n   * Can perform **real-time HTTP requests** if it needs updated information.\n   * Responds **as if it were the website**, using stored and live data.\n\nThis allows the user to ask questions such as:\n\n* *\"What’s on the contact page?\"*\n* *\"How many external links are there on the homepage?\"*\n* *\"Give me all the H1 headings from the services pages\"*\n* *\"What CTA would you suggest for my page?\"*\n* *\"How would you expand X content?\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Use cases**\n\n* Build a chatbot that answers questions about a website’s content.\n* Index and analyze full websites for future queries.\n* SEO tool to list headings, links, and content summaries.\n* Assistant for quick exploration of a site’s structure.\n* Generate improvement recommendations and content strategies from site data.\n",
