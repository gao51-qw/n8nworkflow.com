## How it works

- Fetch all workflows from your n8n instance.
- Filter workflows that contain nodes with a `modelId` setting.
- Extract the node names, model IDs, model names, workflow names, and workflow URLs.
- Save the extracted information into a connected **Google Sheet**.

# Set up steps

1. Connect your **n8n API** credentials.
2. Connect your **Google Sheets** account.
3. Replace `"Your n8n domain"` with your actual domain URL.
4. Use this [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vl_Xj9QLGE04XMimmJzj1V0vJgP3j18duhsIziVNx_A/copy) to create a new sheet for results.
5. Setup typically takes **5 minutes**.
6. Be cautious: if you have over 100 workflows, performance may be impacted.

## Notes

- Sticky notes inside the workflow provide extra guidance.
- This workflow clears old sheet data before writing new results.
- Make sure your n8n instance allows API access.
