  "description": "## How it works\n\n- Fetch all workflows from your n8n instance.\n- Filter workflows that contain nodes with a `modelId` setting.\n- Extract the node names, model IDs, model names, workflow names, and workflow URLs.\n- Save the extracted information into a connected **Google Sheet**.\n\n# Set up steps\n\n1. Connect your **n8n API** credentials.\n2. Connect your **Google Sheets** account.\n3. Replace `\"Your n8n domain\"` with your actual domain URL.\n4. Use this [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vl_Xj9QLGE04XMimmJzj1V0vJgP3j18duhsIziVNx_A/copy) to create a new sheet for results.\n5. Setup typically takes **5 minutes**.\n6. Be cautious: if you have over 100 workflows, performance may be impacted.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Sticky notes inside the workflow provide extra guidance.\n- This workflow clears old sheet data before writing new results.\n- Make sure your n8n instance allows API access.\n\n## Result Example\n![Screenshot_20250426_215018_VOGw3C702x.jpg](fileId:1168)\n\nUpdate:\nIt didn't detect the AI model in tool originally. Now it's fixed!\n\nUpdate 20250429:\nSupport 1.91.0 with open node directly!\nOptimize the url with node id.",
