    "description": "## Overview\nThis workflow automates LinkedIn posts using OpenAI. The prompts are stored in the workflow and can be customized as needed to fit your needs. The workflow uses a combination of a Schedule Trigger, some code that determines what day of the week it is (no posting Friday - Sunday), a prompts node to set your OpenAI prompts, a random selection of a prompt so that you are not generating content that looks repetitive. We send that all to OpenAI API, select a random time, have the final LinkedIn post sent to your Telegram for approval, once approved wait for the correct time slot, and then Post to your LinkedIn account using the LinkedIn node.\n\n## How it works:\n\nRun or schedule the workflow in n8n\nThe automation can be triggered manually or on a custom schedule (excluding weekends if needed).\n\nYou should customize the prompts in the Prompt Node to suit your needs.\n\nA random LinkedIn post prompt is selected\nPre-written prompts are rotated to keep content fresh and non-repetitive.\n\nOpenAI generates the LinkedIn post\nThe prompt is sent to OpenAI via API, and the result is returned in clean, ready-to-use form.\n\nYou receive the draft via Telegram.\nThe post is sent to Telegram for quick approval or review.\n\nPost is scheduled or published via the LinkedIn Connector\n\nOnce approved, the workflow delays until the target time, then sends the content to LinkedIn.\n\n## What's needed:\nAn OpenAPI API key, LinkedIn Account, and a Telegram Account.\n\n## For Telegram you will need to configure the Bot service.\n\nStep-by-Step: Telegram Approval for Your Workflow\nA. Set Up a Telegram Bot\n\t1. Open Telegram and search for “@BotFather”.\n\t2. Start a chat and type /newbot to create a bot.\n\t3. Give your bot a name and a unique username (e.g., YourApprovalBot).\n\t4. Copy the API token that BotFather gives you.\n\nB. Add Your Bot to a Private Chat (with You)\n- Find your bot in Telegram, click “Start” to activate it.\n- Send a test message (like “hello”) so the chat is created.\n\nC. Get Your User ID\n- Search for “userinfobot” or use sites like userinfobot in Telegram.\nType /start and it will reply with your Telegram user ID.\n\n## OpenAI powers the LinkedIn post creation\n\n1.  **Add Your OpenAI API Key**:\n    * Log in to your OpenAI Platform account: **`https://platform.openai.com/`**.\n    * Go to **API keys** and create a new secret key.\n    * In n8n, create a new **\"OpenAI API\"** credential and paste your API key. Give it a name.\n2.  **Apply Credential to Nodes**: OpenAI Message Node\n\n## Connect your LinkedIn account to the Linked in Node\n1.\tSelect your account from the LinkedIn Dropdown box.\n",
