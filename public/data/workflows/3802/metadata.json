  "description": "# Receive realtime call-event data from telli\n\n### Purpose and Problem Solved\n\nThis template automates the process of receiving and acting upon real-time call event data from telli, an AI-powered voice agent platform. It solves the challenge of manually updating CRM records and initiating follow-up actions based on call outcomes. By leveraging webhooks and n8n's powerful workflow capabilities, this template enables businesses to instantly update their Airtable CRM and trigger appropriate follow-up actions, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness in customer interactions.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- An active telli account with API access and webhook capabilities\n- An Airtable base set up as your CRM\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n\n### Airtable Specifications\n\nCreate an Airtable base with the following table and fields:\n\n**Table: Contacts**\n- Fields:\n  - Name (Single line text)\n  - Phone (Phone number)\n  - Email (Email)\n  - Appointment_Booked (Checkbox)\n  - Interest (Single select: High, Medium, Low)\n  - Last_Call_Date (Date)\n  - Notes (Long text)\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Webhook Configuration in telli:**\n   - Log into your telli dashboard\n   - Navigate to the webhook settings\n   - Set the endpoint URL to your n8n Webhook node URL\n   - Select the \"call_ended\" event to trigger the webhook\n\n2. **n8n Workflow Setup:**\n   - Create a new workflow in n8n\n   - Add a Webhook node as the trigger\n   - Configure the Webhook node to receive POST requests\n\n3. **Parse Webhook Data:**\n   - Add a Set node to extract relevant information from the webhook payload\n   - Map fields such as call_outcome, appointment_booked, and interest\n\n4. **Decision Logic:**\n   - Add a Switch node to create different paths based on the call outcome\n   - Create branches for scenarios like \"Appointment Booked\", \"Interested\", and \"Not Interested\"\n\n5. **Airtable Integration:**\n   - Add Airtable nodes for each outcome to update the Contacts table\n   - Configure the nodes to update fields like Appointment_Booked, Interest, and Last_Call_Date\n\n6. **Follow-up Actions:**\n   - For \"Interested\" but not booked outcomes, add an Email node to trigger a follow-up email campaign\n   - For \"Appointment Booked\", add a node to create a calendar event or task\n\n7. **Testing and Activation:**\n   - Use the n8n testing feature to simulate webhook calls and verify each path\n   - Once satisfied, activate the workflow\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n1. Webhook receives a \"call_ended\" event from telli\n2. Set node extracts call_outcome: appointment_booked = true, interest = true\n3. Switch node directs to the \"Appointment Booked\" path\n4. Airtable node updates the contact record:\n   - Set Appointment_Booked to true\n   - Set Interest to \"High\"\n   - Update Last_Call_Date\n5. Calendar node creates an appointment for the booked slot\n\n### Example Payload\n\nBelow is an example of the payload you might receive from telli when a call ends:\n```json\n{\n  \"event\": \"call_ended\",\n  \"call\": {\n    \"call_id\": \"b4a05730-2abc-4eb0-8066-2e4d23b53ba9\",\n    \"attempt\": 1,\n    \"from_number\": \"+17755719467\",\n    \"to_number\": \"+16506794960\",\n    \"external_contact_id\": \"external-123\",\n    \"contact_id\": \"6bd1e7e0-6d00-4c0b-ad5b-daa72457a27d\",\n    \"agent_id\": \"d8931604-92ad-45cf-9071-d9cd2afbad0c\",\n    \"triggered_at\": 1731956924302,\n    \"started_at\": 1731956932264,\n    \"booked_slot_for\": \"2025-02-24T15:30:00Z\",\n    \"ended_at\": 1731957002078,\n    \"call_length_min\": 2,\n    \"call_status\": \"COMPLETED\",\n    \"transcript\": \"Agent: Hello...\",\n    \"transcriptObject\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"agent\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello...\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"call_analysis\": {\n      \"summary\": {\n        \"value\": true,\n        \"details\": \"A call between an agent and a customer talking about buying an ice cream machine\"\n      },\n      \"appointment\": {\n        \"value\": true,\n        \"details\": \"2025-02-18T15:30:00Z\"\n      },\n      \"interest\": {\n        \"value\": true,\n        \"details\": \"The customer is interested in buying an ice cream machine\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, you can see that the call resulted in a booked appointment and showed customer interest. Your n8n workflow would process this data, updating the Airtable CRM and triggering any necessary follow-up actions.\n\nBy implementing this template, businesses can automate their post-call processes, ensuring timely follow-ups and accurate CRM updates. This real-time integration between telli's AI voice agents and your Airtable CRM streamlines operations, improves customer engagement, and increases the efficiency of your sales and support teams.",
