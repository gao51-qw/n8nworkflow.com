  "description": "Execution video: [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/GGvJBnIZQsY?si=y-SPWiy8EFo473_s)\n\nI built an **AI voice-triggered RAG assistant** where ElevenLabs’ conversational model acts as the front end and n8n handles the brain....here’s the real breakdown of what’s happening in that workflow:\n\n1. **Webhook** (`/inf`)\n\n   * Gets hit by ElevenLabs once the user finishes talking.\n   * Payload includes `user_question`.\n\n2. **Embed User Message** (Together API - BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5)\n\n   * Turns the spoken question into a dense vector embedding.\n   * This embedding is the query representation for semantic search.\n\n3. **Search Embeddings** (Supabase RPC)\n\n   * Calls `matchembeddings1` to find the top 5 most relevant context chunks from your stored knowledge base.\n\n4. **Aggregate**\n\n   * Merges all retrieved `chunk` values into one block of text so the LLM gets full context at once.\n\n5. **Basic LLM Chain** (LangChain node)\n\n   * Prompt forces the model to only answer from the retrieved context and to sound human-like without saying “based on the context”....\n   * Uses **Google Vertex Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the actual model.\n\n6. **Respond to Webhook**\n\n   * Sends the generated answer back instantly to the webhook call, so ElevenLabs can speak it back.\n\nYou essentially have:\n**Voice → Text → Embedding → Vector Search → Context Injection → LLM → Response → Voice**",
