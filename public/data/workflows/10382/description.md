This n8n workflow automates airline customer support by classifying travel-related questions, fetching relevant information, generating AI answers, and delivering structured responses to users. It ensures accurate travel information delivery, tracks user satisfaction, and logs interactions for future insights — reducing manual support load and improving customer experience.

### Key Features

* Allows users to ask airline/travel questions directly through chat via webhook integration.
* Automatically classifies questions into categories like baggage, refunds, visas, bookings, and travel info.
* Fetches verified travel knowledge and generates responses using AI.
* Performs satisfaction check and offers human support if needed.
* Logs all conversations and system responses for analytics and support auditing.

### Workflow Process

* The **Webhook Entry Point** node receives passenger questions from chat/website (e.g., WhatsApp, web chat widget, or API).
* The **Data Extraction & Cleaning** node formats the user query by removing noise and structuring text.
* The **Question Categorization** node uses AI to classify the inquiry (e.g., baggage policy, cancellation rules, destination info).
* The **Category Parsing** node routes the query to the appropriate context source or knowledge logic.
* The **Knowledge Retrieval** node fetches verified travel or airline-specific information.
* The **AI Response Generator** node produces a natural, accurate customer-facing reply using the retrieved context.
* The **Response Formatting** node adds clarity, structured bullet points, links, and travel guidance tips.
* The **Satisfaction Check** node asks if the user is happy with the answer and branches:

  * If satisfied → continue to logging
  * If not satisfied → send request to human support channel
* The **Human Escalation Path** node hands unresolved queries to human support teams.
* The **Interaction Logger** node stores conversation data (question, category, AI response, feedback status) in a database.
* The **Final Delivery** node sends the formatted response back to the user chat channel.

### Setup Instructions

* Import the workflow into n8n and configure the **Webhook Entry Point** with your chat platform or airline support portal.
* Add OpenAI API credentials in the **AI Response Generator** and **Categorization** nodes.
* Set up your **Knowledge Retrieval** source (e.g., internal travel database, API, or curated knowledge file).
* Connect a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase, MongoDB) to store conversation logs and user behavior.
* Configure optional human support integration (Slack, email, CRM, or support desk tool).
* Test the workflow by sending sample airline queries (e.g., “Baggage limit to Dubai?” or “How to reschedule my flight?”).

### Prerequisites

* n8n instance with webhook, AI, and database nodes enabled.
* OpenAI API key for AI classification and response generation.
* Airline or travel knowledge source (API or internal knowledge base).
* Database connection for logging queries and satisfaction responses.
* Customer chat channel setup (WhatsApp, website widget, CRM integration, or Telegram bot).

### Modification Options

* Enhance the **Knowledge Retrieval** step to pull real-time data from flight APIs, visa APIs, or airline portals.
* Add language translation to support global passengers.
* Extend **Satisfaction Logic** to auto-escalate urgent cases (e.g., flight delays, lost baggage complaints).
* Build **self-service functions** like:

  * Flight status lookup
  * Refund eligibility checker
  * Visa requirement assistant
* Customize the **Response Formatting** to include buttons/links (e.g., check baggage rules, contact support).
