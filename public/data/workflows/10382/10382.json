    "description": "This n8n workflow automates airline customer support by classifying travel-related questions, fetching relevant information, generating AI answers, and delivering structured responses to users. It ensures accurate travel information delivery, tracks user satisfaction, and logs interactions for future insights — reducing manual support load and improving customer experience.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* Allows users to ask airline/travel questions directly through chat via webhook integration.\n* Automatically classifies questions into categories like baggage, refunds, visas, bookings, and travel info.\n* Fetches verified travel knowledge and generates responses using AI.\n* Performs satisfaction check and offers human support if needed.\n* Logs all conversations and system responses for analytics and support auditing.\n\n### Workflow Process\n\n* The **Webhook Entry Point** node receives passenger questions from chat/website (e.g., WhatsApp, web chat widget, or API).\n* The **Data Extraction & Cleaning** node formats the user query by removing noise and structuring text.\n* The **Question Categorization** node uses AI to classify the inquiry (e.g., baggage policy, cancellation rules, destination info).\n* The **Category Parsing** node routes the query to the appropriate context source or knowledge logic.\n* The **Knowledge Retrieval** node fetches verified travel or airline-specific information.\n* The **AI Response Generator** node produces a natural, accurate customer-facing reply using the retrieved context.\n* The **Response Formatting** node adds clarity, structured bullet points, links, and travel guidance tips.\n* The **Satisfaction Check** node asks if the user is happy with the answer and branches:\n\n  * If satisfied → continue to logging\n  * If not satisfied → send request to human support channel\n* The **Human Escalation Path** node hands unresolved queries to human support teams.\n* The **Interaction Logger** node stores conversation data (question, category, AI response, feedback status) in a database.\n* The **Final Delivery** node sends the formatted response back to the user chat channel.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n* Import the workflow into n8n and configure the **Webhook Entry Point** with your chat platform or airline support portal.\n* Add OpenAI API credentials in the **AI Response Generator** and **Categorization** nodes.\n* Set up your **Knowledge Retrieval** source (e.g., internal travel database, API, or curated knowledge file).\n* Connect a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase, MongoDB) to store conversation logs and user behavior.\n* Configure optional human support integration (Slack, email, CRM, or support desk tool).\n* Test the workflow by sending sample airline queries (e.g., “Baggage limit to Dubai?” or “How to reschedule my flight?”).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* n8n instance with webhook, AI, and database nodes enabled.\n* OpenAI API key for AI classification and response generation.\n* Airline or travel knowledge source (API or internal knowledge base).\n* Database connection for logging queries and satisfaction responses.\n* Customer chat channel setup (WhatsApp, website widget, CRM integration, or Telegram bot).\n\n### Modification Options\n\n* Enhance the **Knowledge Retrieval** step to pull real-time data from flight APIs, visa APIs, or airline portals.\n* Add language translation to support global passengers.\n* Extend **Satisfaction Logic** to auto-escalate urgent cases (e.g., flight delays, lost baggage complaints).\n* Build **self-service functions** like:\n\n  * Flight status lookup\n  * Refund eligibility checker\n  * Visa requirement assistant\n* Customize the **Response Formatting** to include buttons/links (e.g., check baggage rules, contact support).\n\n\n**Explore More AI Travel Workflows: [Get in touch with us](https://www.oneclickitsolution.com/contact-us/) for custom airline automation!**\n\n",
