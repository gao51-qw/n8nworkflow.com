  "description": "This workflow automates the process of reading EDI files generated by Sabre, parsing them using an AI Agent, and producing structured accounting reports like:\n\n📌 Accounts Receivable (AR) Summary\n📌 Tax and Surcharges Report\n\nIt also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to vectorize the Sabre Interface User Record (IUR)—a 154-page technical document—so that the AI agent can reference it when clarification is required while generating reports.\n\n**⚙️ Tools & Integrations Used**\nComponent:Tool/Service:Purpose:Workflow Engine:n8n:Automation & orchestration\nLLM Model:OpenAI GPT-4 / Chat Model:Natural language understanding and parsing\nEmbeddings Model:OpenAI Embeddings:Convert text into semantic vector format\nVector Database:Pinecone:Store and retrieve document chunks semantically\nStorage:Google Drive:Source of raw EDI text files and PDF documentation\nDataLoader + Splitter:n8n Node + Recursive Splitter:Loads and prepares documents for embedding\nAI Agents:n8n AI Agent Node:Runs context-aware prompts and parses reports\n\n**🧱 Workflow Breakdown**\n**🧠 1. Vectorizing the Sabre IUR Document (RAG Setup)**\n📘 Objective: Enable the AI Agent to refer to the IUR document (154 pages) for detailed explanations of EDI terms, formats, and rules.\n\nFlow Steps:\n\nGoogle Drive Search + Download – Find and pull the IUR PDF file.\n\nDefault Data Loader – Load the file and preprocess it for semantic splitting.\n\nRecursive Character Splitter – Break down large pages into meaningful chunks.\n\nOpenAI Embeddings – Vectorize each chunk.\n\nPinecone Vector Store – Save into a Pinecone namespace for future retrieval.\n\n✅ Result: The IUR is now searchable via semantic queries from the AI Agent.\n\n**📁 2. Reading and Extracting Data from EDI Files**\n📘 Objective: Parse raw EDI files for financial records and summaries.\n\nFlow Steps:\n\n**Trigger** – Manual or scheduled execution of the workflow.\n\n**Google Drive Search** – Finds all new .edi or .txt files.\n\n**Download File Contents** – Loads content of each file into memory.\n\n**Extract from File** – Raw text extraction.\n\n**📊 3. Report Generation Using AI Agents**\n**📘 Objective:** AI Agents parse the extracted data to generate structured accounting reports.\n\n**a. Accounts Receivable Report Agent**\nThe extracted text is passed to an AI Agent.\n\nModel is connected to:\n\nOpenAI Chat Model (LLM)\n\nPinecone Vector DB (IUR reference)\n\nOutputs a structured AR Summary Report.\n\n**b. Tax and Surcharges Report Agent**\nSame steps as above.\n\nPrompts adjusted to extract tax, fees, surcharges, and amounts.\n\n✅ Output Format: Can be mapped to columns and inserted into a Google Sheet or exported as a CSV/JSON.\n\n📑 Sample Reports You Can Build\nAlready implemented:\n\n✅ Accounts Receivable (AR) Summary Report\n\n✅ Tax and Surcharges Report\n\nCan be extended to:\n3. Accounts Payable (AP)\n4. Passenger Revenue\n5. Daily Sales\n6. Commission Report\n7. Net Profit Margin (if supplier cost + commission is available)\n\n**💡 Key Advantages**\n✅ No-code automation with n8n\n\n✅ Semantic reasoning using AI + Vector DB (RAG)\n\n✅ Can work with various Sabre outputs without manual parsing\n\n✅ Modular: Easy to add new report types\n\n✅ Cloud-integrated (Drive, Pinecone, OpenAI)\n\n**🧪 Potential Improvements**\nArea\tSuggestions\nTesting\tAdd a “Preview” step to validate extracted data before writing\nScalability\tBatch mode + Google Sheet batching for multiple reports\nAudit Trail\tLog every file name, timestamp, report type in a Google Sheet\nNotification\tSend Slack/Email when a new report is generated\nMulti-model support\tAdd Claude/Gemini fallback if OpenAI usage limit is hit\n\n",
