## Learn Supabase Storage Fundamentals with n8n

This template demonstrates how to integrate **Supabase Storage** with **n8n** for uploading, fetching, generating temporary signed URLs, and listing files. It’s a beginner-friendly workflow that helps you understand how to connect Supabase’s storage API with n8n automation.

## Who it’s for
- Developers and teams new to **Supabase** who want a hands-on learning workflow.  
- Anyone looking to automate file uploads and retrieval from **Supabase Storage**.  
- Educators or technical teams teaching Supabase fundamentals with **practical demos**.

## How it works
1. **Upload File** – A user uploads a file through an n8n form, which gets stored in a Supabase storage bucket.  
2. **Fetch File** – Retrieve files by providing their filename.  
3. **Temporary Access** – Generate **signed URLs** with custom expiry for secure file sharing.  
4. **List Objects** – View all stored files in the chosen Supabase bucket.

## How to set up
- Create a **Supabase account** and set up a project.  
- Create a **bucket** in Supabase (e.g., `test-n8n`).  
- Get your **Project URL** and **Anon Key** from Supabase.  
- In n8n, create a **Supabase API Credential** using your keys.  
- Import this workflow and connect it with your credentials.  
- Run the forms to test file upload, retrieval, and listing.
