  "description": "This workflow randomly select recipes from a Mealie instance (can use a specific category) and then creates a meal plan in Mealie with those recipes.\n\n## How it works:\n- Workflow has a scheduled trigger (set to run weekly on a Friday)\n- `Config` node sets a few properties to configure the workflow\n- A call to the Mealie API to get the list of recipes\n- The code node holds most of the logic, this will loop through the number of recipes defined in the config node and randomly select a recipe from the list (making sure not to double up any recipes)\n- Once all the recipes are selected it will call the Mealie API to set up the meal plan on the days\n\n\n## Setup\n- Add your Mealie API token as a credential and set it on the Http Request nodes\n- Set the relevant schedule trigger to run when you like\n- Update the `Config` node with the config you want\n\t- numberOfRecipes - Number of recipes to populate for the meal plan\n\t- offsetPlanDays - Number of days in the future to start the plan (0 will start it today, 1 tomorrow, etc.)\n\t- mealieCategoryId - A category id of the category you want to pull in recipes from (default to select from all recipes)\n\t- mealieBaseUrl - The base url of your Mealie instance\n",
