What this workflow does
-----------------------

Automatically triages inbound security findings (e.g., from AWS Security Hub via EventBridge → SNS → Webhook), classifies them with an LLM, generates a 3-step remediation plan, and emails a compact incident brief.

**Pipeline:** Webhook → Clean_Finding (normalize) → Classify (LLM) → Plan (LLM) → Gmail (email). You can substitute Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.

-   Normalizes the incoming finding JSON (title, description, account, resource id/type, updated_at).

-   Uses an LLM to assign **incident_type**, **severity (P0--P3)**, **urgency**, **short_title**, and **why** (concise rationale).

-   Produces a **3-step remediation plan** with **owner_hint** and **success_criteria**---kept atomic and practical.

-   Sends a clean HTML email with all details (subject line includes short title, resource, and account).

**Category:** Security / Cloud / Incident Management\
**Time to set up:** ~10--15 minutes\
**Difficulty:** Beginner--Intermediate\
**Cost:** Mostly free (n8n CE; OpenAI usage + Gmail/SMTP as used)

What you'll need
----------------

-   An n8n instance reachable over **HTTP** (for the Webhook node).

-   OpenAI (or compatible) credentials set in n8n.

-   Gmail OAuth2 credentials (or swap Gmail node for SMTP).

-   A source that can POST a Security-Hub-style finding to your webhook (EventBridge/SNS, a SIEM, or curl).

**Output (Email)**

-   Subject: `&lt;short_title&gt; - &lt;resource_id&gt; in &lt;account_id&gt;`

-   Body: HTML summary with **Type**, **Account**, **Urgency**, **Why**, **Next Actions (3 steps)**, **Owner**, **Success criteria**.
