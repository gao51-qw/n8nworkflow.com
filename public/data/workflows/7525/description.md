# Automate Sponsored Deal Emails with n8n + AI 🚀  

Managing inbound emails can be exhausting — especially when your inbox is flooded with **sponsored deal requests** that don’t always fit your brand. Manually reading, filtering, and politely declining each one eats up valuable time.  

That’s why I built a **smart n8n workflow** that automatically:  
- Detects sponsored deal inquiries,  
- Decides if they match my criteria,  
- Drafts a **professional, courteous reply**,  
- Or simply ignores irrelevant messages.  

The best part? It runs on autopilot. Let’s break down every single node in this workflow.  



## 🔔 1. Gmail Trigger – “Your Inbox Watchdog”  
- Polls your Gmail inbox **every minute**.  
- Detects new emails instantly.  
- Hands over each email to the next step for analysis.  



## ✂️ 2. Edit Fields (Set Node) – “Extract the Essentials”  
- Pulls out the most important parts of the email:  
  - **From** → Sender’s email address  
  - **Subject** → The email subject line  
  - **Email Body** → The main text content  
- Keeps data structured and ready for AI to process.  



## 🧠 3. AI Agent – “The Smart Classifier”  
- Powered by **LangChain + OpenAI**.  
- Reads the email content carefully.  
- Outputs two things:  
  - **isSponsoredEmail** → true/false  
  - **reason** → why it decided that way  
- Example:  
  ```json
  {
    "isSponsoredEmail": true,
    "reason": "The email mentions a paid collaboration opportunity."
  }

- #### Structured Output Parser – “Keep It Clean”

  Ensures the AI response is always structured properly.

  - Forces the output into this format:
  ```json
	{
  	"isSponsoredEmail": true/false,
  	"reason": "string"
	} 

- Prevents messy AI replies from breaking the workflow.



## 🔀 5. Node – “Decision Maker”
Branches logic into two paths:  
- **If sponsored** → moves on to draft a polite response.  
- **If not sponsored** → sends it to “No Operation” (do nothing).  


## ✍️ 6. AI Agent (Reply Writer) – “Crafts the Perfect Response”
If it’s a sponsored email, this node drafts a professional reply.  

**Reply includes:**  
- Thanking the sender for reaching out.  
- Explaining sponsorship criteria:  
  - Alignment with brand values  
  - Relevance for your audience  
  - Fit with internal planning cycles  
- Politely declining if the timing isn’t right.  
- Leaving the door open for future opportunities.  

**Tone:** professional, warm, and courteous.  



## 📤 7. Gmail Node – “Hit Send!”
- Takes the AI-generated reply.  
- Sends it directly back to the original sender.  
- No manual typing, no waiting — just instant professionalism.  


## 🚫 8. No Operation – “Do Nothing, Gracefully”
- If the email isn’t a sponsored deal, the workflow stops here.  
- No unnecessary actions are taken.  
- Keeps your system clean and efficient.  



## 📝 Sticky Notes (Workflow Documentation)
To make the workflow easier to understand inside **n8n**, sticky notes were added:  
- **Email Trigger** → Explains inbox polling.  
- **Extract** → Notes what fields are being pulled.  
- **Process and Validate** → Describes how AI decides sponsorship.  
- **Prepare Email Body** → Documents reply drafting process.  
- **Reply** → Clarifies auto-reply step.  
- **Do Nothing** → Notes what happens if it’s not sponsored.  



## 🌟 Why This Workflow Rocks
- **Saves Hours:** No more manual email filtering.  
- **Consistent Replies:** Always professional and brand-friendly.  
- **Scalable:** Works for 5 or 500 inbound emails.  
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt prompts and conditions to fit your brand.  



## ⚡ Try It Yourself
This workflow is built in **n8n**, an open-source automation tool.  
You can import the JSON file into your own n8n instance and customize:  
- Your Gmail credentials  
- Your company’s sponsorship guidelines  
- The tone of the AI-generated replies  

👉 With just a few tweaks, you’ll have a smart email assistant running on autopilot!  



## 💡 Pro Tip
Even if you don’t deal with sponsored deals, you can repurpose this workflow for:  
- Job applications  
- Customer support inquiries  
- Lead qualification  

The same logic applies — just adjust the AI prompts and reply template.
