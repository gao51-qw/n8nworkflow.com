  "description": "# Automate Sponsored Deal Emails with n8n + AI 🚀  \n\nManaging inbound emails can be exhausting — especially when your inbox is flooded with **sponsored deal requests** that don’t always fit your brand. Manually reading, filtering, and politely declining each one eats up valuable time.  \n\nThat’s why I built a **smart n8n workflow** that automatically:  \n- Detects sponsored deal inquiries,  \n- Decides if they match my criteria,  \n- Drafts a **professional, courteous reply**,  \n- Or simply ignores irrelevant messages.  \n\nThe best part? It runs on autopilot. Let’s break down every single node in this workflow.  \n\n\n\n## 🔔 1. Gmail Trigger – “Your Inbox Watchdog”  \n- Polls your Gmail inbox **every minute**.  \n- Detects new emails instantly.  \n- Hands over each email to the next step for analysis.  \n\n\n\n## ✂️ 2. Edit Fields (Set Node) – “Extract the Essentials”  \n- Pulls out the most important parts of the email:  \n  - **From** → Sender’s email address  \n  - **Subject** → The email subject line  \n  - **Email Body** → The main text content  \n- Keeps data structured and ready for AI to process.  \n\n\n\n## 🧠 3. AI Agent – “The Smart Classifier”  \n- Powered by **LangChain + OpenAI**.  \n- Reads the email content carefully.  \n- Outputs two things:  \n  - **isSponsoredEmail** → true/false  \n  - **reason** → why it decided that way  \n- Example:  \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"isSponsoredEmail\": true,\n    \"reason\": \"The email mentions a paid collaboration opportunity.\"\n  }\n\n- #### Structured Output Parser – “Keep It Clean”\n\n  Ensures the AI response is always structured properly.\n\n  - Forces the output into this format:\n  ```json\n\t{\n  \t\"isSponsoredEmail\": true/false,\n  \t\"reason\": \"string\"\n\t} \n\n- Prevents messy AI replies from breaking the workflow.\n\n\n\n## 🔀 5. Node – “Decision Maker”\nBranches logic into two paths:  \n- **If sponsored** → moves on to draft a polite response.  \n- **If not sponsored** → sends it to “No Operation” (do nothing).  \n\n\n## ✍️ 6. AI Agent (Reply Writer) – “Crafts the Perfect Response”\nIf it’s a sponsored email, this node drafts a professional reply.  \n\n**Reply includes:**  \n- Thanking the sender for reaching out.  \n- Explaining sponsorship criteria:  \n  - Alignment with brand values  \n  - Relevance for your audience  \n  - Fit with internal planning cycles  \n- Politely declining if the timing isn’t right.  \n- Leaving the door open for future opportunities.  \n\n**Tone:** professional, warm, and courteous.  \n\n\n\n## 📤 7. Gmail Node – “Hit Send!”\n- Takes the AI-generated reply.  \n- Sends it directly back to the original sender.  \n- No manual typing, no waiting — just instant professionalism.  \n\n\n## 🚫 8. No Operation – “Do Nothing, Gracefully”\n- If the email isn’t a sponsored deal, the workflow stops here.  \n- No unnecessary actions are taken.  \n- Keeps your system clean and efficient.  \n\n\n\n## 📝 Sticky Notes (Workflow Documentation)\nTo make the workflow easier to understand inside **n8n**, sticky notes were added:  \n- **Email Trigger** → Explains inbox polling.  \n- **Extract** → Notes what fields are being pulled.  \n- **Process and Validate** → Describes how AI decides sponsorship.  \n- **Prepare Email Body** → Documents reply drafting process.  \n- **Reply** → Clarifies auto-reply step.  \n- **Do Nothing** → Notes what happens if it’s not sponsored.  \n\n\n\n## 🌟 Why This Workflow Rocks\n- **Saves Hours:** No more manual email filtering.  \n- **Consistent Replies:** Always professional and brand-friendly.  \n- **Scalable:** Works for 5 or 500 inbound emails.  \n- **Customizable:** Easily adapt prompts and conditions to fit your brand.  \n\n\n\n## ⚡ Try It Yourself\nThis workflow is built in **n8n**, an open-source automation tool.  \nYou can import the JSON file into your own n8n instance and customize:  \n- Your Gmail credentials  \n- Your company’s sponsorship guidelines  \n- The tone of the AI-generated replies  \n\n👉 With just a few tweaks, you’ll have a smart email assistant running on autopilot!  \n\n\n\n## 💡 Pro Tip\nEven if you don’t deal with sponsored deals, you can repurpose this workflow for:  \n- Job applications  \n- Customer support inquiries  \n- Lead qualification  \n\nThe same logic applies — just adjust the AI prompts and reply template.  \n",
