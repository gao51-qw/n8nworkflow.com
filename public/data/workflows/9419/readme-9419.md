# Automated lead qualification for JotForm with Google Gemini & Telegram alerts

> ## Smart Lead Qualification for JotForm Contact Forms

Automatically classify and manage contact form submissions using AI-powered lead scoring. This workflow analyzes JotForm submissions in real-time, categorizes them as hot leads, cold leads, or spam, and takes intelligent actions—sending Telegram notifications for hot leads, ignoring irrelevant inquiries, and automatically deleting spam.

## Who's It For

This template is perfect for:
- **Businesses receiving high volumes of contact form submissions** who need to prioritize responses
- **Marketing and sales teams** wanting to focus on qualified leads immediately
- **Agencies and consultants** offering AI/automation services who want to filter out noise
- **Anyone struggling with spam** or low-quality form submissions

## What It Does

The workflow uses Google Gemini AI to intelligently classify each JotForm submission into three categories:

- **Hot Lead (1)**: Genuine inquiries about your services, collaboration requests, or project proposals → Sends Telegram notification + Flags in JotForm
- **Cold Lead (0)**: Legitimate but irrelevant inquiries (job applications, unrelated business queries) → No action taken
- **Garbage/Spam (2)**: Test submissions, bots, gibberish, or fake data → Automatically deleted from JotForm

## How It Works

1. JotForm trigger captures new contact form submissions
2. Submission data is extracted and formatted
3. Google Gemini AI analyzes the content and classifies the lead
4. A switch routes the submission based on classification:
   - Hot leads trigger Telegram notifications and get flagged
   - Cold leads are ignored
   - Spam submissions are automatically deleted

## Requirements

- **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)
- **JotForm account** with a contact form ([Get JotForm here](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=roshanramanidev))
- **Google Gemini API key** (free tier available)
- **Telegram account** for notifications
