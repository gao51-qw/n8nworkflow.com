## Description
- Automates error detection and notification to prevent production downtime.
- Monitors incoming webhooks, filters critical errors, and triggers alerts or bug reports.
- Ensures rapid response to critical issues in real-time.

## Essential Information
- Processes webhook triggers to detect errors instantly.
- Filters and categorizes errors as critical or non-critical.
- Sends Slack alerts for critical errors and creates Jira bugs as needed.

## System Architecture
- **Error Detection Pipeline**:
  - **Webhook Trigger**: Captures incoming error data via POST requests.
  - **Filter Critical Errors**: Identifies and separates critical errors.
- **Alert Generation Flow**:
  - **Send Slack Alert**: Notifies the team via Slack for critical errors.
  - **Create Jira Bug**: Logs critical errors as Jira issues.
- **Non-Critical Handling**:
  - **No Action for Non-Critical**: Skips non-critical errors with no further action.

## Implementation Guide
- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
- Configure webhook URL and test with sample error data.
- Set up Slack and Jira credentials for alerts and bug creation.
- Test error filtering and notification flows.
- Monitor alert accuracy and adjust filter rules as needed.

## Technical Dependencies
- Webhook service for error data ingestion.
- Slack API for real-time notifications.
- Jira API for bug tracking and issue creation.
- n8n for workflow automation.

## Customization Possibilities
- Adjust `Filter Critical Errors` node to refine error severity rules.
- Customize Slack alert messages in `Send Slack Alert` node.
- Modify Jira issue templates in `Create Jira Bug` node.
- Add logging node to track all errors for analysis.
- Integrate with additional notification tools (e.g., email).
