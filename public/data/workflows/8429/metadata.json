  "description": "# Product Overview\n\nScale short-form content without scaling your team. This template turns **idea discovery → prompt & text generation → Veo-3 video rendering → vertical formatting → multi-channel publishing** into one cohesive pipeline. It’s built natively on **n8n**, so you keep full control, self-host if you want, and extend every step with your own logic.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Inside (Modular Building Blocks)\n\n- **Idea Engine** – AI generates concise, surprising facts and a visual metaphor per topic (swappable LLM/provider).  \n- **Prompt & Text Composer** – Crafts an 8-second, cinematic Veo-3 prompt + title, caption, description, hashtags, tags in a consistent brand voice.  \n- **Renderer Integration** – Kie.ai → Veo-3 (16:9, 1080p) for fast, cinematic clips.  \n- **Vertical Formatter** – FFmpeg pipeline converts to 1080×1920, adds top/bottom text bands (15–20 words), and preserves loop smoothness.  \n- **Multi-Channel Distribution** – Uploads to YouTube Shorts and Telegram for internal review/approvals.  \n- **Scheduler & Orchestration** – CRON triggers, retries, and lightweight polling make the system dependable for daily publishing.  \n\n---\n\n## Why These Components (and why they work together)\n\n- **Veo-3 via Kie.ai** provides a sweet spot of **quality + speed**, ideal for short loops where style coherence matters.  \n- **n8n** brings **vendor-neutral orchestration**: swap LLMs, add rate limits, branch flows, or trigger on events—without rewriting your stack.  \n- **FFmpeg** ensures a **platform-native look** (9:16, crisp text bands, no blurry hacks).  \n- **Separation of concerns** (idea → text → render → edit → publish) makes it easy to **A/B test** any stage independently.  \n\n---\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Hands-Free Consistency** – Daily output with a repeatable creative pattern that audiences recognize.  \n- **Brand-Safe Copy** – Titles, descriptions, and hashtags follow a controlled structure—polished by design.  \n- **Time Savings** – Replace fragmented tooling with one pipeline; no manual re-formatting, captioning, or re-uploads.  \n- **Creator-Grade Quality** – Cinematic loops optimized for watch time and retention on Shorts/Reels.  \n- **Own Your Stack** – Self-hosted orchestration and storage; no lock-in.  \n\n---\n\n## Reuse & Extension Ideas\n\n- **Topic CMS** – Feed topics from Google Sheets / Notion and mark each as “published”—perfect for content calendars.  \n- **Multi-Language** – Duplicate the text composer for EN/DE outputs; upload the same clip with localized metadata.  \n- **Thumbnail/Preview Track** – Add an image generator step for platform cards or YouTube custom thumbnails.  \n- **Analytics Feedback Loop** – Fetch video performance, score ideas, and prioritize winning angles automatically.  \n- **Compliance & Fact Trails** – Store sources next to each post for quick audits and edits.  \n- **Storage & Delivery** – Push masters to S3/Backblaze, serve via CDN for faster IG ingestion.  \n- **More Channels** – Add TikTok, X, LinkedIn publishers or a newsletter export.  \n- **A/B Creative** – Render multiple Veo-3 seeds, rotate captions/CTAs, and compare retention.  \n\n---\n\n## Who It’s For\n\n- **Agencies** wanting repeatable, branded Shorts at scale.  \n- **Creators & Media Teams** who need daily output with minimal overhead.  \n- **Product Marketing** looking to convert docs/reports into snackable, evergreen video facts.  \n- **Startups** building audience fast without adding headcount.  \n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes (at a glance)\n\n- **Orchestration:** n8n (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- **Video:** Veo-3 via Kie.ai (16:9 render → FFmpeg vertical remaster 1080×1920)  \n- **Text Stack:** Any LLM provider (swappable); outputs normalized for each platform  \n- **Distribution:** YouTube Data API v3,  Telegram Bot API  \n- **Security:** API keys via n8n credentials/ENV; public URL endpoint only serves whitelisted `.mp4` filenames with proper headers  \n- **Reliability:** CRON triggers, bounded retries/polling, and safe fallbacks to avoid stuck runs  \n\n---\n## Who to use it\n\nTo enhance the completeness, add specific **step-by-step setup instructions** for users to implement the workflow easily:\n\n1. **Install Prerequisites**\n   - Set up **n8n** on your server or local machine (production mode with reverse proxy).\n   - Install **FFmpeg** and ensure fonts (e.g., *DejaVu Sans*) are available.\n\n2. **Configure API Credentials**\n   - Get a **Perplexity API key** for idea generation.\n   - Request a **Kie.ai API key** for Veo-3 video rendering.\n   - Set up **YouTube OAuth2** (enable YouTube Data API v3 in Google Cloud Console).\n   - Create a **Telegram bot token** via BotFather.\n   - Store all keys as **environment variables** in n8n (avoid hardcoding).\n\n3. **Prepare Storage**\n   - Create a working directory accessible by n8n with read/write rights.\n   - Ensure enough disk space for video caching (approx. 50–200 MB per run).\n\n4. **Set Scheduling**\n   - Add **CRON triggers** for automatic execution (e.g., twice daily).\n   - Example:\n     ```\n     0 12 04 * * * → 04:12 AM daily\n     0 12 16 * * * → 04:12 PM daily\n     ```\n\n5. **Define Variables**\n   - File naming conventions:\n     - `name_vorher` = raw 16:9 video\n     - `name_nachher` = final 9:16 video\n   - Set `topic` = content niche (e.g., *history, ocean, futurism*).\n\n6. **Build Workflow Steps in n8n**\n   - **Idea Generation:** Perplexity node for viral fact.\n   - **Prompt Agent:** Expand into full package (prompt, caption, hashtags).\n   - **Video Generation:** Kie.ai Veo-3 API request (poll until success).\n   - **Download & Edit:** Save raw file, convert to 9:16 with FFmpeg overlays.\n   - **Notifications & Uploads:**\n     - Telegram node → send video.\n     - YouTube node → upload with title, description, tags.\n     \n\n7. **Test End-to-End**\n   - Run the workflow manually once.\n   - Verify video rendering, FFmpeg subtitles, Telegram message, YouTube & IG uploads.\n\n8. **Go Live**\n   - Enable CRON triggers.\n   - Monitor first runs for errors (API limits, FFmpeg paths, token expiry).\n\n---\n\n## Why Buy This Template\n\nYou’re not buying a script—you’re buying a **production-ready system** with a deliberate creative pattern, best-practice formatting, and shipping-grade integrations. It reduces ramp-up from weeks to hours and gives you a flexible base you can keep evolving.\n\n---\n\n",
