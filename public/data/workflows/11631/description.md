Automate your Instagram growth strategy by generating and posting viral Reels using AI and Creatomate. This workflow plans content topics based on trends, generates video assets, and handles the approval and posting process—all without manual video editing.

## How it works

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs every day at 9:00 AM.
2. **Topic Planning**: Checks past topics from Google Sheets to avoid duplicates, then uses OpenAI (GPT-4o) to generate a new quiz-style content plan.
3. **Video Generation**: Uses Creatomate to generate a video based on a template, dynamically inserting the AI-generated text and images.
4. **Approval Loop**: Sends the generated video to Slack for human review.
5. **Posting**: Once approved in Slack, the workflow automatically uploads the Reel to Instagram.
6. **Logging**: Saves the new topic to Google Sheets and notifies Slack upon successful publication.
