  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## How it works\n\nThis advanced automation builds a **fully autonomous SEO blog writer** using **n8n**, **Scrapeless**, **LLMs**, and **Pinecone vector database**. It’s powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that collects high-performing blog content, stores it in a vector store, and then generates new blog posts based on that knowledge—endlessly.\n\n## Part 1: Build a Knowledge Base from Popular Blogs\n\n- **Scrape existing articles** from a well-established writer (in this case, Mark Manson) using the Scrapeless node.\n- **Extract content from blog pages** and store it in **Pinecone**, a powerful vector database that supports similarity search.\n- **Use Gemini Embedding 001** or any other supported embedding model to encode blog content into vectors.\n- **Result**: You’ll have a searchable vector store of expert-level content, ready to be used for content generation and intelligent search.\n\n## Part 2: SERP Analysis & AI Blog Generation\n\n- Use **Scrapeless' SERP node** to fetch search results based on your keyword and search intent.\n- Send the results to an **LLM** (like Gemini, OpenRouter, or OpenAI) to generate a **keyword analysis report** in Markdown → then converted to HTML.\n- Extract **long-tail keywords**, **search intent insights**, and **content angles** from this report.\n- Feed everything into another LLM with access to your **Pinecone-stored knowledge base**, and generate a **fully SEO-optimized blog post**.\n\n\n## Set up steps\n\n### Prerequisites\n- [**Scrapeless API key**](https://scrapeless.com/?utm_source=n8n&utm_campaign=ai-powered-blog-writer)\n\n![image.png](fileId:1757)\n- [Pinecone account and index setup](https://www.pinecone.io/)\n- An embedding model (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- n8n instance with **Community Node: `n8n-nodes-scrapeless`** installed\n\n### Credential Configuration\n- Add your Scrapeless and Pinecone credentials in n8n under the \"Credentials\" tab\n- Choose embedding dimensions according to the model you use (e.g., 768 for Gemini Embedding 001)\n\n\n## Key Highlights\n\n- **Clones a real content creator**: Replicates knowledge and writing style from top-performing blog authors.\n- **Auto-scrapes hundreds of blog posts** without being blocked.\n- **Stores expert content** in a vector DB to build a reusable knowledge base.\n- **Performs real-time SERP analysis** using Scrapeless to fetch and analyze search data.\n- **Generates SEO blog drafts** using RAG with detailed keyword intelligence.\n- **Output includes**: blog title, HTML summary report, long-tail keywords, and AI-written article body.\n\n\n## RAG + SEO: The Future of Content Creation\n\nThis template combines:\n- **AI reasoning** from large language models\n- **Reliable data scraping** from Scrapeless\n- **Scalable storage** via Pinecone vector DB\n- **Flexible orchestration** using n8n nodes\n\nThis is **not just an automation**—it’s a **full-stack SEO content machine** that enables you to:\n- Build a domain-specific knowledge base\n- Run intelligent keyword research\n- Generate traffic-ready content on autopilot\n\n\n## 💡 Use Cases\n\n- SaaS content teams cloning competitor success\n- Affiliate marketers scaling high-traffic blog production\n- Agencies offering automated SEO content services\n- AI researchers building personal knowledge bots\n- Writers automating first-draft generation with real-world tone\n\n",
