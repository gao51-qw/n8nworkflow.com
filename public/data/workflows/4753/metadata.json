I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).\n\nI help logistics teams reduce operational workload and errors by combining **AI automation**, **route optimisation APIs**, and **workflow automation**.\n\nThis workflow is part of a **circular economy project**, where stores return **reusable packaging** (bins, crates, containers) to a central warehouse.\n\n&gt; Let's create circular economies with AI-powered automation using n8n!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for logistics teams participating in **circular economy loops**.\n\nLet us imagine your transportation company receives this **pickup request**:\n\n[![Example of Results](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-15.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\nThe two **AI Agent nodes** connected to **Openroute Service API** will process the information and reply with the **detailed route plan**.\n\n[![Workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-16.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\nThe results include **driving time** and the **optimal sequence** of stops generated by the multi-stop optimization endpoint of the API.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThis workflow automates the end-to-end processing of **multi-stop pickup requests for reusable packaging**:\n\n- 📨 Gmail Trigger listens for collection request emails  \n- 🧠 AI Agent parses the email into structured data (store ID, address, date)  \n- 📍 Each stop is geocoded into GPS coordinates  \n- 🗺️ OpenRouteService **optimizes the stop sequence** using truck-specific routing  \n- 📄 A second AI Agent formats a **confirmation email in HTML** with the ordered pickup plan  \n- 📧 The reply is sent back with all details including duration and route\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. 💌 Trigger on a new Gmail message  \n2. 🧠 Extract data using AI Agent (e.g., stores, addresses, times)  \n3. 📑 Store raw and processed data in Google Sheets  \n4. 📍 Enrich with GPS coordinates  \n5. 🚚 Optimize route using OpenRouteService (truck profile)  \n6. 📄 Format the confirmation using an AI Agent  \n7. 📬 Send reply to requester with route and timing\n\n[![workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/06/image-14.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\n### What do I need to get started?\n\nYou’ll need:\n\n- A **Gmail account** to receive collection requests  \n- A **Google Sheet** to store and review data  \n- A free [OpenRouteService API key](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup)  \n- Access to OpenAI for using AI Agent nodes  \n- Sample pickup request emails to test\n\n### Next Steps\n\n🗒️ Use the sticky notes inside the n8n canvas to:\n\n- Plug in your Gmail and OpenRouteService credentials  \n- Try with a sample store collection email  \n- Validate the confirmation format and route accuracy\n\n### 📺 Learn More with n8n Tutorials \n\nGet hands-on experience with automation through my comprehensive **n8n tutorial playlist**, featuring 18+ complete, step-by-step videos and ready-to-use templates.\n\n[![n8n Playlist](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-9.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\n\n*This template was built using n8n v1.93.0*  \n*Submitted: June 7, 2025*",
