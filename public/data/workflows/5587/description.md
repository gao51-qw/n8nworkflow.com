This sub-workflow uses two custom Hugging Face regression models from Open Paws to evaluate and predict the real-world performance and advocacy alignment of text content. It’s designed to support animal advocacy organizations in optimizing their messaging across platforms like social media, email campaigns, and more.

### 🛠️ What It Does

* Sends input text to two deployed Hugging Face endpoints:

  * **Predicted Performance Model** – Estimates real-world content success (e.g., engagement, shares, opens) based on patterns from real online data.
  * **Advocate Preference Model** – Predicts how well the content will resonate with animal advocates (emotional impact, relevance, rationality, etc.)
* Outputs structured scores for both models
* Can be integrated into larger workflows for automated content review, filtering, or revision

### 📊 About the Models

* **Text Performance Prediction Model**
  Trained on real-world data from **30+ animal advocacy organizations**, this model predicts actual online performance of content—including social media, email marketing, and other outreach channels.

* **Advocate Preference Prediction Model**
  Trained on ratings from animal advocates to evaluate how well a piece of text aligns with advocacy goals and values.
