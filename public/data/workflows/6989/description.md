#### 🔍 What It Does:
This n8n automation identifies Magento 2 orders that have been stuck in the same status (like "processing") for the past 7 weekdays (excluding weekends), compiles them into a clean Google Sheet report, and emails the store manager every Monday morning with a snapshot and link to the full data for immediate action.

#### ⚙️ Technical Highlights:
- Automatically runs every Monday at 8 AM using the Schedule Trigger.
- Dynamically calculates business days only (excluding weekends) to identify stale orders.
- Fetches order data using Magento 2 REST API.
- Filters and formats key details like customer name, order value, phone, and email.
- Stores the data in a Google Sheet titled with the current date.
- Sends a professionally formatted HTML email to the manager with:
- A summary table of stuck orders.
- A button linking directly to the full Google Sheet report.

#### ✅ Ideal For:
- Magento 2 store owners/managers who need better visibility on stuck or delayed orders.
- Operations teams who want to avoid lost revenue or customer complaints due to order inaction.
- Automation engineers looking to integrate Google Workspace and Magento efficiently using n8n.
- 📈 Why This Matters in the Current Market:
- In e-commerce, stuck orders = lost trust and lost revenue. As fulfillment expectations continue to rise, proactively managing delayed or idle orders is crucial. This workflow empowers store managers to act fast, reduce manual monitoring, and keep operations smooth — all while preserving customer satisfaction and operational reputation.

- HTTP Request (Magento 2 REST API)
- Code (JavaScript logic for date filtering, formatting)
