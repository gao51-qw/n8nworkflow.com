**Purpose of workflow:**
The purpose of this workflow is to automate  scraping of a website, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it directly into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. 

**How it works:**

1. Web Scraping: Uses the Jina AI service to scrape website data and convert it into LLM-friendly text.
2. Information Extraction: Employs an AI node to extract specific book details (title, price, availability, image URL, product URL) from the scraped data.
3. Data Splitting: Splits the extracted information into individual book entries.
4. Google Sheets Integration: Automatically populates a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the structured book data.

**Step by step setup:**

1. Set up Jina AI service:
   - Sign up for a Jina AI account and obtain an API key.


2. Configure the HTTP Request node:
   - Enter the Jina AI URL with the target website.
   - Add the API key to the request headers for authentication.

3. Set up the Information Extractor node:
   - Use Claude AI to generate a JSON schema for data extraction.
   - Upload a screenshot of the target website to Claude AI.
   - Ask Claude AI to suggest a JSON schema for extracting required information.
   - Copy the generated schema into the Information Extractor node.

4. Configure the Split node:
   - Set it up to separate the extracted data into individual book entries.

5. Set up the Google Sheets node:
   - Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with columns for title, price, availability, image URL, and product URL.
   - Configure the node to map the extracted data to the appropriate columns.
