  "description": "🔄 Purpose of the Workflow:\nThe Update-N8N workflow is designed to automatically trigger a (Portainer) webhook to update an N8N container, but only if a new version of N8N is available.\n\n⚙️ Detailed Workflow Steps:\n🕒 Scheduled Trigger\nThe workflow runs every 16 hours at minute 8 using a schedule trigger node.\n\n🌐 Fetch Latest N8N Version\nIt sends an HTTP GET request to https://registry.npmjs.org/n8n/latest to retrieve the latest published N8N version from the npm registry.\n\n📈 Get Currently Running Local Version\nAnother HTTP GET request is sent to https://127.0.0.1/metrics (likely the Prometheus metrics endpoint of the local N8N instance) to extract the currently installed N8N version.\n\n🧠 Version Comparison\nThe workflow compares the local version (parsed from metrics) with the latest available version.\n\n📬 Trigger Portainer Webhook\nIf the versions do not match (i.e., an update is available), a POST request is sent to a webhook URL, which might be a Portainer webhook that redeploys or updates the N8N container/stack. \n\n✅ Key Benefits:\nNo manual checks or updates needed.\n\nTriggers only when a new version is available.\n\nIntegrates seamlessly with Portainer via webhook.\n\nSecure configuration, e.g., disallowing unauthorized TLS certs for external requests.",
