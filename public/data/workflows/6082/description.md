How it works

This workflow automates the process of handling incoming emails by:

1. Receiving emails via IMAP.
2. Converting the email to Markdown for better AI understanding.
3. Summarizing the email using an AI model.
4. Drafting a professional reply with AI, based on the summary.
5. Requesting human approval for the AI-generated response.
6. Sending the approved reply back to the original sender.
