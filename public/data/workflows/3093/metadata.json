  "description": "## Workflow Overview:\nExtract text from image using AI is worth because you need no code. It incorporates Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model for important text extraction from image. If you code without AI, you have to use multiple condition and may cause a lot of bug but with Google Gemini, you don't need any coding and if the Pay Slip is different, Gemini will extract it automatically.\n## Workflow description:\n1. User uses Line Messaging API to send Pay Slip image or message to the chatbot, create Line Business ID from here: [Line Business](https://account.line.biz/login)\n2. Classify the message which is image or text\n3. If the message is Pay Slip image, it will process using Gemini 2.0 Flash EXP and extract important information and response in JSON format without coding by using the following prompt: Analyze image and then return in JSON Response that has the only following value: **Status, From, To, Date, Amount**\n![slip.png](fileId:995)\nTo get Google AI Studio API Key, you can find from the following link: [Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)\n4.
