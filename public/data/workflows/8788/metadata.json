  "description": "**Automate multi-document handling with AI-powered extraction that adapts to any format and organizes it instantly.**\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. **Monitors Google Drive** for new uploads (receipts, resumes, claims, physician orders, blueprints, or any doc type)\n2. **Automatically downloads and prepares** files for analysis\n3. **Identifies the document type** using Google Gemini\n4. **Parses structured data** via the trusted [VLM Run node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vlm-run/n8n-nodes-vlmrun) with OCR + layout parsing\n5. **Stores records in Google Sheets** — AI Agent maps values to the correct sheet dynamically\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:** Google Drive & Google Sheets accounts, VLM Run API credentials, n8n instance.\n\nInstall the verified [VLM Run node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vlm-run/n8n-nodes-vlmrun) by searching for **VLM Run** in the node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can integrate it directly for high-accuracy data extraction.\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\n1. Configure Google Drive OAuth2 and select a folder for uploads\n\n2. Add [VLM Run API credentials](https://app.vlm.run/dashboard)\n\n3. Create a **Master Reference Google Sheet** with the following structure:\n\n   | Document_Name          | Spreadsheet_ID                |\n   | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n   | Receipt                | your-receipt-sheet-id         |\n   | Resume                 | your-resume-sheet-id          |\n   | Physician Order        | your-physician-order-sheet-id |\n   | Claims Processing      | your-claims-sheet-id          |\n   | Construction Blueprint | your-blueprint-sheet-id       |\n\n   The **first column** holds the document type, and the **second column** holds the target sheet ID where extracted data should be appended.\n\n4. In the **AI Agent node**, edit the **agent prompt** to:\n\n   * Analyze the JSON payload from VLM Run\n   * Look up the document type in the Master Reference Sheet\n   * If a matching sheet exists → fetch headers, then append data accordingly\n   * If headers don’t exist → create them from JSON keys, then insert values\n   * If no sheet exists → add the new type to the Master Reference with an empty Spreadsheet ID\n\n5. Test with a sample upload and activate the workflow\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n**Extend functionality by:**\n\n* Adjusting the AI Agent prompt to support any new document schema (just update field mappings)\n* Adding support for multi-language OCR or complex layouts in VLM Run\n* Linking Sheets data to BI dashboards or reporting tools\n* Triggering notifications when new entries are stored\n\nThis workflow leverages the **VLM Run node for flexible, precision extraction** and the **AI Agent for intelligent mapping**, creating a powerful system that adapts to any document type with minimal setup changes.\n",
