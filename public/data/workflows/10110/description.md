Enhance financial oversight with this automated n8n workflow. Triggered every 5 minutes, it fetches real-time bank transactions via an API, enriches and transforms the data, and applies smart logic to detect critical, high, and medium priority alerts based on error conditions, amounts, or risk scores. It sends multi-channel notifications via email and Slack, logs all data to Google Sheets, and generates summary statistics for comprehensive tracking. 💰🚨

### Key Features  
- Real-time monitoring every 5 minutes for instant alerts.  
- Smart prioritization (Critical, High, Medium) based on risk and errors.  
- Multi-channel notifications via email and Slack.  
- Detailed logging and summary reports in Google Sheets.  

### How It Works  
1. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs every 5 minutes.  
2. **Fetch Transactions**: HTTP request retrieves real-time transaction data.  
3. **API Error?**: If condition for error logic is met, sends error alert.  
4. **Enrich & Transform Data**: Advanced risk calculation enhances data.  
5. **Critical Alert?**: If condition (50% or risk &gt; 8) is met, raises alert.  
6. **High Priority?**: If condition (5% or risk &gt; 7) is met, raises alert.  
7. **Medium Priority?**: If condition is met, raises alert.  
8. **Log Priority to Sheet**: Google Sheets appends critical, high, or medium priority data.  
9. **Send Critical Email**: HTML email to execute sheets append.  
10. **Send High Priority Email**: Email to finance team.  
11. **Send High Priority Slack**: Slack notification to finance team.  
12. **Send Medium Priority Email**: Email to finance team.  
13. **Merge All Alerts**: Combines all alerts for comprehensive tracking.  
14. **Generate Summary Stats**: Code block for analytics.  
15. **Log Summary to Sheet**: Summary statistics storage.
