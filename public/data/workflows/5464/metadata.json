  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* \n\n## 🧠 How It Works\n\nThis workflow automates the process of screening resumes using AI, logging results to Google Sheets, and sending follow-up emails via Gmail.\n\n1. User uploads their resume via a form (PDF only).\n2. Resume content is extracted and sent to OpenAI for evaluation.\n3. AI scores the resume based on:\n   - Role-specific must-have qualifications\n   - Soft skills / strategic fit questions\n4. Based on the **score threshold**, the candidate is classified as:\n   - ✅ **Accepted** → Saved to Accepted sheet + Gmail invite\n   - ❌ **Rejected** → Logged to Rejected sheet + Gmail rejection message\n5. Output is stored in Google Sheets with detailed justification.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Set Up Steps\n\n1. 🔑 Connect your OpenAI and Google Sheets credentials.\n2. Replace the placeholder tags in the AI prompt:\n   - `COMPANY_NAME`\n   - `ROLE_NAME`\n   - `ROLE_DESCRIPTION`\n   - `CRITERIA_1` to `CRITERIA_5`\n   - `Q1` to `Q5`\n   - `THRESHOLD` (score to pass)\n3.  Customize Gmail messages (optional).\n4. ✅ Make sure your sheet has two tabs: `Accepted` and `Rejected`.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Notes\n\nSticky Notes included in the flow explain:\n- What each node does\n- Where to replace variables\n- Tips for improving match scoring\n",
