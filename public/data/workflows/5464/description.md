## 🧠 How It Works

This workflow automates the process of screening resumes using AI, logging results to Google Sheets, and sending follow-up emails via Gmail.

1. User uploads their resume via a form (PDF only).
2. Resume content is extracted and sent to OpenAI for evaluation.
3. AI scores the resume based on:
   - Role-specific must-have qualifications
   - Soft skills / strategic fit questions
4. Based on the **score threshold**, the candidate is classified as:
   - ✅ **Accepted** → Saved to Accepted sheet + Gmail invite
   - ❌ **Rejected** → Logged to Rejected sheet + Gmail rejection message
5. Output is stored in Google Sheets with detailed justification.
