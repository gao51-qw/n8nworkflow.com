# Comprehensive SEO keyword research & analysis with DataForSEO and Google Sheets

> Overview

This n8n workflow, named "Keyword Search for Blogs," automates the process of gathering and organizing keyword research data for SEO purposes. It integrates with Google Sheets and Google Drive to manage input and output data, and leverages the DataForSEO API to fetch comprehensive keyword-related information, including related keywords, keyword suggestions, keyword ideas, autocomplete suggestions, subtopics, and SERP (Search Engine Results Page) analysis. The workflow is designed to streamline SEO research by collecting, processing, and storing data in an organized manner for blog content creation.

Workflow Functionality

The workflow performs the following key functions:





Trigger: Initiated manually via the "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" node, allowing users to start the process on-demand.



Input Data Retrieval: Reads primary keywords, location, and language data from a specified Google Sheet ("SEO PRO").



Spreadsheet Creation: Creates a new Google Sheet with a dynamic title based on the current date (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD-seo pro") and predefined sheet names for organizing different types of keyword data (e.g., keyword, SERP, Content, related keyword, keyword ideas, suggested keyword, subtopics, autocomplete).



Google Drive Integration: Moves the newly created spreadsheet to a designated folder ("seo pro") in Google Drive for organized storage.



API Data Collection:





Related Keywords: Fetches related keywords using the DataForSEO API (/v3/dataforseo_labs/google/related_keywords/live), including SERP information and keyword metrics like search volume, CPC, and competition.

People Also Ask & Organic Results: Pulls "People Also Ask" questions and organic SERP results via the DataForSEO API (/v3/serp/google/organic/live/advanced).



Data Processing:





Uses Split Out nodes to break down API responses into individual items for processing.



Employs Edit Fields nodes to map and format data, extracting relevant fields like keyword, search intent, search volume, CPC, competition, keyword difficulty, and SERP item types.



Filters SERP results to separate "People Also Ask" and organic results for targeted processing.



Data Storage: Appends processed data to multiple sheets in the destination Google Sheet ("2025-06-08-seo pro") across different tabs:





Master Sheet: Stores comprehensive data including keywords, search intent, related keywords, SERP analysis, and more.



Related Keywords: Stores related keyword data with metrics.



Suggested Keywords: Stores suggested keyword data.



Keyword Ideas: Stores keyword ideas with relevant metrics.

Scalability: Processes multiple keywords and their related data in a single workflow run, with a limit of 100 related items per API call.



Dynamic Organization: Creates and organizes data in a new Google Sheet with a timestamped title, ensuring easy tracking of research over time.
