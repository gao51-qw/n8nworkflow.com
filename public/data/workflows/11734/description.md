## 📘 Description
This workflow turns raw product inputs into a complete, launch-ready AI-generated social media campaign package. It accepts product details via webhook, sanitizes messy fields, generates a strategic campaign blueprint, produces Instagram captions, creates discovery-optimized hashtags, generates photorealistic commercial images, computes optimal posting times, assembles all outputs into a unified JSON package, and finally delivers the entire campaign to Slack.
Multiple AI agents work in sequence to generate structured outputs — each parsed and validated using strict JSON schemas. Images produced by DALL·E 3 are uploaded to Cloudinary for hosting. A post-processing module then merges captions, images, hashtags, and schedules into a final payload. A robust error handler ensures every failure is captured and sent to Slack with diagnostic information.
This workflow replaces an entire marketing team’s creative production pipeline, producing consistent, multi-asset campaign kits in minutes.
