  "description": "This workflow demonstrates a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline in n8n, split into two main sections:\n\n🔹 Part 1: Load Data into Vector Store\nReads files from disk (or Google Drive).\n\nSplits content into manageable chunks using a recursive text splitter.\n\nGenerates embeddings using the Cohere Embedding API.\n\nStores the vectors into an In-Memory Vector Store (for simplicity; can be replaced with Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.).\n\n🔹 Part 2: Chat with the Vector Store\nTakes user input from a chat UI or trigger node.\n\nEmbeds the query using the same Cohere embedding model.\n\nRetrieves similar chunks from the vector store via similarity search.\n\nUses Groq-hosted LLM to generate a final answer based on the context.\n\n🛠️ Technologies Used:\n📦 Cohere Embedding API\n\n⚡ Groq LLM for fast inference\n\n🧠 n8n for orchestrating and visualizing the flow\n\n🧲 In-Memory Vector Store (for prototyping)\n\n🧪 Usage:\nUpload or point to your source documents.\n\nEmbed them and populate the vector store.\n\nAsk questions through the chat trigger node.\n\nReceive context-aware responses based on retrieved content.\n\n",
