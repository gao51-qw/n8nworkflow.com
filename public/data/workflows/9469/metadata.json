  "description": "![Transfer Adobe Commerce customers and orders to KlickTipp with conditional Tagging.png](fileId:2982)\nCommunity Node Disclaimer: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n### Introduction\nThis workflow monitors orders and customers in Adobe Commerce, automatically creating or updating contacts in KlickTipp, enriching profiles for segmentation and automated messaging. Tags are applied dynamically: high-value orders (≥100) receive a \"Premium Customer\" tag, and purchases with certain SKUs (e.g., clothing) are assigned product-based tags. Perfect for e-commerce businesses, online retailers, and digital shops that want to eliminate manual data entry and ensure every buyer and customer receives the right messages.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n1. **KlickTipp Preparation**\n      - Prepare **custom fields**\n       - `Payment ID`\n       - `Total`\n       - `Receipt URL`\n       - `Products`\n      - Prepare **tags**:\n       - `Premium customer`\n       - `Clothing buyer`\n\n2. **Credential Configuration**\n     - Connect your Magento account using an **Access Token/Base URL** from the Magento Admin Dashboard (System → Extensions → Integrations).\n     - Authenticate your KlickTipp connection with **username/password** credentials (API access required).\n\n### Customization\n- **Trigger options:** If your Commerce edition supports **webhooks**, you can replace polling with a **Webhook** trigger.  \n- **Cadence & overlap:** 1–30 min are typical; a 1–2 min overlap in the filter to avoid gaps.  \n- **Routing variants:** Change the SKU list, switch to category checks, or add more value tiers.",
