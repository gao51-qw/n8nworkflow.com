## Trigger & Topic Extraction

The workflow starts manually or from a chat/Telegram/webhook input.

A “topic extractor” node scans the incoming text and cleans it (handles /topic … commands).

If no topic is detected, it defaults to a sample news headline.

## Style & Structure Setup

A style guide node defines the blog’s tone: practical, medium–low formality, clear sections, clean HTML only.

It also enforces do’s (citations, links, actionable steps) and don’ts (no clickbait, no low-quality sources).

## Research & Drafting

A GPT node generates a 1,700–1,800 word article following the style guide.

Sections include: What happened, Why it matters, Opportunities/risks, Action plan, FAQ.

The draft is then polished for clarity and flow.

## Quality Control

A word count guard checks that the article is at least 1,600 words.

If too short, a GPT “expand draft” node deepens the Why it matters, Risks, and Action plan sections.

## Image Creation

The final article’s title and content are used to generate an editorial-style image prompt.

Leonardo AI creates a cinematic, text-free featured image suitable for Google News/Discover.

The image is uploaded to WordPress, with proper ALT text generated by GPT.

## Publishing to WordPress

The final post (title, content, featured image) is automatically published.

Sources are extracted from the article, compiled into a “Sources” section with clickable links.

Posts are categorized and published immediately.
