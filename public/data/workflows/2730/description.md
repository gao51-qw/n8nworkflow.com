Using the OpenWeatherMap API and Airtable, this solution gathers vital weather details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The automation ensures daily updates, creating a dependable historical record of weather patterns for future reference and analysis.

## Steps:

### Set Schedule Trigger
Configure a Cron node to trigger the workflow daily, for example, at 7 AM.

### Fetch Weather Data (HTTP Request)

- Use the HTTP Request node to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Include your API key and query parameters (e.g., q=London, unit=metric) to specify the city and desired units.

### Parse Weather Data

Utilize a JSON Parse node to extract key weather details, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, from the API response.

### Store Data in Airtable

Use the Airtable node to insert the parsed data into the designated Airtable table. Ensure proper mapping of fields like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

### Save and Execute

Save the workflow and activate it to ensure weather data is fetched and stored automatically every day.
