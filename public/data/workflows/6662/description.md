**How it works**

This workflow helps you stay on top of your inbox without constant interruptions. Every afternoon, it automatically:

- Fetches all emails received in your inbox throughout the current day.

- Intelligently summarizes the key content of these emails using AI, providing a concise overview.

- Compiles these summaries into a single, organized digest.

- Sends you a single email containing the aggregated summary of your day's correspondence.

Efficiently review your daily communications and focus on what truly matters, all in one convenient digest!

**Set up steps**

Setting up this workflow is straightforward and typically takes around 10-15 minutes. You'll need to:

- Authenticate your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail).

- Obtain API keys for your preferred AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).

- Specify the email address where you want to receive the digest.

All detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.
