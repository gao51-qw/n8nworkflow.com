    "description": "**How it works**\n\nThis workflow helps you stay on top of your inbox without constant interruptions. Every afternoon, it automatically:\n\n- Fetches all emails received in your inbox throughout the current day.\n\n- Intelligently summarizes the key content of these emails using AI, providing a concise overview.\n\n- Compiles these summaries into a single, organized digest.\n\n- Sends you a single email containing the aggregated summary of your day's correspondence.\n\nEfficiently review your daily communications and focus on what truly matters, all in one convenient digest!\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nSetting up this workflow is straightforward and typically takes around 10-15 minutes. You'll need to:\n\n- Authenticate your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail).\n\n- Obtain API keys for your preferred AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).\n\n- Specify the email address where you want to receive the digest.\n\nAll detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.",
