  "description": "# Description (How it works)\nThis workflow keeps your Zalo Official Account access token valid and easy to reuse across other flows—no external server required.\n\n**High-level steps**\n1. **Scheduled refresh** runs on an interval to renew the access token before it expires.  \n2. **Static Data cache** (global) stores access/refresh tokens + expiries for reuse by any downstream node.  \n3. **OAuth exchange** calls Zalo OAuth v4 with your `app_id` and `secret_key` to get a fresh access token.  \n4. **Immediate output** returns the current access token to the next nodes after each refresh.  \n5. **Operational webhooks** include:\n   - A **reset** webhook to clear the cache when rotating credentials or testing.\n   - A **token peek** webhook to read the currently cached token for other services.\n\n# Setup steps (estimated time ~8–15 minutes)\n1. **Collect Zalo credentials (2–3 min):** Obtain `app_id`, `secret_key`, and a valid `refresh_token`.  \n2. **Import & activate workflow (1–2 min):** Import the JSON into n8n and activate it.  \n3. **Wire inputs (2–3 min):** Point the “Set Refresh Token and App ID” node to your env vars (or paste values for a quick test).  \n4. **Adjust schedule & secure webhooks (2–3 min):** Tune the run interval to your token TTL; protect the reset/peek endpoints (e.g., secret param or IP allowlist).  \n5. **Test (1–2 min):** Execute once to populate Static Data; optionally try the token peek and reset webhooks to confirm behavior.\n",
