  "description": "👔 Who is this for?\n- Entrepreneurs and startup founders preparing for investors  \n- Business consultants drafting complete client plans  \n- Strategy teams building long-term business models  \n- Accelerators, incubators, or pitch trainers  \n\n❓ What problem does this workflow solve?\nWriting a full business plan takes days of work, multiple tools, and often gets stuck in messy docs or slides. This template automates every major section, generating a clean, detailed, and professional business plan with AI in just minutes.\n\n⚙️ What this workflow does\n- Starts with a chat message asking for your business idea or startup concept  \n- Passes the idea through **83 intelligent agents**, each handling a full business plan chapter:\n  - Executive Summary  \n  - Problem & Solution  \n  - Product Description  \n  - Market Research  \n  - Competitor Analysis  \n  - Business Model  \n  - Marketing Strategy (includes guerrilla ideas)  \n  - Operational Plan  \n  - Financial Plan  \n  - Team & Advisors  \n  - Roadmap  \n  - Conclusion & Next Steps  \n- Each section uses tailored prompts and business logic  \n- Combines all outputs into a structured, professional Markdown file  \n- Final result: a ready-to-export business plan in seconds  \n\n🛠️ Setup\n1. Import this template into your n8n instance  \n2. Replace the “LLM Chat Model” node with your preferred model (Ollama, GPT-4, etc.)  \n3. Start from the chat input node — describe your startup or idea  \n4. Wait for all agents to finish  \n5. Download the final Business plan file \n\n🤖 LLM Flexibility (Choose Your Model)\n- Supports:\n  - OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-3.5)\n  - Ollama (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.)\n  - Any compatible N8N chat model  \n- To change the model, just replace the “Language Model” node — no other updates required  \n\n\n📌 Notes\n- All nodes are clearly named by function (e.g., “Market Research Generator”)  \n- Sticky notes included for clarity  \n- Generates high-quality plans suitable for VCs or accelerators  \n- Modular: you can turn off or reorder any chapter  \n\n📩 Need help?\nEmail: sinamirshafiee@gmail.com  \nHappy to support setup, LLM switching, or custom section development.",
