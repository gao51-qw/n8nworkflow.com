  "description": "This workflow automates the process of scraping, analyzing, and storing real estate data from Zillow using Apify, OpenAI, and Google Sheets.\n\nIt begins by running an Apify Actor that extracts live property details such as price, location, and key features. The data is then cleaned and processed before being analyzed by an AI model that assigns an investment potential score (1–10).\n\nTo maintain reliable results, the AI only scores properties that include all required fields — for example, listings missing price or description data are automatically skipped. This ensures that only complete and accurate information is evaluated.\n\nFinally, all valid results are appended or updated in a Google Sheet, creating a central, always-up-to-date property database for future analysis.\n\nIdeal for real estate investors, analysts, and data-driven agencies, this template provides a fully automated loop for property collection, evaluation, and reporting — all in one flow.\n\nTools used: Apify, OpenAI, Google Sheets, n8n![Captura de pantalla 20251015 202643.png](fileId:2966)",
