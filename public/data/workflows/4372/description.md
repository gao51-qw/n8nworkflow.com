# ⚡ AI Copywriter Pro: Instant Ad Copy & CTA Generator

Transform product details into compelling marketing copy in seconds. This intelligent n8n workflow takes basic product information and generates professional ad copy with powerful calls-to-action using GPT-4, then distributes the results to your team via Slack or stores them in Airtable for future use.

## 🚀 How It Works

This streamlined 4-step automation delivers professional marketing copy instantly:

**Step 1: Simple Form Input**
Users submit basic product information through a clean web form - just product name and key features required.

**Step 2: AI-Powered Generation**
The workflow sends product details to GPT-4 with a specialized copywriting prompt that creates:
- Compelling 2-sentence ad copy optimized for conversions
- 3 powerful call-to-action phrases with different urgency levels
- Professional tone tailored for marketing campaigns

**Step 3: Structured Processing**
The AI response is automatically parsed into clean, labeled fields ready for immediate use across marketing channels.

**Step 4: Multi-Channel Distribution**
Generated content is simultaneously:
- Posted to your designated Slack channel for team review
- Logged in Airtable for campaign tracking and reuse
