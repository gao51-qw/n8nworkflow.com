  "description": "This n8n workflow automatically fetches all interview events scheduled for today from a specified Google Calendar and sends a personalized email to each interviewer. The email contains a formatted HTML table listing their interview details, including meeting times, Google Meet links, and attendees with their response status.\n\nThis ensures all interviewers are informed daily at **8:00 AM IST** without any manual coordination.\n\n## Who’s it for\n- **Interviewers** who want a quick morning packet instead of opening multiple calendar tabs.\n- **Recruiters/coordinators** who need a reliable, zero‑friction daily brief for interviewers.\n- **Teams** that paste CV/notes links directly into calendar events (no file search required).\n\n## How it works\n1. **Cron** triggers daily at **08:00 IST**.\n2. **Google Calendar** reads today’s events from the **Interviews** calendar.\n3. A **Code** step parses each event to identify interviewers and extract candidate details, meeting link, and any `CV:` / `Notes:` links from the description and create a table to share via Gmail.\n4. A **grouping** step compiles a per‑interviewer list for the day.\n5. **Email (Gmail)** sends one digest to interviewer.\n\n## How to set up\n1. Ensure all interviews are scheduled on the Google Calendar named **Interviews** and that interviewers are added as **attendees**.\n2. Add CV: &lt;url&gt; and Notes: &lt;url&gt; in the **event description** when available.\n3. Import the workflow and add credentials:\n   - **Google Calendar** (OAuth)\n   - **SMTP/Gmail** for sending the email digests\n4. Keep the default **08:00 IST** schedule in the Cron node or adjust as needed.\n\n## Requirements\n- Google Workspace account with access to the **Interviews** calendar.\n- Gmail sender account for digests (App Password if using 2FA).\n- n8n instance (cloud or self‑hosted).\n\n## Steps\n\n### Trigger Schedule\n\n* **Node:** `Schedule Trigger`\n* **Purpose:** Starts the workflow daily at **8:00 AM**.\n\n---\n\n### Fetch Interview Events\n\n* **Node:** `Google Calendar(Fetch Interview Events)`\n* **Purpose:** Retrieves all events (interviews) from the configured calendar.\n* **Output:** Event details including summary, time, and organizer email.\n\n---\n\n### Group & Format Schedule\n\n* **Node:** `HTML Table` (JavaScript Code Node)\n* **Purpose:** Groups events by interviewer email and generates an HTML schedule table.\n* **Output:** Formatted fields:\n\n  * `interviewer_email`\n  * `subject`\n  * `htmlContent`\n\n---\n\n### Send Personalized Emails\n\n* **Node:** `Gmail`\n* **Purpose:** Sends the formatted interview schedule to each interviewer’s email address.\n* **Send To:** Dynamically set using `={{ $json.interviewer_email }}`\n* **Subject:** `\"Interview Reminder\"`\n* **Body:** `={{ $json.htmlContent }}` (HTML)\n\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- **Parsing rules:** If your event titles follow a pattern (e.g., `Onsite – {Candidate} – {Role}`), tweak the regex in the Code node.\n- **Attendee logic:** Refine how interviewers are detected (e.g., filter only `accepted` responses, or include `tentative`).\n- **Digest format:** Adjust table columns/order, or add role/team labels from the title.\n- **Schedule:** Duplicate the Cron for regional time zones or add a midday refresh.\n\n## Add-ons to level up the Workflow with additional nodes\n- **Reminder pings:** Add 10‑minute pre‑interview reminders via Email or Slack/Teams.\n- **Conflict alerts:** Flag if an interviewer is double‑booked within a 15‑minute window.\n- **Feedback follow‑up:** After the scheduled time, DM or email a standardized feedback form link.\n- **Drive search (optional):** If you later want auto‑attach CVs, add a Google Drive search step (by candidate name) in a designated folder.\n\n## Common troubleshooting points\n- **No events found:** Confirm the calendar name is **Interviews** and that events exist **today**.\n- **Missing links:** If CV/notes links aren’t in the email, add `CV:`/`Notes:` links to the event description.\n- **Email not sent:** Verify SMTP credentials, from‑address permissions, and any sending limits.\n- **Time mismatch:** Confirm workflow timezone and Calendar times are set to **Asia/Kolkata** (or adjust).\n\n## A short note\nIf you need help tailoring the parsing rules, adjusting the schedule or troubleshooting any step, feel free to reach out we will happy to help.",
