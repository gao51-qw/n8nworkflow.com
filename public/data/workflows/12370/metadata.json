  "description": "# WooCommerce VIP Customer Automation\n\nThis workflow automatically identifies VIP customers from your WooCommerce store based on their total spending and number of completed orders. It pulls new orders on a schedule, filters valid transactions, groups customers, calculates their VIP tier, stores them into Airtable and notifies your team in Slack.It removes all manual checking and ensures your team instantly knows when a high-value customer places an order.\n\n### Quick Start – Implementation Steps\n\n1.  Add your WooCommerce store domain and API credentials inside n8n.\n2.  Configure Airtable and Slack credentials.\n3.  Adjust VIP rules (lifetime spend or total orders) if needed.\n4.  Activate the workflow — it will automatically detect VIPs and alert your team.\n    \n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow fully automates VIP customer detection for WooCommerce stores. Every few minutes, it retrieves new orders via WooCommerce API. It filters only processing or completed orders and extracts essential fields such as customer ID, customer name order total and timestamps.\n\nThe workflow then groups orders by customer to ensure duplicate orders don’t inflate metrics. For each customer, it fetches their complete order history, calculates lifetime value, counts total paid orders and assigns a VIP tier (Platinum, Gold or Silver).\n\nOnce a customer qualifies, their details are saved into Airtable for tracking. A Slack message is simultaneously sent to inform your team so they can take immediate action — such as providing priority support, follow-up messages or special offers.\n\nThis system runs completely on its own and keeps customer insights up-to-date without manual checks.\n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n*   WooCommerce store owners\n*   Customer support teams\n*   Marketing teams\n*   CRM & retention specialists\n*   eCommerce operations teams\n*   Businesses wanting automated VIP alerts\n    \n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\nYou will need:\n\n*   A running **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)\n*   A **WooCommerce store** with API keys\n*   A **Slack workspace** with API permissions\n*   An **Airtable Base** to store VIP customers\n*   Basic understanding of WooCommerce and Airtable fields\n    \n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Scheduled Trigger** – Runs every few minutes to check for new orders.\n2.  **Domain Setup** – Assigns the WooCommerce store domain used across API calls.\n3.  **Fetch Orders** – Retrieves all orders from WooCommerce.\n4.  **Filter Valid Orders** – Only keeps completed or processing orders.\n5.  **Format & Clean Data** – Extracts only key order details.\n6.  **Deduplicate Customers** – Only the first order per customer is processed.\n7.  **Fetch Order History** – Gets lifetime order history for each customer.\n8.  **Calculate VIP Tier** – Determines Platinum/Gold/Silver based on spend or order count.\n9.  **Filter VIP Only** – Removes customers who do not qualify.\n10.  **Save to Airtable** – Creates/updates VIP records.\n11.  **Notify Team on Slack** – Sends VIP alerts instantly.\n    \n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1.  Import this workflow JSON into n8n.\n2.  Enter your WooCommerce API credentials in the HTTP Request nodes.\n3.  Update the **wc\\_domain** value in the “Set WooCommerce Domain” node.\n4.  Configure Airtable credentials and select your Base + Table.\n5.  Set your Slack channel ID inside the Slack node.\n6.  Adjust VIP rules inside the “Calculate VIP Tier” code node if needed.\n7.
