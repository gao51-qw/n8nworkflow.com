# Identify and notify WooCommerce VIP customers with Airtable and Slack

> # WooCommerce VIP Customer Automation

This workflow automatically identifies VIP customers from your WooCommerce store based on their total spending and number of completed orders. It pulls new orders on a schedule, filters valid transactions, groups customers, calculates their VIP tier, stores them into Airtable and notifies your team in Slack.It removes all manual checking and ensures your team instantly knows when a high-value customer places an order.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1.  Add your WooCommerce store domain and API credentials inside n8n.
2.  Configure Airtable and Slack credentials.
3.  Adjust VIP rules (lifetime spend or total orders) if needed.
4.  Activate the workflow — it will automatically detect VIPs and alert your team.
    

## What It Does

This workflow fully automates VIP customer detection for WooCommerce stores. Every few minutes, it retrieves new orders via WooCommerce API. It filters only processing or completed orders and extracts essential fields such as customer ID, customer name order total and timestamps.

The workflow then groups orders by customer to ensure duplicate orders don’t inflate metrics. For each customer, it fetches their complete order history, calculates lifetime value, counts total paid orders and assigns a VIP tier (Platinum, Gold or Silver).

Once a customer qualifies, their details are saved into Airtable for tracking. A Slack message is simultaneously sent to inform your team so they can take immediate action — such as providing priority support, follow-up messages or special offers.

This system runs completely on its own and keeps customer insights up-to-date without manual checks.

## Who’s It For

This workflow is ideal for:

*   WooCommerce store owners
*   Customer support teams
