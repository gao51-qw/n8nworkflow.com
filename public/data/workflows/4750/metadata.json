  "description": "## Why\nIf you need to use n8n to connect to service providers of yours,  some of which happen to  rely on firewall white-listing as part of their access control, you'll need to determine or verify the public IP addresses of your n8n instance(s).\n\n## How does it work\n* The webhook, upon invocation, will use **Http Request** node to request public IP address information from ++api.ipify.org++ in json format, for 10 times, then **aggregate** results to an array.\n  * The reason to repeat, is to get all the potential public IP addresses of your n8n instance.\n  * Often than not, enterprises or network providers deploy at least a pair of gateway devices at the border for redundancy.\n* built-in array functions in a javascript expression are used to **pluck** all the values under 'ip' key, and to dedup to an array as response body.\n\n## How to set it up\n* import the workflow\n* set up your own header-auth credential\n* update the workflow to use the new credential\n* test or activate workflow as usual.\n\n## example invocation\n```\n$ curl -H \"api-key: super-long-api-token\" http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/4879bc79-d6f8-48df-bfe4-613366c7f399\n[\"88.88.88.66\", \"88.88.88.88\"]\n```\n\n",
