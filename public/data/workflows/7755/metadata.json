  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nAutomation enthusiasts, content creators, or social media managers who post article-based threads to Bluesky and want to automate the process end-to-end.\n\n### What problem is this solving?\n\nManual content repackaging and posting can be repetitive and time-consuming. This workflow automates the process from capturing article URLs (via Telegram or RSS) to scraping content, transforming it into a styled thread, and posting on Bluesky platform.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n* Listens on **Telegram** or fetches from **RSS feeds** (AI Trends, Machine Learning Mastery, Technology Review).\n* Extracts content from URLs using **JinaAI**.\n* Converts the article into a neat, scroll-stopping thread via **LangChain + Gemini / OpenAI ChatGPT**.\n* Splits the thread into multiple posts. The first post is published with “Create a Post”, while subsequent posts are replies.\n* Adds short delays between posting to avoid rate limits.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Add credentials for **Telegram Bot API**, **JinaAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Bluesky App Password**.\n2. Add or customize RSS feeds if needed \n3. Test with a sample URL to validate posting sequence.\n\n### How to customize\n\n* Swap out RSS feeds or trigger sources.\n* Modify prompt templates or thread formatting rules in the LangChain/Gemini node.\n* Adjust wait times or content parsing logic.\n* Replace Bluesky with another posting target if desired.\n\n\nMade by: **[Khaisa Studio](https://khaisa.studio?utm_source=n8nofficial)**\nNeed customs workflows? **[Contact Me!](https://khmuhtadin/contact)**\n",
