### Who is this for?

Automation enthusiasts, content creators, or social media managers who post article-based threads to Bluesky and want to automate the process end-to-end.

### What problem is this solving?

Manual content repackaging and posting can be repetitive and time-consuming. This workflow automates the process from capturing article URLs (via Telegram or RSS) to scraping content, transforming it into a styled thread, and posting on Bluesky platform.

### What this workflow does

* Listens on **Telegram** or fetches from **RSS feeds** (AI Trends, Machine Learning Mastery, Technology Review).
* Extracts content from URLs using **JinaAI**.
* Converts the article into a neat, scroll-stopping thread via **LangChain + Gemini / OpenAI ChatGPT**.
* Splits the thread into multiple posts. The first post is published with “Create a Post”, while subsequent posts are replies.
* Adds short delays between posting to avoid rate limits.

### Setup

1. Add credentials for **Telegram Bot API**, **JinaAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Bluesky App Password**.
2. Add or customize RSS feeds if needed 
3. Test with a sample URL to validate posting sequence.

### How to customize

* Swap out RSS feeds or trigger sources.
* Modify prompt templates or thread formatting rules in the LangChain/Gemini node.
* Adjust wait times or content parsing logic.
* Replace Bluesky with another posting target if desired.
