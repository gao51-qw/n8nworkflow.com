# 📌 HubSpot Lead Enrichment with Bright Data MCP

![Screenshot 20250603 at 1.24.49 PM.png](fileId:1436)

This template enables natural-language-driven automation using Bright Data's MCP tools, triggered directly by **new leads in HubSpot**. It dynamically extracts and executes the right tool based on lead context—powered by AI and configurable in **N8N**.

---

## ❓ What Problem Does This Solve?

Manual lead enrichment is slow, inconsistent, and drains valuable time. This solution automates the process using a no-code workflow that connects HubSpot, Bright Data MCP, and an AI agent—without requiring scripts or technical skills. Perfect for marketing, sales, and RevOps teams.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

To use this template, you’ll need:

- A self-hosted or cloud instance of **N8N**
- A **Bright Data MCP API token**
- A valid **OpenAI API key** (or compatible AI model)
- A **HubSpot account**
- Either a **Private App token** or **OAuth credentials** for HubSpot
- Basic familiarity with N8N workflows

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Authentication in HubSpot

#### 🔐 Option 1: Use a Private App Token (Simple Setup)
1. Log in to your [HubSpot account](https://app.hubspot.com).
2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Private Apps**.
3. Create a new Private App with the following scopes:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.companies.read` (optional)
4. Copy the **Access Token**.
5. In N8N, create a credential for HubSpot App Token and paste the app token in the field.
6. Go back to Hubspot Private App settings to setup a webhook.
   - Copy the url in your workflow's Webhook node and paste it here.

#### 🔁 Option 2: Use OAuth (Advanced + Secure)
1. In HubSpot, go to **Settings → Integrations → Apps → Create App**.
2. Set your Redirect URL to match your N8N OAuth2 redirect path.
3. Choose scopes like:
   -  `crm.objects.companies.read`
   -  `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   -  `crm.objects.deals.read`
   -  `crm.schemas.companies.read`
   -  `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
   -  `crm.schemas.deals.read`
   -  `crm.objects.contacts.write` *(conditionally required)*
4. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
5. Copy the App ID and the developer API key
6. In N8N, create a credential for HubSpot Developer API and paste those info from previous step.
7. Attach these credentials to the HubSpot node in N8N.

### 2. Setup and obtain API token and other necessary information from Bright Data

   In your Bright Data account, obtain the following information:
   - API token
   - Web Unlocker zone name (optional)
   - Browser API username and password string separated by colon (optional)
***
### 3. Host SSE server from STDIO command
   The methods below will allow you to receive SSE (Server-Sent Events) from Bright Data MCP via a local Supergateway or Smithery

   ******

   ***Method 1: Run Supergateway in a separate web service (Recommended)***

   This method will work for both cloud version and self-hosted N8N.

   Signup to any cloud services of your choice (DigitalOcean, Heroku, Hetzner, Render, etc.).

   ##### For NPM based installation:

   - Create a new web service.
   - Choose Node.js as runtime environment and setup a custom server without repository.
   - In your server’s settings to define environment variables or .env file, add:
`API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token
WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name
BROWSER_AUTH=optional_browser_auth`
   - Paste the following text as a start command: `npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp" --port 8000 --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --ssePath /sse --messagePath /message`
   - Deploy it and copy the web server URL, then append `/sse` into it.
   - Your SSE server should now be accessible at: `https://your_server_url/sse`

   ##### For Docker based installation:
   - Create a new web service.
   - Choose Docker as the runtime environment.
   - Set up your Docker environment by pulling the necessary images or creating a custom Dockerfile.
   - In your server’s settings to define environment variables or .env file, add:
`API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token
WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name
BROWSER_ZONE=optional_browser_zone_name`
    - Use the following Docker command to run Supergateway: `docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 supercorp/supergateway \
    --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp /" \
    --port 8000`
   - Deploy it and copy the web server URL, then append `/sse` into it.
   - Your SSE server should now be accessible at: `https://your_server_url/sse`

   For more installation guides, please refer to [https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git).
   ******

   ***Method 2: Run Supergateway in the same web service as the N8N instance***

   This method will only work for self-hosted N8N.

   ##### a. Set Required Environment Variables

   In your server's settings to define environment variables or `.env` file, add:

   ```
   API_TOKEN=your_brightdata_api_token
   WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE=optional_zone_name
   BROWSER_ZONE=optional_browser_zone_name
   ```

   ##### b. Run Supergateway in Background

   ```bash
   npx -y supergateway --stdio "npx -y @brightdata/mcp" --port 8000 --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --ssePath /sse --messagePath /message
   ```
   Use the command above to execute it through the cloud shell or set it as a pre-deploy command.


   Your SSE server should now be accessible at:  
   `http://localhost:8000/sse`

 
   For more installation guides, please refer to [https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway.git).

   ***

   ***Method 3: Configure via Smithery.ai* (Easiest)**
If you don't want additional setup and want to test it right away, follow these instructions:

   Visit [https://smithery.ai/server/@luminati-io/brightdata-mcp/tools](https://smithery.ai/server/@luminati-io/brightdata-mcp/tools) to:
   * Signup (if you are new to Smithery)
   * Create an API key
   * Define environment variables via a profile
   * Retrieve your SSE server HTTP URL


### 4. Connect Google Sheets to N8N

- Ensure your **Google Sheet**:
  - Contains columns like `row_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `status`.
  - Is shared with your N8N service account (or connected via OAuth)

- In **N8N**:
  - Add a **Google Sheets Trigger** node
  - Set it to watch for new rows in your lead sheet

---

### 5. Import and Configure the N8N Workflow

- Import the provided JSON workflow into N8N
- Update nodes with your credentials:
  - **Hubspot**: Add your API key or connect it via OAuth.
  - **Google Sheets Trigger**: Link to your actual sheet
  - **OpenAI Node**: Add your API key
  - **Bright Data Tool Execution**: Add Bright Data token and SSE URL

---

## 🔄 How It Works
- New contact in Hubspot or a new row is added to the Google Sheet
- N8N triggers the workflow
- AI agent classifies the task (e.g., “Find LinkedIn”, “Get company info”)
- The relevant MCP tool is called
- Results are appended back to the sheet or routed to another destination
- Rerun the specific record by specifying status "needs more enrichment", or leaving it blank. 

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- **B2B Lead Enrichment** – Add missing fields (title, domain, social profiles)
- **Email Intelligence** – Validate and enrich based on email
- **Market Research** – Pull company or contact data on demand
- **CRM Auto-fill** – Push enriched leads to tools like HubSpot or Salesforce

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Prompt Tuning** – Adjust how the AI interprets input data
- **Column Mapping** – Customize which fields to pull from the sheet
- **Tool Logic** – Add retries, fallback tools, or confidence-based routing
- **Destination Output** – Integrate with CRMs, Slack, or webhook endpoints

---

## ✅ Summary

This template turns a **Google Sheet into an AI-powered lead enrichment engine**. By combining Bright Data’s tools with a natural language AI agent, your team can automate repetitive tasks and scale lead ops—without writing code.

Just add a row, and let the workflow do the rest.
