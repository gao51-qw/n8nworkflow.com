  "description": "## This n8n template automates email labeling using AI-enhanced classification and intelligent routing\n\nGmail users report spending significant time manually sorting email, so this tool helps alleviate that burden.\n\n## How it works\n- Gmail Trigger monitors unread emails every 2 minutes\n- Once an email arrives, the content is extracted with HTML cleaning\n- AI Agent (the node is set for Chat GPT-4) is used for classification & entity extraction\n- A Structured Output Parser parses the email to JSON\n- A 9-way category routing system categorizes the email (Inquiry, Support, Newsletter, Marketing, Personal, Urgent, Spam, Invoice, Meeting)\n- Gmail auto-labeling is used for each category\n- Google Sheets is used for logging (the main log that includes all emails and  an error log which are emails that cannot be classified)\n- Slack alerts are generated for high-priority/urgent emails\n- Error handling is done with separate error logging in Google Sheets\n\n## How to use\n- Set up credentials for Google Gmail, LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), Google Sheets, and Slack\n- Modify the categories as needed per user preference\n\n## Requirements\n- Gmail \n- Any LLM like ChatGPT or Google Gemini\n- Google Drive with Google Sheets is optional for logging and error handling\n- Slack is optional for high-priority messages",
