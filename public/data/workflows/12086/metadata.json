It handles proxies, anti-bot protection, JavaScript rendering, retries, and global IP rotation—so you can focus on data, not scraping complexity.\n**Why Decodo**\n- Managed **Web Scraping API** with anti-bot bypass & high success rates  \n- Works with JS-heavy sites; outputs JSON/HTML/CSV  \n- Easy integration (Python, Node.js, cURL) for eCommerce, SERP, social & general web data\n**🎟️ Special Discount**\nUse coupon **`TRUNG`** to get the **Advanced Scraping API** plan — ~**23,000 requests for ~$5**.\n\n## Who this workflow is for\nFor **DevOps, SRE, IT Ops, and Platform teams** running production traffic behind Cloudflare who need reliable incident awareness without alert fatigue.\nUse it if you want:\n- Continuous Cloudflare incident monitoring\n- Clear severity-based routing\n- Automatic escalation into JIRA\n- Clean Slack & Telegram notifications\n- Deduplicated, noise-controlled alerts\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow polls the **Cloudflare Status API**, detects unresolved incidents, scores their impact, and routes them to the right channels.\nHigh-impact incidents are escalated to JIRA.\nLower-impact updates are notified (or skipped) to reduce noise.\n## How it works (high level)\n1. Runs on a fixed schedule (e.g. every 5 minutes)\n2. Fetches current Cloudflare incidents\n3. Stops early if no active issues exist\n4. Normalizes and scores incidents (severity, impact, affected service)\n5. Deduplicates previously-alerted incidents\n6. Builds human-readable notification payloads\n7. Routes by impact:\n   - **High** → create JIRA incident + notify\n   - **Low** → notify or suppress\n8. Sends alerts to Slack and Telegram\n## Requirements\n- Decoco Scrapper API credential\n- n8n (self-hosted or Cloud)\n- Cloudflare Status API (public)\n- Slack bot (`chat:write`)\n- Telegram bot + chat ID\n- JIRA project with issue-create permission\n- Optional LLM credentials (summarization/classification)\n## Notes\n- All secrets are stored in **n8n Credentials**\n- Workflow is **idempotent** and safe to rerun\n- No assumptions about root cause or remediation\nBuilt for production-grade incident visibility with **n8n**.\n",
