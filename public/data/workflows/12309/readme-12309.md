# Sync LinkedIn profile visitors into HubSpot CRM leads with ConnectSafely.ai and Apify

> # Sync LinkedIn Profile Visitors to HubSpot CRM

## Who's it for

This workflow is built for sales professionals, recruiters, founders, and marketers who want to automatically capture LinkedIn profile visitors and convert them into actionable CRM leads. Perfect for anyone tired of manually checking who viewed their profile, copying data one by one, and losing warm leads because they never made it into your pipeline.

If you're running outbound sales, recruiting talent, building partnerships, or simply want to know who's checking you out on LinkedIn, this automation captures every visitor and enriches them with full professional data before syncing to your CRM.

## How it works

The workflow automatically syncs your LinkedIn profile visitors to HubSpot CRM with enriched professional data.

**The process flow:**
1. Scheduled trigger runs weekly (or manually) to fetch recent visitors
2. ConnectSafely.ai API retrieves all profile visitors from the past 7 days
3. Splits visitors into individual records for processing
4. Apify actor enriches each visitor with complete LinkedIn profile data (email, company, title, location)
5. Email validation filters contacts - only those with valid emails proceed
6. HubSpot integration creates or updates contacts with full enriched information
7. Loop continues until all visitors are processed

## Customization

### Time Range Adjustment

Edit the JSON body in the **Fetch Profile Visitors** node to change the lookback period:

```json
{"timeRange":"past_7_days","start":0,"fetchAll":true}
```

Options:
- `past_7_days` - Last week's visitors (default)
- `past_30_days` - Last month's visitors
- `past_90_days` - Last quarter's visitors

### Additional HubSpot Fields

The **Create HubSpot Contact** node maps these fields by default:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Job Title
- Company Name
- City
- Country
- Street Address
- LinkedIn URL
- Lead Status (set to "NEW")

To add more fields:
1. Open the **Create HubSpot Contact** node
2. Click **Add Field** under Additional Fields
3. Map Apify output fields to HubSpot properties

### Different CRM Integration

To use a different CRM instead of HubSpot:
1. Delete the **Create HubSpot Contact** node
2. Add your CRM node (Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, etc.)
3. Map the enriched fields to your CRM's contact properties
4. Connect it to the "Has Valid Email" true output

### Add Slack Notifications

Want to get notified when high-value visitors are captured?
1. Add a Slack node after **Create HubSpot Contact**
2. Filter for specific job titles or companies
3. Send a message to your sales channel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: No visitors returned from API
- **Solution**: Ensure your LinkedIn account is connected in ConnectSafely.ai dashboard and has had recent profile views

**Issue**: Apify enrichment returning empty results
- **Solution**: Verify the LinkedIn URL format is correct (should be full URL like `https://www.linkedin.com/in/username`). Check your Apify actor is running properly.

**Issue**: "Profile not found" errors
- **Solution**: Some LinkedIn profiles may be private or have restricted visibility. These will be skipped automatically.

**Issue**: HubSpot contact not created
- **Solution**: Check that your HubSpot App Token has `crm.objects.contacts.write` scope enabled

**Issue**: Duplicate contacts in HubSpot
- **Solution**: HubSpot uses email as the unique identifier. The node is configured to "Create or Update" so duplicates should be updated, not created. Verify the email field is mapping correctly.

**Issue**: Rate limit errors from Apify
- **Solution**: Add a Wait node after the loop with 2-5 second delays between enrichment calls

**Issue**: Missing email addresses for most visitors
- **Solution**: This is normal - enrichment typically finds emails for 60-70% of profiles. Consider adding LinkedIn URL as a fallback identifier in your CRM.
