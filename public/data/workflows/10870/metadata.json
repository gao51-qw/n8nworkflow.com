  "description": "## Who's it for\n\nThis template is designed for content creators, podcasters, businesses, and researchers who need to transcribe long audio recordings that exceed OpenAI Whisper's 25 MB file size limit (~20 minutes of audio).\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow combines n8n, FileFlows, and OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio files of any length:\n\n1. User uploads an MP3 file through a web form and provides an email address\n2. n8n splits the file into 4 MiB chunks and uploads them to FileFlows\n3. FileFlows uses FFmpeg to segment the audio into 15-minute chunks (safely under the 25 MB API limit)\n4. Each segment is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper API (configured for French by default)\n5. All transcriptions are merged into a single text file\n6. The complete transcription is automatically emailed to the user\n\n**Processing time:** Typically 10-15 minutes for a 1-hour audio file.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- FileFlows with Docker and FFmpeg installed\n- OpenAI API key (Whisper API access)\n- Gmail account for email delivery\n- Network access between n8n and FileFlows\n\n## Setup\n\nComplete setup instructions, including FileFlows workflow import, credentials configuration, and storage setup, are provided in the workflow's sticky notes.\n\n## Cost\n\nOpenAI Whisper API: $0.006 per minute. A 1-hour recording costs approximately $0.36.",
