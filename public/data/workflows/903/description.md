This **n8n workflow template** uses **uProc's "Get Email by Domain, Firstname and Lastname" tool** to discover a professional email address, and then sends that email to a **Telegram channel**.

&gt; ⚠️ *Note: You must set up your **uProc credentials (Email + API Key)** from the [**Integration settings**](https://app.uproc.io/#/settings/integration) before running this workflow.*

---

### 🚀 **What It Does**

- Uses user-provided data: **first name**, **last name**, and **company domain**
- Calls **uProc** to discover the most likely email address for that person
- Sends the discovered email and confidence level to a **Telegram group**

---

### 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Setup**

1. **Add uProc Credentials**  
   Go to the [uProc integration page](https://app.uproc.io/#/settings/integration) and copy your **email and API key**.  
   Add them as credentials in your n8n instance.

2. **Set Tool Parameters**  
   - Use the **Set node** to define:
     - `firstname`: First name of the person
     - `lastname`: Last name of the person
     - `domain`: Their company domain

3. **Replace the Set Node (Optional)**  
   You can dynamically fetch the `firstname`, `lastname`, and `domain` from other sources like:
   - **Google Sheets**
   - **MySQL or Postgres**
   - **Webhook or Form submissions**

4. **Run the Workflow**  
   Trigger the flow manually or integrate it with a larger automation.
