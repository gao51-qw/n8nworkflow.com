  "title": "Email outreach drafter based on HubSpot data",
  "description": "This n8n template turns a small, targeted HubSpot list into tailored outreach. It scans each contact’s recent Gmail conversations, builds a lightweight persona with AI (tone, goals, pain points, decision style), then drafts a concise sales email aligned to your offer—saved to Gmail as a reviewable draft.\n\nPerfect for SDRs and founders who want personalization at scale without writing from scratch.\n\nThis template was originally created by [Jim Le](https://n8n.io/creators/jimleuk/).\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n* **Manual trigger** starts a controlled run.\n* **HubSpot search** pulls a focused list of contacts (e.g., `hs_buying_role = DECISION_MAKER`).\n* **Batch loop** processes contacts one by one.\n* **Gmail fetch** grabs up to 20 recent threads from each contact.\n* **AI persona extraction** (Information Extractor + Gemini) analyzes messages to capture:\n\n  * decision-making style, communication preferences, goals/motivations\n  * pain points, work style, personality traits, buying behavior, values, market awareness\n* **Variables node** sets core fields (first name, last name, email) and the **offer** you want to pitch.\n* **AI email generation** (Gemini) mirrors the contact’s tone and priorities; outputs **subject** + **HTML body**.\n* **Gmail draft** is created for the contact so a rep can skim, tweak, and send.\n\n---\n\n## How to use\n\n1. **Connect HubSpot** on the “Get Contacts” node and refine the filter to your segment.\n2. **Connect Gmail** on both read and draft nodes (same account recommended).\n3. **Add Gemini key** to both Gemini nodes.\n4. In **Variables**, update `product_to_sell` with your offer and confirm the contact field mappings.\n5. (Optional) Tweak the **persona attributes** or the **email prompt** for tone/length/CTA.\n6. Click **Test workflow**. Review drafts in Gmail, edit if needed, then send.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **HubSpot** (OAuth2) for contact targeting\n* **Gmail** (read + draft)\n* **Google Gemini** (API key) for persona + copy generation\n\n---\n\n## Notes & customization\n\n* **Tighter targeting:** Change the HubSpot filter (e.g., industry, territory, lifecycle stage) to keep the list small and measurable.\n* **Richer inputs:** Increase Gmail `limit` or include received/sent filters to capture more context (mind rate limits).\n* **Brand voice:** Add a short style guide to the email generator’s system prompt (e.g., sentence length, jargon rules, sign-off).\n* **Offer variants:** Replace `product_to_sell` per segment, or branch by industry to load different value props.\n* **Compliance & privacy:** Limit stored outputs to essentials; avoid copying sensitive content from threads verbatim.\n* **Auto-send option:** Swap the draft step for “send email” if you want hands-off delivery for known segments.",
