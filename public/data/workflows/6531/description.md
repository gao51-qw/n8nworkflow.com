## Overview

Automate your entire LinkedIn content machine — from research and image generation to scheduling and posting — with this AI-powered workflow.

This workflow pulls in past content ideas, researches new ones using Perplexity, generates a new post (with image) using your brand's voice and style, saves the output to Google Sheets, and auto-posts twice a week to LinkedIn. It’s perfect for founders, creators, and marketers who want to stay consistent on LinkedIn without manually writing or designing every post.

### Who’s it for

- Solo founders or marketers building a LinkedIn presence  
- Content creators growing their audience  
- Agencies managing client content calendars  
- Anyone who wants to post consistently without spending hours on content  

### How it works

- Pulls old ideas from a Google Sheet  
- Schedules content creation using n8n’s cron node  
- Uses Perplexity to research current topics and trends  
- Feeds the data into an AI agent (like Claude or GPT) to generate post copy  
- Creates a branded image using a reference style and OpenAI’s image model  
- Saves post content + image URL into Google Sheets  
- Twice a week, selects one ready post, downloads the image, and publishes it to LinkedIn

### How to set up

1. Add your Google Sheet ID and column names for posts  
2. Connect your OpenAI (or Claude) and Perplexity API keys  
3. Upload a brand-style reference image to Google Drive  
4. Configure your LinkedIn account and connect the node  
5. Adjust the cron schedule for both post creation and auto-posting  
6. (Optional) Edit the AI prompt to match your personal voice or niche  

### Requirements

- Google Drive & Sheets access

### How to customize

- Change the prompt for the AI to fit your voice or audience
