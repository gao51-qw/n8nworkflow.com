It automates the full flow from email to report delivery.\n\nWhen a new diagnosis email arrives:\n\nThe email content is captured and parsed by an AI agent (Gemini or any customizable LLM).\n\nPatient and medical data is extracted into structured fields (e.g., name, phone, diagnosis).\n\nData is logged into a Google Sheet for records.\n\nA Google Docs medical report is generated using a predefined template.\n\nThe report is exported as PDF and emailed to stakeholders (e.g., managers or sales team).\n\nThis template supports custom AI models, customizable Google Docs templates, and flexible filtering based on sender email.\n\n## 🛠️ Features\nGmail email trigger (customizable sender filter)\n\nAI-powered diagnosis parsing using Gemini (easily switchable to OpenAI or others)\n\nGoogle Sheets log\n\nGoogle Docs templated report (auto-filled)\n\nPDF export and email sending\n\nFull flexibility & customization\n\n## 🔧 Requirements\nBefore using this template, you'll need:\n\nA connected Gmail account (to receive diagnosis emails)\n\nA valid Google Sheets integration (create your own sheet with the desired columns)\n\nA Google Docs template document that includes placeholder tags like {{patient_name}}, {{date}}, etc.\n\nA Gemini or OpenAI API connection for the AI agent (fully customizable)\n\nNote: You must replace all Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets references with your own documents.
