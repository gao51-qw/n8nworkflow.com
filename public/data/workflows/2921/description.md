- **Campaign Name** (`utm_campaign`)
- **Source** (`utm_source`)
- **Medium** (`utm_medium`)
- **Term** (Optional: `utm_term`)

Adjust as needed based on your tracking requirements. For guidance on setting up your Airtable base and using the API, refer to the [Airtable Web API Documentation](https://www.airtable.com/developers/web/api).

### **3. Convert UTM Links to QR Codes**

Use a **QR code generator API** (e.g., `goqr.me`, `qrserver.com`) to generate QR codes for each UTM link and store them in Airtable.

### **4. Schedule Google Analytics Performance Reports (Every 7 Days)**
