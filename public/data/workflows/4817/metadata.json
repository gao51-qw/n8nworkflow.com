  "description": "### This n8n template demonstrates how to use AI to compose or \"stitch\" separate images together to generate a new image which retains the source assets and consistent style.\n\nUse cases are many: Try producing storyboard scenes with consistent characters, marketing material with existing product assets or trying on different articles on fashion!\n\n**Good to know**\n* At time of writing, each image generated will cost $0.039 USD. See Gemini Pricing for updated info.\n* The model used in this workflow is geo-restricted! If it says model not found, it may not be available in your country or region.\n\n### How it works\n* We'll import our required assets via our Cloud storage using the HTTP node.\n* The images are then converted to base64 strings and aggregated so we can use it for our AI model.\n* Gemini's image generation model is used which takes all 3 images and a prompt that we define. Our prompt instructs the model on how to compose the final image.\n* Gemini generates a new image but uses the original 3 assets to do so. The consistency to the source images is very high and shows little signs of hallucinations!\n* Gemini's output is base64 so we use a \"Convert to file\" node to convert the data to binary.\n* The final binary image is then uploaded to Google Drive to complete the demonstration.\n\n### How to use\n* The manual trigger node is used as an example but feel free to replace this with other triggers such as webhook or even a form.\n* Technically, you should be able to compose even more images but of course, the generation will take longer and cost more.\n\n### Requirements\n* Gemini account for LLM and Image generation\n* Google drive for upload\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* AI Image editing can be used for many use-cases. Try a popular use-case such as virtual try-on for fashion or applying branding on editing image assets.",
