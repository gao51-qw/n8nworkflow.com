    "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow creates a sophisticated, self-improving customer support system that automatically handles incoming emails. It's designed to answer common questions using an AI-powered knowledge base and, crucially, to learn from human experts when new or complex questions arise, continuously expanding its capabilities.\n\nThink of it like having an AI assistant with a smart memory and a human mentor. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1.  **New Email Received:** The workflow is triggered whenever a new email arrives in your designated support inbox (via Gmail).\n2.  **Classify Request:** An AI model (`Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite`) first classifies the incoming email to ensure it's a genuine support request, filtering out irrelevant messages.\n3.  **Retrieve Knowledge Base:** The workflow fetches all existing Question and Answer pairs from your dedicated Google Sheet knowledge base.\n4.  **AI Answer Attempt:** A powerful AI model (`Google Gemini 2.5 Pro`) analyzes the customer's email against the entire knowledge base. It attempts to find a highly relevant answer and drafts a complete HTML email response if successful.\n5.  **Decision Point:** An `IF` node checks if the AI found a confident answer.\n    *   **If Answer Found:** The AI-generated HTML response is immediately sent back to the customer via Gmail.\n    *   **If No Answer Found (Human-in-the-Loop):**\n        *   **Escalate to Human:** The customer's summarized question and original email are forwarded to a human expert (you or your team) via Gmail, requesting their assistance.\n        *   **Human Reply & AI Learning:** The workflow waits for the human expert's reply. Once received, another AI model (`Google Gemini 2.5 Flash`) processes both the original customer question and the expert's reply to distill them into a new, generic, and reusable Question/Answer pair.\n        *   **Update Knowledge Base:** This newly created Q&A pair is then automatically added as a new row to your Google Sheet knowledge base, ensuring the system can answer similar questions automatically in the future.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~10-15 minutes**\n\nThis workflow requires connecting your Gmail and Google Sheets accounts, and obtaining a Google AI API key. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n1.  **Connect Your Gmail Account:**\n    *   Select the `On New Email Received` node.\n    *   Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`** to connect your Gmail account. Grant the necessary permissions.\n    *   Repeat this for the `Send AI Answer` and `Ask Human for Help` nodes, selecting the credential you just created.\n\n2.  **Connect Your Google Sheets Account:**\n    *   Select the `Get Knowledge Base` node.\n    *   Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`** to connect your Google account. Grant the necessary permissions.\n    *   Repeat this for the `Add to Knowledge Base` node, selecting the credential you just created.\n\n3.  **Set up Your Google Sheet Knowledge Base:**\n    *   **Create a new Google Sheet** in your Google Drive.\n    *   Rename the first sheet (tab) to `QA Database`.\n    *   In the first row of `QA Database`, add two column headers: `Question` (in cell A1) and `Answer` (in cell B1).\n    *   Go back to the `Get Knowledge Base` node in n8n. In the **Document ID** field, select your newly created Google Sheet. Do the same for the `Add to Knowledge Base` node.\n\n4.  **Get Your Google AI API Key (for Gemini Models):**\n    *   Visit Google AI Studio at [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).\n    *   Click **\"Create API key in new project\"** and copy the key.\n    *   In the workflow, go to the `Google Gemini 2.5 Pro` node, click the **Credential** dropdown, and select **`+ Create New Credential`**.\n    *   Paste your key into the **API Key** field and **Save**.\n    *   Repeat this for the `Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite` and `Google Gemini 2.5 Flash` nodes, selecting the credential you just created.\n\n5.  **Configure Human Expert Email:**\n    *   Select the `Ask Human for Help` node.\n    *   In the **Send To** field, replace the placeholder email address with the actual email address of your human expert (e.g., your own email or a team support email).\n\n6.  **Activate the Workflow:**\n    *   Once all credentials and configurations are set, activate the workflow using the toggle switch at the top right of your n8n canvas.\n\n**Start Learning!**\nSend a test email to the Gmail account connected to the `On New Email Received` node. Observe how the AI responds, or how it escalates to your expert email and then learns from the reply. Check your Google Sheet to see new Q&A pairs being added!",

This new entry must be suitable for an automated system to use for future, similar inquiries.\n</goal>\n\n<context>\nThis task is part of a 'human-in-the-loop' automated customer support workflow. When the system cannot answer a customer's email using its existing knowledge base (a Google Sheet), the question is forwarded to a human expert. You are now receiving the original question and the expert's reply.\n\nYour generated Q&A pair will be added as a new row to the Google Sheet knowledge base. This will allow the system to answer this question automatically next time.\n\nKey principles to follow:\n1.  **Generalize the Question:** Rephrase the customer's question to be generic and universally applicable. Remove any personal information (names, specific order numbers, account details, etc.) and formulate it as a general query that other customers might ask.\n2.  **Refine the Answer:** Clean up the expert's reply. It should be a complete, well-formatted, and polite response that is ready to be sent directly to a customer without further editing. Remove conversational filler like \"Hi John,\" or \"Hope this helps!\".\n3.  **Capture the Essence:** The final Q&A pair should accurately represent the core problem and its solution.\n</context>\n\n<examples>\n<example_1>\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\nHi, my name is Jane Doe and I ordered a blue widget last Tuesday (order #12345). I haven't received a shipping confirmation yet. Can you tell me how long shipping usually takes to California? Thanks, Jane\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\nHey Jane, I checked your order. It's currently being processed. For future reference, our standard shipping to the US West Coast is typically 5-7 business days. Cheers.\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n  \"question\": \"What are the standard shipping times to the US West Coast?\",\n  \"answer\": \"Standard shipping to the US West Coast typically takes 5-7 business days after your order has been processed. You will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number as soon as your order is dispatched.\"\n}\n</output>\n</example_1>\n\n<example_2>\n<inputs>\n<customer_question>\nI can't find where to reset my API key on my dashboard. I looked in the settings but it's not there. Help!\n</customer_question>\n<expert_answer>\nNo problem. To do that, you need to go to the 'Developer' section, not 'Settings'. From there, you'll see a 'Revoke Key' button. Click that and a new one will be generated for you.\n</expert_answer>\n</inputs>\n<output>\n{\n  \"question\": \"How do I reset my API key?\",\n  \"answer\": \"You can reset your API key by following these steps:\\n1. Log in to your account and navigate to the 'Developer' section in your dashboard.\\n2. Click on the 'Revoke Key' button.\\n3.
