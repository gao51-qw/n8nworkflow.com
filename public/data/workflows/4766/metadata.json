  "description": "**How it works**\n\nThis workflow automates your entire LinkedIn content strategy, from ideation to publishing.\n\n* **Daily Idea Generation:** Every day, the workflow uses an advanced AI agent (Anthropic's Claude model) to generate a new, viral-optimized LinkedIn post idea, complete with a title, full text, and a detailed image description. It analyzes your past posts from a Google Sheet to ensure content is fresh and aligns with one of your four content pillars: timeless principles, case studies, growth hacks, or controversial ads.\n* **AI Image Creation:** It then uses OpenAI's DALL-E to create a custom, high-quality image based on the generated description and a style reference image you provide, ensuring brand consistency.\n* **Review & Approval Workflow:** The generated post and its accompanying image are automatically saved as a new row in a Google Sheet, marked with a \"review\" status. This gives you full editorial control.\n* **Automated Publishing:** Once you approve a post by changing its status to \"ready\" in the Google Sheet, a separate part of the workflow picks it up and automatically publishes it to your LinkedIn profile at a scheduled time.\n* **Status Tracking:** After publishing, the workflow updates the status in your Google Sheet to \"posted,\" so you always have a clear overview of your content pipeline.\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nThis workflow integrates several services. Follow these steps to get it running:\n\n1.  **Copy the Google Sheet:** Make a copy of the [AI Posts Content Machine Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-F3ZioIs3oWOKMyDPMuquaH-qiuaZs6qdZXP-yNeRbs/edit?usp=sharing) and select your copy in the `Get Past Ideas`, `Save Post`, `Get Ready Posts`, and `Update Status` nodes.\n2.  **Set Up Credentials:** You will need to create and add API credentials for the following services within the corresponding n8n nodes:\n    * **Google Sheets & Google Drive:** Create a Google credential.\n    * **Anthropic:** Add your API key in the `Anthropic Chat Model` node.\n    * **OpenAI:** Add your API key as a Header Auth credential in the `OpenAI Image` node.\n    * **Perplexity AI:** Add your API key as a Header Auth credential inside the `Perplexity Research` sub-workflow.\n    * **LinkedIn:** Create a LinkedIn credential.\n3.  **Customize Your Content:**\n    * In the `Idea Generator` node, adjust the system prompt to reflect your specific audience, topics, and content style.\n    * Create a folder in Google Drive for your post images. Add a reference image to this folder that defines your desired visual style.\n    * Paste the shareable link to your style reference image into the `Image Style` node.\n4.  **Activate the Workflow:** Enable the workflow to start the automated content creation and publishing process.",
