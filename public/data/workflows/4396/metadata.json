  "description": "# 🤖 AI Cart Recovery Agent: Smart Abandoned Checkout Assistant\n\nTransform abandoned carts into recovered sales with intelligent automation. This sophisticated n8n workflow monitors checkout abandonment, implements smart waiting periods, and sends AI-generated personalized recovery emails only when needed - maximizing conversions while respecting customer experience.\n\n## 🔄 How It Works\n\nThis intelligent 7-step recovery system recovers lost sales automatically:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Abandonment Detection**\nThe workflow fetches current abandoned checkout data from your e-commerce platform (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.), identifying customers who added items but didn't complete their purchase.\n\n**Step 2: Strategic Grace Period**\nInstead of immediately sending recovery emails, the system waits 1 hour (customizable), giving customers natural time to complete their purchase without pressure or interruption.\n\n**Step 3: Smart Re-verification**\nAfter the waiting period, the workflow rechecks the abandonment status by fetching updated checkout data, ensuring accuracy before taking action.\n\n**Step 4: Intelligent Decision Logic**\nAdvanced conditional logic compares initial and updated abandonment lists, determining if customers are still abandoned or have completed their purchase during the grace period.\n\n**Step 5: AI-Powered Email Generation**\nFor customers still showing abandonment, GPT generates personalized recovery emails featuring:\n- Customer's actual name for personal connection\n- Specific products left in their cart\n- Friendly, non-pushy messaging tone\n- Optional discount incentives\n- Compelling call-to-action to complete purchase\n\n**Step 6: Automated Email Delivery**\nPersonalized recovery emails are sent directly to abandoned customers via Gmail or your preferred email service, maintaining professional branding and deliverability.\n\n**Step 7: Comprehensive Activity Logging**\nAll recovery attempts are logged in Google Sheets for tracking, including customer details, email content, and campaign performance analytics.\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Steps\n\n### Prerequisites\n- E-commerce platform with API access (Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce)\n- OpenAI API key for personalized email generation\n- Gmail or SMTP email service for delivery\n- Google Sheets for activity tracking and analytics\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n\n### E-commerce Platform Configuration\n\n**Shopify Setup:**\n```\nAPI Endpoint: https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2023-10/checkouts.json\nAuthentication: X-Shopify-Access-Token header\nRequired Permissions: Read checkouts, Read customers\nParameters: status=abandoned\n```\n\n**WooCommerce Setup:**\n```\nAPI Endpoint: https://your-site.com/wp-json/wc/v3/orders\nAuthentication: Consumer Key/Secret or JWT\nParameters: status=pending, status=failed\nRequired Plugins: WooCommerce REST API\n```\n\n### Configuration Steps\n\n**1.
