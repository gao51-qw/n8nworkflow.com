## Who It’s For
This template is ideal for:
- **Researchers**: Transcribe and summarize interviews, lectures, or research recordings.
- **Content Creators**: Convert podcasts or videos into transcripts and social captions/show notes.
- **Students**: Automatically turn lectures or study group audio into summarized notes.
- **Professionals**: Log meeting notes and summaries directly into your Notion workspace.

## How It Works
This four-step workflow performs the following:

- **Step 1:** **Trigger: New Audio in Google Drive**
Automatically triggers when a new audio file (MP3/WAV) is uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder.The file is then downloaded for processing.

- **Step 2: Transcribe Audio with Whisper**
The audio file is sent to OpenAI’s Whisper model for high-accuracy transcription.

- **Step 3: Summarize Transcript with GPT-4**
The transcript is passed to GPT-4, which generates a clean, concise summary.

- **Step 4: Store Summary in Notion**
A new Notion page is created with the generated summary and optional metadata (file name, upload time, etc.).

## Setup Instructions
- **Step 1: Google Drive Trigger**
Connect your Google Drive account.
Select the folder you want to monitor.
This node detects new file uploads and passes the file for download.

- **Step 2: Download File**
Downloads the new audio file for transcription.
Step 3: Transcribe Recording (OpenAI Whisper)
Connect your OpenAI API Key.
Ensure this node receives the binary audio file.
It will return the transcription as plain text.

- **Step 3: Transcribe Recording (OpenAI Whisper)**
Connect your OpenAI API Key.
Ensure this node receives the binary audio file.
It will return the transcription as plain text.

- **Step 4: Summarize Transcript (GPT-4 via AI Agent)**
Use your OpenAI API Key.
Configure a summarization prompt like:
"Summarize the following transcript in a clear and concise manner:"
Connect the output from Whisper into this GPT-4 prompt.

- **Step 5: Notion Integration**
Connect your Notion account.
Choose or create a database to store summaries.
Map the GPT output (summary) to a "Text" or "Rich Text" property.
Optionally include metadata like filename, file upload date, etc.
