### Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **logistics operations** that cannot rely on a **Transportation Management System** to **record proofs of deliveries**.

### What is a delivery confirmation?
This workflow uses a **Telegram bot** to automatically notify **logistics teams** by email when a **shipment is delivered**.

Drivers (equipped with their smartphones) can **record their arrival** with all the necessary information for accurate distribution planning.

### How do we notify the delivery?
Let us imagine a truck driver arriving at the destination; he can contact the bot to be guided on how to record the delivery.

0. **User Guide**: the first bot's message is a brief explanation of the process 
1. **Record Shipment Number**: the bot asks the driver to share the shipment number and record it
2. **Collect GPS Location**: the bot asks the driver to share its GPS location and record them
3. **Picture of the Shipment**: the bot asks for a picture of the shipment and saves it in Google Drive
4. **Send Confirmation**: after data collection, the bot proposes to send a confirmation to the logistics management team

An email is then automatically sent by the N8N workflow including all the information recorded by the flow and a picture of the shipment.
