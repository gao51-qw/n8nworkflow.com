# How it works

This workflow automatically monitors supplier health and supply chain risks, providing real-time alerts and daily reports to procurement teams.

## Key Steps

1. **Daily Risk Check** - Runs the workflow every morning at 9:00 AM to assess supplier health.
2. **Multi-Source Data Collection** - Scrapes supplier websites, investor relations pages, and industry news for risk indicators.
3. **AI-Powered Risk Analysis** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract and analyze financial status, operational issues, and regulatory problems.
4. **Risk Scoring Engine** - Calculates comprehensive risk scores (1-10) based on multiple factors including financial health, operational disruptions, and news sentiment.
5. **Alternative Supplier Discovery** - Automatically searches for backup suppliers when high-risk situations are detected.
6. **Smart Alert System** - Routes notifications based on risk levels: immediate alerts for high-risk suppliers, daily summaries for normal operations.
7. **Multi-Channel Notifications** - Sends alerts via Slack and detailed reports via email to procurement teams.
