Create tables in PostgreSQL\n- Open the SQL script provided in the workflow.\n- Replace `n8n` with your actual database schema name.\n- Run the script to set up the required tables.\n\n#### 2. Add required credentials\n- **WhatsApp**: Set up OAuth and connect your WhatsApp account.\n- **PostgreSQL**: Add your Postgres DB credentials to n8n.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Update the test questions and answers directly in the database.\n- Modify the bot flow to suit your test structure or messaging preferences.\n- Extend the ranking logic based on specific grading criteria or scoring rules.",
