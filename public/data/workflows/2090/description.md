This workflow allows you to ask questions about data stored in a database using AI.

To use it, you'll need an OpenAI API key (although you could also swap in a model from another service).

Supported databases:
- Postgres
- MySQL
- SQLite

The workflow uses n8n's embedded chat, but you could also modify it to work with a chat service such as Slack, MS Teams or WhatsApp.

Note that to use this template, you need to be on n8n version 1.19.4 or later.
