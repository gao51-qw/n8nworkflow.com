## 📸 What this workflow does
Automatically captures a screenshot of a tech news homepage, extracts headlines into structured JSON, logs them in Google Sheets, and posts a daily trend report (7–10 bullet points) to Telegram at 07:00.

Details:
- ApiFlash takes a cropped full-page screenshot of technewsworld.com (configurable).
- Gemini Vision analyzes the image and returns one strict JSON object (captured_at, source, sentiment, items[]).
- Code node cleans and parses JSON (removes code fences).
- Google Sheets stores each headline (headline, topic, highlight, sentiment).
- Last 3 days of entries (max 30) are aggregated.
- Gemini writes a concise Trend Report.
- Telegram sends both the screenshot and the summary.
