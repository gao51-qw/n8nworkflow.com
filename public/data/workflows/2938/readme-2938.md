# Googleform submission to create a Github issue bug report

> # Automated Workflow for Google Form Submissions, GitHub Issues, and Discord Notifications

This workflow streamlines how new Google Form submissions are processed by automatically creating GitHub issues and sending real-time notifications to a Discord channel through a webhook.

---

## Who Is This Template For?
- **Developers** looking to centralize bug reporting and issue tracking.  
- **Project Managers** seeking an efficient way to log tasks and updates.  
- **QA Teams** that need a fast, automated process for reporting and resolving issues.  

---

## Workflow Overview

1. **Google Form Trigger**  
   - The workflow begins with a **Google Sheets Trigger** node that checks for new form submissions every minute.

2. **Add New Form Submissions to Google Sheets**  
   - Each new submission is recorded in a dedicated Google Sheet for easy reference and archiving.

3. **Filter Out Already Posted Issues**  
   - An **If** node checks if the issue is already posted on GitHub by looking for an existing GitHub link in the sheet.

4. **Format Message / Output Parsing**  
   - If the issue is new, an **OpenAI Chat Model** node generates a structured output, including a title, description, and suggested fix.

5. **Add Issue to GitHub**  
   - The structured output is used to create a new issue in the specified GitHub repository.

6. **Send Notification to Discord**  
   - A Discord webhook is triggered to send a notification to your chosen channel, including a link to the newly created GitHub issue.

7. **Add GitHub Link to the Sheet**  
   - The GitHub issue link is added back to the Google Sheet for easy cross-referencing.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Google Sheets Setup
- **Create/Designate a Google Sheet:** Ensure it’s set to receive form submissions.  
- **Configure the Trigger Node:** Provide the correct document ID and sheet name in the Google Sheets Trigger node.

### 2. OpenAI Configuration
- **API Credentials:** Set up the OpenAI Chat Model node with valid OpenAI API credentials.  
- **Prompt Definition:** Create a prompt that formats the form submission data into a structured output (e.g., title, description, suggested fix).

### 3. GitHub Configuration
- **OAuth Credentials:** Configure the GitHub node with your GitHub OAuth credentials.  
- **Target Repository:** Specify the repository where new issues should be created.

### 4. Discord Webhook
- **Webhook URL:** Obtain a webhook URL from your Discord server.  
- **Notification Setup:** Use the HTTP Request node to send notifications to your chosen Discord channel.

### 5. Google Sheets Update
- **Document & Sheet Name:** Provide the same Google Sheet details used in the first step.  
- **Add GitHub Link:** Update the corresponding row with the newly created GitHub issue link.

## Recommended Google Sheet Columns
- **Timestamp**: Automatically recorded when the form is submitted.  
- **Issue Title**: Generated by the OpenAI Chat Model.  
- **Issue Description**: Detailed breakdown of the issue.  
- **GitHub Link**: Automatically populated once the issue is created.  
- **Discord Notification Status** (optional): Indicates whether the notification was sent successfully.

## Additional Notes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: The conditional logic ensures existing issues aren’t recreated on GitHub.  
- **AI-Powered Formatting**: OpenAI helps structure the issue details, providing clarity for developers.  
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Discord notifications keep your entire team updated on new issues as they arise.
