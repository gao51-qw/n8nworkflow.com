    "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is for professionals and teams who want to automate LinkedIn message replies with intelligent, human-like responses — without losing control over tone or accuracy. Ideal for founders, sales teams, DevRel, or community managers handling high-volume inbound messages.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nResponding to every LinkedIn message manually is slow and inconsistent. Basic AI bots generate replies without context or nuance. This subworkflow solves both problems by using structured message routing from Notion and profile insights from UniPile to craft smart, context-aware responses.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow takes the sender’s message and profile (from [LinkedIn Auto Message Router with Request Detection](#)) and references your centralized [Notion database of message types](https://www.notion.so/1da5b6e0c94f808680b6eab8e340d60e). It uses that to either match the message to a known response or generate a new one using OpenAI's GPT model — all while following professional tone guidelines.\n\nThis is the **third workflow in a 3-part automation system**:\n\n- Receives data from **[LinkedIn Auto Message Router with Request Detection](#)**\n- Uses **[UniPile LinkedIn Profile Lookup Subworkflow](#)** to enrich responses based on follower count or org data\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nIf a message comes from someone with low reach (e.g., under 1,000 followers), the AI politely deflects a meeting request. If an influencer reaches out, the AI immediately offers a booking link. Your team controls this logic by updating the Notion database — no edits to the workflow required.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Connect this workflow as a subworkflow in your router or Slack approval flow\n2. Store your Notion API key and database ID in n8n\n3. Provide the following parent inputs:\n   - `message` – The LinkedIn message text\n   - `sender` – Name of the sender\n   - `chatid` – Session ID (optional for memory)\n   - `linkedinprofile` – Enriched array with LinkedIn context (follower count, connection info, etc.)\n\n4. Add your preferred AI model credentials (supports OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama)\n5. Optional: Customize system prompt to better match your brand voice\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Update the Notion schema to include industry-specific categories or actions\n- Change the AI tone (e.g., humorous, more corporate, etc.)\n- Add conditional logic for auto-sending messages without Slack approval\n- Extend to support multiple platforms (e.g., email, X/Twitter, Instagram DMs)\n\n",

If a match is found, use the **corresponding response** as a base — you may slightly tailor it if needed (e.g., change names or dates).\n- If no close match is found, generate a **new, thoughtful reply** based on the message content, tone guidelines, and best practices in business networking. If you do not have a direct link or URL to provide from the Request Database, do not reference a website or URL. Instead say a variation of let me get back to you on that and see what I can find. \n\n### Tone Guidelines:\n- Friendly, confident, and professional — but never robotic.\n- Lightly personalized. Use the sender’s name if available.\n- Avoid sounding like a sales pitch.\n- Keep replies concise and natural, like something you'd actually send on LinkedIn.\n\n### When generating a new message:\n- Acknowledge the sender’s message.\n- Add a relevant, helpful comment or question to continue the conversation.\n- Keep the tone warm and open-ended.\n\n### Output format:\nOnly output the message text that should be sent to the user. Do not explain your reasoning. If you do not have a direct link to provide, do not reference a website or URL. Instead say let me get back to you on that and see what I can find. \n\nLet’s begin.\nRequest Database:\n\n{{ $json.dbObject.join('\\n\\n----\\n\\n') }}\n\nWhen responding, use the following format:\n{\n\t\"output\": \"message response\",\n\t\"found\": true\n}\nFor output output the message response, for found output a boolean, true if an example is found in the Request Database, false if a response is not found.
