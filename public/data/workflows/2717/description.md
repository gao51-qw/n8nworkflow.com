# AI Chatbot with Conditional Execution for Cost Efficiency  

## Description  

This **n8n workflow** implements an **AI-powered chatbot** that **only runs when a chat is initiated on a website**. By introducing a conditional step, the workflow ensures that **AI tokens are not consumed unnecessarily**, making it a cost-efficient and resource-optimized solution.  

The chatbot, named **Sophia**, serves as an **interactive assistant for SyncBricks**. It helps users with **guest posting services, YouTube review videos, IT consultancy, and online courses** while collecting user details step by step. The chatbot ensures that inquiries are properly logged and confirmed before proceeding to AI-driven responses.  

This template is ideal for **businesses, service providers, and content creators** who want to **optimize AI token usage** while delivering **personalized, interactive engagement** with their users.  

## Features  

1. **Conditional Execution** – The AI chatbot **only activates when a chat is initiated**, avoiding unnecessary API calls.  
2. **AI-Powered Conversations** – Uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate human-like responses.  
3. **Step-by-Step Data Collection** – Ensures **structured user input**, requesting **name, email, and request type** sequentially.  
4. **Memory Buffer for Context Awareness** – Maintains conversation context using a **window buffer memory** system.  
5. **Multiple Service Offerings** – Supports inquiries related to:  
   - **Guest Posting Services**  
   - **YouTube Review Videos**  
   - **Online Courses on Udemy**  
   - **IT Consultancy Services**  
6. **Automated Confirmation Messages** – After collecting user details, sends a **confirmation message** summarizing the request.  

## How It Works  

1. **Chat Message Trigger**  
   - The workflow starts **only when a chat message is received** from the website.  
   - This ensures **no AI token is consumed unless a user initiates a chat**.  

2. **Condition Check: Is Chat Input Provided?**  
   - The workflow checks if **chat input is non-empty**.  
   - If the chat input is empty, **the workflow stops**, ensuring **no unnecessary API usage**.  
   - If a message is detected, **the chatbot continues** processing.  

3. **AI-Powered Chat Response**  
   - The chatbot, **Sophia**, generates **personalized responses** using **Google Gemini AI**.  
   - AI ensures **structured conversation flow** by collecting:  
     - **User’s Full Name**  
     - **Email ID**  
     - **Request Type**  

4. **Memory Buffer for Context Retention**  
   - A **Window Buffer Memory** system **stores chat history** and **retrieves previous responses** to ensure **context-aware conversations**.  

5. **Response Optimization**  
   - **Checks memory** to avoid **asking the same question twice**.  
   - If details are already provided, **Sophia moves directly to processing the request**.  

6. **Confirmation & User Engagement**  
   - After collecting the required details, Sophia **summarizes the request** as follows:  
     - *"Got it [Name], your request is [Request Type]. I will be sending the details to your email ID: [Email]. Hold on while I send confirmation."*  

7. **Final Confirmation Message**  
   - Ensures the **user receives a proper acknowledgment** of their inquiry.
