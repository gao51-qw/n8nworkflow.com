Automatically turn your Google Calendar into a fully-automated notification system with email alerts, SMS reminders, and a live performance dashboard - all powered by n8n.

This automation helps you never miss an event, while giving you clear visibility into what notifications were sent, when, and how reliably they ran.

**What This Automation Does**

This solution is built as 4 connected workflows that run on a schedule and work together:

**1. Daily Email Summary (Morning)**

Every morning, the workflow:

- Reads today’s events from Google Calendar

- Formats them into a clean email

- Sends a daily schedule summary via Mailchimp or SendGrid

**2. Daily SMS Summary**

Shortly after, it:

Sends a concise SMS overview of today’s meetings using Twilio

**3. 15-Minute Event Reminders**

Before each event:

- Sends an individual SMS reminder

- Skips all-day events automatically

**4. Weekly Schedule Preview**

Every Sunday:

- Sends a week-ahead summary so you can plan in advance

**Live Reporting & Dashboard**

All workflow activity is logged automatically into Google Sheets, which powers a real-time analytics dashboard showing:

- Number of notifications sent

- Success vs failure rates

- Daily and weekly execution stats

- Visual charts powered by Chart.js

- No manual tracking needed, everything updates automatically.

**How the Workflow Is Structured**

The automation is grouped into 3 clear sections:

**Section 1: Calendar Data Collection**

- Pulls events from Google Calendar

- Filters relevant meetings

- Prepares clean event data

**Section 2: Notifications & Messaging**

- Formats emails and SMS messages

- Sends reminders and summaries

- Handles scheduling logic

**Section 3: Logging & Reporting**

- Saves every execution to Google Sheets

- Updates daily stats automatically

- Feeds the live dashboard
