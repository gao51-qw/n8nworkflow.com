  "description": "## Delete a Dialogflow Intent via Telegram 🗑️\n\nThis workflow allows you to delete a specific Dialogflow intent simply by sending the keyword `delete` through Telegram. It’s designed for quick and safe deletions from your mobile device, without needing to access the Dialogflow console.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What does this workflow do?\n\n1. **Listens for Telegram messages** using the `Telegram Trigger` node.\n2. **Validates the user ID** through the `User validation by ID` node, ensuring only authorized users can trigger the deletion.\n3. **Checks if the message equals `delete`** using the `Keyword validation` node.\n4. If both checks pass:\n   - Performs an HTTP GET request via `HTTP Request GET NAME` to **retrieve the name of the intent** (used in the confirmation message).\n   - Adds a small delay using `simulated delay`.\n   - Then executes a DELETE request to the Dialogflow API via the `HTTP Request ELIMINAR` node to **delete the intent**.\n   - Sends a Telegram confirmation message through the `Confirmation message` node.\n5. If the user ID or keyword is invalid:\n   - Responds with a custom message using either `Invalid user message` or `Invalid keyword message`.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Requirements\n\n- A valid **Google API credential** (Service Account) set up in n8n.\n- Obtain your `PROJECT_ID` and `INTENT_ID` from the URL of the intent in Dialogflow:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Use Cases\n\n- Delete test or unused intents **without opening Dialogflow**.\n- Automate cleanup of outdated intents.\n- Allow controlled Telegram-based access for specific users to delete intents remotely.",
