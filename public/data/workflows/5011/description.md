This template shows how to use the Question and Answer tool to save costs in RAG use cases.

## Who is this for?
This template is for everyone who wants to start giving knowledge to their Agents through RAG.

## Requirements
Have a PDF with custom knowledge that you want to provide to your agent.

## Setup
No setup required. Just hit `Execute Workflow`, upload your knowledge document and then start chatting.

## How to customize this to your needs
1. Add custom instructions to your Agent by changing the prompts in it.
2. Add a different way to load in knowledge to your vector store, e.g. by looking at some Google Drive files or loading knowledge from a table.
3. Describe your data properly in the Q&A tool
4. Exchange the `Simple Vector Store` nodes with your own vector store tools ready for production.
5. Add a more sophisticated way to rank files found in the vector store.
