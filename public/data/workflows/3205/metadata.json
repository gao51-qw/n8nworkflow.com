  "description": "[![changelog](https://xqus.relezy.com/haveibeenpwnedcom-breaches/badge.svg)](https://xqus.relezy.com/haveibeenpwnedcom-breaches)\n\n## Who is this for?\n- Security professionals\n- Developers\n- Individuals interested in data breach awareness\n\n## Use Case\n- Automated monitoring for new breaches\n- Proactive identity protection\n- Demonstration of simple cache mechanism\n\n## What this workflow does\n- Checks the Have I Been Pwned API every 15 minutes for the latest breaches.\n- Compares new breach data against previously notified breaches.\n- Demonstrates a simple cache mechanism to track previously seen breaches.\n\n## How the Cache Functionality Works\n- **Read from Cache**: Retrieves the last known breach from `cache.json` to avoid redundant alerts for the same breach.\n- **Compare Against Current Breach**: The workflow checks if the latest fetched breach differs from the cached one.\n- **Update the Cache**: If a new breach is detected, it updates `cache.json` with the latest breach data.\n\n## Setup instructions\n1. The endpoint used in this workflow does *not* require an API key.\n2. Add your desired alert mechanism in the red box attached to the `New breach` node.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Modify Notification Settings**: Tailor where alerts are sent (email, Slack, etc.). Add the desired node after the `New breach` node. This node contains all the data from the breach so it is eaisily available.\nYou can choose from a variety of n8n nodes to send alerts when a new breach is detected. Below are a few common options you might consider adding after the New breach node:\n\n1. **Email Node**\nWhat it does: Sends an email notification to one or more recipients.\nUse case: Great for simple alerts to your inbox or a team distribution list.\nCustomization: You can include breach details in the subject or body of the email, using data from the New breach node.\n2. **Slack Node**\nWhat it does: Sends a message to a Slack channel or user.\nUse case: Perfect for real-time alerts to your team in Slack.\nCustomization: You can post breach details directly in a channel or DM. You can also format the message (bold, code blocks, etc.).\n3. **Microsoft Teams Node**\nWhat it does: Sends a message to a Teams channel.\nUse case: For organizations that use Microsoft Teams for communication.\nCustomization: Similar to Slack, you can customize the message content and include all relevant breach information.\n4. **Discord Node**\nWhat it does: Sends an alert message to a Discord channel.\nUse case: Useful for teams or communities that coordinate via Discord.\nCustomization: Add formatted messages with breach details for easy viewing.\n5. **Telegram Node**\nWhat it does: Sends messages to a Telegram chat or group.\nUse case: Good for mobile notifications and fast alerts.\nCustomization: You can include breach summaries or detailed information, and even use bots to automate this.\n6. **Webhook Node** (as a sender)\nWhat it does: Sends breach data to another service via a webhook.\nUse case: If you have an external system or app that handles alerts, you can push the data directly to it.\nCustomization: Send JSON payloads with detailed breach information to trigger actions in other systems.\n7. **SMS Nodes** (like Twilio)\nWhat it does: Sends an SMS notification to one or more phone numbers.\nUse case: For urgent alerts that need to be seen immediately.\nCustomization: Keep messages concise, including key breach details like the time, type of breach, and affected system.\n- **Adjust Check Frequency**: Change the interval in the Schedule Trigger node (e.g., hourly or daily).",
