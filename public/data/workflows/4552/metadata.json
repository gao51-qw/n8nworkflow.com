  "description": "🧠 Google Drive Upload Trigger → Pinecone Vector Upsert for Document Indexing\nCategory: AI & LLM / Document Indexing\nLevel: Intermediate\nTags: Google Drive, Pinecone, OpenAI, Embeddings, Vector Store, LangChain, RAG\n\n📄 What This Workflow Does\nThis workflow watches a specific Google Drive folder and automatically uploads any newly added document to a Pinecone vector database — complete with OpenAI-generated embeddings.\n\nPerfect for setting up retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, semantic search, or document Q&A systems. Once configured, your knowledge base stays up-to-date with zero manual effort.\n\nWatch Full Step By Stey Tutorial Video Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Automatewithmarc\n\n🔧 How It Works\n📁 Google Drive Trigger\nWatches a specific folder and triggers when new documents are uploaded.\n\n🔍 Google Drive File Search & Download\nFinds and fetches all files in the folder.\n\n🔄 Loop Over Each File\nHandles batch processing for multiple files.\n\n📃 Document Loader\nParses each file as binary and applies custom metadata like document type.\n\n✂️ Text Splitter\nBreaks content into manageable chunks for embedding (e.g., 600 characters, 60 overlap).\n\n🧠 OpenAI Embeddings\nGenerates vector embeddings using OpenAI.\n\n📦 Pinecone Vector Store\nInserts/upserts documents into a specific Pinecone namespace for search-ready indexing.\n\n🧠 Why This is Useful\nThis is a production-grade setup for:\n\nBuilding vector search tools over internal docs\n\nFeeding up-to-date data into RAG agents or chatbots\n\nAuto-tagging and chunking files for scalable AI workflows\n\nWhether you’re indexing course outlines, SOPs, or technical docs — this automation keeps your vector store fresh and organized.\n\n🪜 Setup Instructions\nConnect your Google Drive, OpenAI, and Pinecone accounts.\n\nSpecify the Google Drive folder to monitor.\n\nCustomize metadata, chunk size, or vector namespace as needed.\n\nActivate the workflow and drop a file into the folder — magic happens behind the scenes.\n\n📌 Notes\nWorks best with PDFs or text-based documents.\n\nYou can swap out OpenAI with other embedding models if needed.\n\nConsider adding notifications or logging (e.g., via Slack or email) for better observability.",
