  "description": "\n\n# Create FAQ articles from Slack threads to Notion and Zendesk\n\nThis workflow helps you capture \"tribal knowledge\" shared in Slack conversations and automatically converts it into structured documentation. By simply adding a specific reaction (default: 📚) to a message, the workflow aggregates the thread, uses AI to summarize it into a Q&A format, and publishes it to your knowledge base (Notion and Zendesk).\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Customer Support Teams** who want to turn internal troubleshooting discussions into public help articles.\n- **Knowledge Managers** looking to reduce the friction of documentation.\n- **Development Teams** wanting to archive technical decisions made in Slack threads.\n\n## What it does\n1.  **Trigger:** Watches for a specific emoji reaction (📚 `:book:`) on a Slack message.\n2.  **Data Collection:** Fetches the parent message and all replies in the thread to get the full context.\n3.  **AI Processing:** Uses **OpenAI** to analyze the conversation, summarize the solution, and format it into a clear Question & Answer structure.\n4.  **Publishing:**\n    - Creates a new page in a **Notion** database with tags and summaries.\n    - (Optional) Drafts a new article in **Zendesk**.\n5.  **Notification:** Replies to the original Slack thread with links to the newly created documentation.\n\n## Requirements\n- **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n- **Slack** workspace (with an App installed that has permissions to read channels and reactions).\n- **OpenAI** API Key.\n- **Notion** account with an Integration Token.\n- **Zendesk** account (optional, can be removed if not needed).\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Configure Credentials:** Set up authentication for Slack, OpenAI, Notion, and Zendesk in n8n.\n2.  **Setup Notion:** Create a database in Notion with the following properties:\n    - `Name` (Title)\n    - `Summary` (Text/Rich Text)\n    - `Tags` (Multi-select)\n    - `Source` (URL)\n    - `Channel` (Select or Text)\n3.  **Update Configuration Node:** Open the **Workflow Configuration1** node (Set node) and replace the placeholder values:\n    - `slackWorkspaceId`: Your Slack Workspace ID (e.g., T01234567).\n    - `notionDatabaseId`: The ID of your Notion database.\n    - `zendeskSectionId`: (Optional) The ID of the section where articles should be created.\n4.  **Slack App Scopes:** Ensure your Slack App has the following scopes: `reactions:read`, `channels:history`, `groups:history`, `chat:write`.\n\n## How to customize\n- **Change the Trigger:** If you prefer a different emoji (e.g., 📝 or 💡), update the \"Right Value\" in the **IF - :book: Reaction Check** node.\n- **Modify the Prompt:** Edit the **OpenAI** node to change how the AI formats the answer (e.g., ask it to be more technical or more casual).\n- **Remove Zendesk:** If you don't use Zendesk, simply delete the **Zendesk** node and remove the reference to it in the final **Slack - Notify Completion** node.\n\n",
