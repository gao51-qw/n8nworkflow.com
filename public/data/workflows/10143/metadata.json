  "description": "# Demo Personalized Email\n\nThis n8n workflow is built for AI and automation agencies to **promote their workflows through an interactive demo** that prospects can try themselves.  \nThe featured system is a **deep personalized email demo**.\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 How It Works\n\n1. **Prospect Interaction**\n   - A prospect starts the demo via Telegram.  \n   - The Telegram bot (created with BotFather) connects directly to your n8n instance.\n\n2. **Demo Guidance**\n   - The **RAG agent** and **instructor** guide the user step-by-step through the demo.  \n   - Instructions and responses are dynamically generated based on user input.\n\n3. **Workflow Execution**\n   - When the user triggers an action (e.g., testing the email demo), n8n runs the workflow.  \n   - The workflow collects website data using **Crawl4AI** or standard HTTP requests.\n\n4. **Email Demo**\n   - The system personalizes and sends a demo email through **SparkPost**, showing the automation’s capability.  \n\n5. **Logging and Control**\n   - Each user interaction is logged in your database using their `name` and `id`.  \n   - The workflow checks limits to prevent misuse or spam.  \n\n6. **Error Handling**\n   - If a low-CPU scraping method fails, the workflow automatically escalates to a higher-CPU method.  \n\n## ⚙️ Requirements\n\nBefore setting up, make sure you have the following:\n\n- [**n8n**](https://n8n.io/) — Automation platform to run the workflow  \n- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) — Required to run Crawl4AI  \n- [**Crawl4AI**](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) — For intelligent website crawling  \n- [**Telegram Account**](https://t.me/BotFather) — To create your Telegram bot via BotFather  \n- [**SparkPost Account**](https://www.sparkpost.com/) — To send personalized demo emails  \n- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) — To store log data such as user name and ID  \n\n\n## 🚀 Features\n\n- **Telegram interface** using the BotFather API  \n- **Instructor and RAG agent** to guide prospects through the demo  \n- **Flow generation limits per user ID** to prevent abuse  \n- **Low-cost yet powerful web scraping**, escalating from low- to high-CPU flows if earlier ones fail  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Development Ideas\n\n- Replace the RAG logic with your own query-answering and guidance method  \n- Remove the flow limit if you’re confident the demo can’t be misused  \n- Swap the personalized email demo with any other workflow you want to showcase  \n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Technical Notes\n\n- **Telegram bot** created with BotFather  \n- **Website crawl process:**\n  - Extract sub-links via `/sitemap.xml`, `sitemap_index.xml`, or standard HTTP requests  \n  - Fall back to **Crawl4AI** if normal requests fail  \n  - Fetch sub-link content via HTTPS or Crawl4AI as backup  \n- **SparkPost** used for sending demo emails  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Create a Telegram Bot\n- Use **BotFather** on Telegram to create your bot and get the **API token**.  \n- This token will be used to connect your n8n workflow to Telegram.  \n\n### 2. Create a Log Data Table\n- In your database, create a table to store user logs.  \n- The table must include at least the following columns:\n  - `name` — to store the user’s name or Telegram username.  \n  - `id` — to store the user’s unique identifier.  \n\n### 3. Install Crawl4AI with Docker\n- Follow the installation guide from the official repository:  \n  👉 [https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)  \n- **Crawl4AI** will handle website crawling and content extraction in your workflow.  \n\n---\n## 📦 Notes\n\nThis setup is optimized for **low cost**, **easy scalability**, and **real-time interaction** with prospects.  \nYou can customize each component — **Telegram bot behavior**, **RAG logic**, **scraping strategy**, and **email workflow** — to fit your agency’s demo needs.\n\n\n👉 You can try the live demo here: [**@email_demo_bot**](https://t.me/email_demo_bot)\n\n---\n\n",
