# WooCommerce Product Reviews: Sentiment Analysis with Slack Summary

This workflow automatically fetches product reviews from your WooCommerce store, analyzes the sentiment of each review using AI, stores the results in Airtable and sends a summary of positive, neutral and negative reviews to Slack. It helps teams quickly understand overall customer feedback, track product sentiment and stay updated without manually reading all reviews.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1.  Import the workflow JSON file into n8n.
2.  Configure credentials:
    *   WooCommerce HTTP Basic Auth (for fetching reviews)
    *   OpenAI API (for sentiment analysis)
    *   Airtable Personal Access Token (for storing reviews)
    *   Slack API (for sending summary messages)
3.  Adjust the Cron/Schedule Trigger node to your preferred interval (e.g., every 10 minutes).
4.  Test the workflow with a few reviews to ensure AI and Slack integrations work correctly.
5.  Activate the workflow after confirming functionality.
    

## What It Does

This workflow automates sentiment analysis and team notification:

*   **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at defined intervals.
*   **Set WooCommerce Domain** – Defines the WooCommerce store to fetch reviews from.
*   **Fetch Reviews** – Retrieves all recent product reviews using WooCommerce API credentials.
*   **Loop Over Items** – Processes reviews in smaller batches for efficiency.
*   **Message a Model** – Sends each review to OpenAI to detect sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and generate a short summary.
*   **Merge & Code Nodes** – Combines original review data with AI results and ensures proper data alignment.
*   **If Node** – Checks sentiment for further processing.
*   **Create a Record (Airtable)** – Stores each review and its sentiment in Airtable.
*   **Code Summary Node** – Counts positive, neutral, and negative reviews to create a summary.
*   **Send a Message (Slack)** – Posts the sentiment summary to the team’s Slack channel for visibility.
