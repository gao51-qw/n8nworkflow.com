  "description": "This Template gives the ability to monitor all uplinks for your Meraki Dashboard and then alert your team in a method you prefer. This example is a Teams notification to our Dispatch Channel\n\n![image.png](fileId:777)\n\nSetup will probably take around 30 minutes to 1h provided with the Template. Most time intensive steps are getting a Meraki API key which I go over and setting up the Teams node which n8n has good documentation for.\n\nTutorial & explanation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvaN0dNwRNU",
