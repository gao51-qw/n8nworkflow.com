The document also includes a column for the resulting virtual try-on image URL, which is initially empty.\n\n3. **Setting Up the Request**:\n   - The **Set data** node prepares the data for the AI request by assigning the model image URL and the product image URL to variables.\n\n4. **AI Image Generation**:\n   - The **Create Image** node sends a request to API to generate a virtual try-on image. The request includes the URLs of the model and the clothing product.\nWhen you register for the API service you will get 1$ for free. For continuous work add API credits to your account.\n\n5. **Image Retrieval**:\n   - The **Get Url image** node retrieves the URL of the generated virtual try-on image.\n   - The **Get File image** node downloads the generated image from the provided URL.\n\n6. **Image Storage**:\n   - The **Upload Image** node uploads the generated image to a specified Google Drive folder for storage.\n\n7. **Updating Google Sheets**:\n   - The **Update result** node updates the Google Sheets document with the URL of the generated virtual try-on image.\n\n8. **Updating WooCommerce**:\n   - The **Update product** node updates the corresponding product in WooCommerce by adding the generated virtual try-on image to the product's image gallery.\n\n---\n\n### **Functionality**\nThis AI Agent is designed to streamline the process of creating realistic images of clothing products worn by models, eliminating the need for expensive photoshoots.
