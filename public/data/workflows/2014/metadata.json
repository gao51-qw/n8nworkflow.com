The workflow initiates with a manual trigger (On clicking ‘execute’).\n    2. It reads your Google sheet file.\n    3. It connects to your Icypeas account.\n    4. It performs an HTTP request to search for the email addresses.\n\n**Set up steps**\n    1. You will need a formated Google Sheet file with firstnames,lastnames and company/domain names. \n    2.
