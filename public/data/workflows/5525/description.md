This fun workflow automates the generation and delivery of personalized jokes by email based on the names or objects entered in the form. The process works as follows:

## On form submission
The workflow starts when someone submits a form with the required names or objects to create the joke.
You can modify the form fields to make the jokes more creative.

## Set the output language
Manually define the language in which you want to receive the joke.

## OpenAI Message Model
Uses the OpenAI model to generate the joke based on the prompt and in the chosen language.
(The response is limited to around 200 tokens.)

## Gmail: send message
The generated joke is automatically sent to the specified email address via Gmail.
