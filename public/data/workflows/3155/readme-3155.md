# Automatic weekly digital PR stories suggestions with Reddit and Anthropic

> ## Introduction
The "Automatic Weekly Digital PR Stories Suggestions" workflow is a sophisticated automated system designed to identify trending news stories on Reddit, analyze public sentiment through comment analysis, extract key information from source articles, and generate strategic angles for potential digital PR campaigns. 

This workflow leverages the power of social media trends, natural language processing, and AI-driven analysis to deliver curated, sentiment-analyzed news opportunities for PR professionals.

Operating on a weekly schedule, the workflow searches Reddit for posts related to specified topics, filters them based on engagement metrics, and performs a deep analysis of both the content and public reaction. 

It then generates comprehensive reports that include story opportunities, audience insights, and strategic recommendations. These reports are automatically compiled, stored in Google Drive, and shared with team members via Mattermost for immediate collaboration.

This workflow solves the time-consuming process of manually monitoring social media for trending stories, analyzing public sentiment, and identifying PR opportunities. 

By automating these tasks, PR professionals can focus on strategy development and execution rather than spending hours on research and analysis.

## Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for digital PR professionals, content marketers, communications teams, and media relations specialists who need to stay on top of trending stories and public sentiment to develop timely and effective PR campaigns. It's particularly valuable for:

- PR agencies managing multiple clients across different industries
- In-house PR teams needing to identify media opportunities quickly
- Content marketers looking for trending topics to create timely content
- Communications professionals monitoring public perception of industry news

Users should have basic familiarity with n8n workflows and the PR strategy development process. While technical knowledge of the integrated APIs is not required to use the workflow, some understanding of Reddit, sentiment analysis, and PR campaign development would be beneficial for interpreting and acting on the generated reports.

## What problem is this workflow solving?
Digital PR professionals face several challenges that this workflow addresses:

1. **Information Overload**: Manually monitoring social media platforms for trending stories is time-consuming and often results in missed opportunities.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Complexity**: Understanding public perception of news stories requires reading through hundreds of comments and identifying patterns, which is labor-intensive and subjective.

3. **Content Extraction**: Visiting multiple news sources to read and analyze articles takes significant time.

4. **Strategic Angle Development**: Identifying unique PR angles that leverage trending stories and public sentiment requires synthesizing large amounts of information.

5. **Team Collaboration**: Sharing findings and insights with team members in a structured format can be cumbersome.

By automating these processes, the workflow enables PR professionals to quickly identify trending stories with PR potential, understand public sentiment, and develop strategic angles based on comprehensive analysis, all while maintaining a structured approach to team collaboration.
