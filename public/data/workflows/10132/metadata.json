  "description": "# Description\nAutomate the discovery and analysis of PDF files across a deeply nested OneDrive folder structure. This workflow recursively searches folders, filters for new or updated PDFs, extracts text, and uses a Mistral AI agent to generate a concise Executive Summary, Key Findings, and Structured Metadata (Date, Location, etc.), storing all insights into a n8n Data Table for easy access and further automation.\n\n# Key Features & How It Works\n#### Scheduled Trigger & Recursive Folder Search:\n\n- The workflow runs automatically (scheduled for 8 PM in this template) to monitor a specified main folder on OneDrive.\n\n- It performs a deep, multi-level search (up to 8 layers) across subfolders to ensure no documents are missed.\n\n#### Smart Deduplication & Filtering:\n\n- It checks new files against an internal n8n Data Table using the Compare Datasets node, ensuring only new or unique PDF files are processed, saving AI credits and processing time.\n\n- A size check is also included, preventing attempts to process excessively large files.\n\n- AI-Powered Document Intelligence (Mistral LLM):\n\n#### For each new PDF, the workflow extracts the text and passes it to a Mistral AI model for dual-stream analysis:\n\n- Overview Agent: Generates an impartial, professional Executive Summary, a list of Key Findings & Data Points, and the document's Scope/Context.\n\n- Document Information Agent: Extracts crucial metadata, including the single most relevant date, location (City/State/Country), and professional information (Name, Title, Organization).\n\n#### Structured Output and Archiving:\n\n- AI outputs are meticulously validated and reformatted into a clean JSON object using Structured Output Parsers.\n\n- The complete analysis, along with the original file name and path, is then logged as a new row in an n8n Data Table.\n\n# Setup Notes\nOneDrive Folder: You must specify the exact name of your main folder in the 'Search for Main Folder' node.\n\nData Table: Ensure your n8n Data Table exists with the required columns: Summary, Key_Findings, Scope, Date, Location, File_Name, and Path.\n\nDeep Folder Structure: The current configuration supports up to 8 levels of subfolders. If your files go deeper, you may need to add more \"Get items in a folder\" and \"If\" nodes.\n\nAI Customization: Review the AI agent prompts and the structured output schemas to customize the fields you want to extract or the summary style you require.\n\n# Extend This Workflow\n#### The final output is organized data. You can easily extend this workflow to:\n\n- Send daily/weekly digest emails with new summaries.\n\n- Sync the extracted data to a Google Sheet, Airtable, or other database.\n\n- Add a secondary AI agent to perform follow-up actions based on the \"Key Findings.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
