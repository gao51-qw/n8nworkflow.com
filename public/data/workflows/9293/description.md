## How it works

This workflow automatically analyzes meeting effectiveness and provides constructive feedback:

• **Retrieve meeting minutes**: Automatically searches and retrieves meeting minutes from Google Drive using either a Google Docs URL or meeting name

• **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Comprehensively evaluates meeting effectiveness score, speaking time distribution, communication quality (clarity, friendliness, decisiveness, listening), disagreements, and more

• **Generate actionable feedback**: Outputs a structured report in Japanese with specific improvement suggestions and highlights of what went well

## Set up steps

Setup takes approximately **5 minutes**:

• **Connect Google Drive**: Grant permission for the workflow to access your meeting minutes by connecting to Google Drive

• **First run**: Enter the meeting minutes URL or meeting name and execute the workflow

For detailed setup instructions and step-by-step explanations, please refer to the sticky notes inside your workflow.
