  "description": "### How It Works: The AI Recruiter Engine\n\nThis workflow is a powerful, two-phase system designed to automate the entire passive candidate sourcing and engagement cycle.\n\n---\n\n#### **Phase 1: Sourcing & Enrichment**\nThis phase is triggered manually and focuses on finding, analyzing, and scoring potential candidates.\n1.  **Manual Trigger:** You start the workflow manually by providing a `jobTitle` and `keywords`.\n2.  **Code (Generate Search Query):** This node uses your input to create a sophisticated search query for an external sourcing platform.\n3.  **HTTP Request (Hunter.io/Clearbit):** The workflow queries a third-party API to find public email addresses for the target companies or candidates.\n4.  **Code (Filter Candidates):** This node filters the raw data, keeping only candidates who match your basic criteria.\n5.  **Airtable/Google Sheets (Log Candidates):** All potential candidates are logged into your centralized database to serve as your simple ATS.\n6.  **Code (AI Analysis & Score):** This node prepares a prompt with the candidate's profile data and sends it to a generative AI model (via an `HTTP Request`). It then calculates a final score based on the AI's analysis and other criteria.\n7.  **If (Is Score &gt; 75?):** This node checks if the candidate’s score meets your threshold. If so, they are passed to the next phase; otherwise, they are filtered out.\n\n#### **Phase 2: Automated Outreach & Nurturing**\nThis phase handles the multi-step, personalized email communication with high-scoring candidates.\n1.  **Gmail (Send Initial Email):** The workflow sends a personalized first email using dynamic data from the candidate's profile.\n2.  **Airtable/Google Sheets (Update Status):** The candidate's status is updated to `Contacted` in your database.\n3.  **Wait:** The workflow pauses for a set period (e.g., 3 days) to allow time for a response.\n4.  **If (No Reply?):** This node checks the candidate's status in your database. If they haven't replied, the workflow proceeds to the next email.\n5.  **Gmail (Send Follow-up):** A follow-up email is sent to the candidate. This sequence repeats with a final nurture email to close the loop.\n\n---\n\n### How to Set Up\n\n1.  **Prepare Your Credentials & Database:**\n    * **Database:** Create a database in **Airtable** or **Google Sheets** with columns for `Name`, `Email`, `Score`, `Status`, and any other data you want to track.\n    * **Email:** Set up a **Gmail** or other email service credential in n8n.\n    * **Sourcing API:** Obtain an API key for a sourcing service like Hunter.io to find public email addresses.\n\n2.  **Import the Workflow:**\n    * Import the JSON code for the **AI Recruiter Engine** into your n8n instance.\n\n3.  **Configure the Nodes:**\n    * **Manual Trigger:** When running the workflow, manually input the `jobTitle` and `keywords` you are sourcing for.\n    * **HTTP Request:** Update the `URL` with your sourcing API key.\n    * **Code Nodes:** Review and adjust the JavaScript in the `Code` nodes to match your specific job criteria and data structure.\n    * **Airtable/Google Sheets:** Connect to your database, select the correct table, and ensure the column names in the node settings match your database.\n    * **Gmail:** Select your email credential and customize the content of the outreach emails in each `Gmail` node.\n    * **If:** Adjust the `finalScore` threshold in the `If` node to your desired value.\n\n4.  **Test and Activate:**\n    * Run the workflow once manually to ensure all nodes are configured correctly and data flows as expected.\n    * Once you are confident, the workflow is ready to be run for your sourcing campaigns.",
