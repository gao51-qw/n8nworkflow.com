  "description": "# Define Your ICP from Customer LinkedIn Profiles\n## Use Case\nThis automation helps marketing and sales teams define their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) using real LinkedIn profiles of current high-fit customers. By enriching and analyzing profile data, it generates a clear ICP definition and scoring methodology for future targeting.\n\n## What This Automation Does\nThis automation analyzes LinkedIn profiles of your existing customers and produces:\n- A structured ICP definition\n- A scoring model to evaluate future prospects\n- A Google Boolean search string to find similar prospects\n\nInput:\n- LinkedIn profile URLs of existing high-fit customers (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirashkenazi/`)\n\nOutput:\n- A Google Doc containing the ICP analysis and scoring methodology\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Trigger**: Waits for a chat message containing one or more LinkedIn profile URLs.\n2. **AI Agent**: Parses and processes the URLs.\n3. **Airtop Data Enrichment**: Uses Airtop to extract structured information from each LinkedIn profile (e.g., job title, company, experience, skills).\n4. **Memory**: Maintains state between inputs for consistent analysis.\n5. **LLM Analysis**: Uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet to synthesize enriched data into a meaningful ICP.\n6. **Google Docs**: Automatically creates a new doc with a timestamped title and appends the ICP definition.\n\n## Setup Requirements\n1. [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to LinkedIn, Insert the profile name in the Airtop Tool\n2. Airtop API credentials. [Get it free here](https://www.airtop.ai/)\n3. If you choose to activate saving the profiles in Google Docs you will need OAuth2 credentials (or just copy the ICP definition from the chat)\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Use the ICP for Scoring**: Feed new LinkedIn profiles through the same Airtop enrichment and use the scoring function to evaluate fit.\n- **Automate Target Discovery**: Plug the Boolean search output into LinkedIn, Google, or People Data Labs for ICP-matching lead generation.\n- **Refine Continuously**: Repeat the workflow as your customer base grows or segments evolve.\n\nRead more about how to [Define ICP from Customer Examples](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/define-icp-from-customer-examples-n8n)",
