  "title": "Generate custom AI images with OpenAI GPT-Image-1 model",
  "description": "**How it works**  \n1. Trigger the workflow manually via the n8n UI.  \n2. Define key parameters like the image prompt, number of images, size, quality, and model.  \n3. Send a POST request to OpenAI’s image generation API using those inputs.  \n4. Split the API response to handle multiple images.  \n5. Convert the base64 image data into downloadable binary files.\n\n**Set up steps**  \nInitial setup takes around 5–10 minutes. You’ll need an OpenAI API key, a configured HTTP Request node with credentials, and to customize the prompt/parameter fields in the “Set Variables” node. No advanced config or external services needed.\n\n**Important Note**\nYou have to make sure to complete OpenAI's new verification requirements to use their new image API:\nhttps://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification\n\nIt only takes a few minutes and does not cost any money.",
