## HOW IT WORKS :
Automates SaaS operations by consolidating user management, AI-driven support triage, analytics, and billing into one unified system. User signups flow through registration, support requests route via OpenAI prioritization, billing events trigger confirmations, and daily analytics feed dashboards. The AI Business Logic layer orchestrates real-time decisions, enriches data, and triggers Gmail notifications. Four data streams converge into centralized routing for customer onboarding, ticket triage, metrics aggregation, and revenue automation.
 
## SETUP STEPS:
1. Add OpenAI API credentials for chat model routing
2. Authenticate Gmail with app password for notifications
3. Connect Data Table Tool for user/support/billing storage
4. Configure workflow settings: priority thresholds and routing rules
5. Test each branch with sample data to verify all integrations

## PREREQUISITES:
OpenAI API key, Gmail account with app password, MCP Server access, Data Table Tool credentials
