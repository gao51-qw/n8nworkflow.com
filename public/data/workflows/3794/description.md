# Automate Solar Lead Qualification & Follow-ups with Google Sheets and Gmail

Note: This template is designed for both self-hosted and cloud-based n8n instances. The workflow image above shows the complete automation flow.

This n8n workflow automates the entire solar lead qualification process - from capturing lead information through a webhook, storing data in Google Sheets, evaluating qualification criteria, and sending personalized email follow-ups based on qualification status.

## Who is this for?

This workflow is designed for:

* Solar installation companies
* Solar sales teams
* Renewable energy consultants
* Lead generation specialists in the solar industry

## What problem does this workflow solve?

Managing solar leads efficiently can be challenging. This workflow solves several key pain points:

* Time-consuming manual lead qualification: Automatically evaluates leads against predefined criteria
* Inconsistent follow-up: Ensures every lead receives a timely, personalized response
* Document management: Securely stores and shares utility bill documents
* Lead tracking inefficiency: Centralizes lead data in Google Sheets with qualification status

## What this workflow does

This workflow creates a complete solar lead management system that:

1. Captures lead information through a webhook endpoint
2. Securely stores utility bill uploads in Google Drive
3. Records all lead data in Google Sheets
4. Automatically evaluates leads based on three qualification criteria:
   * Homeownership status
   * Credit score (must be 650+)
   * Absence of trees on roof
5. Updates qualification status in the Google Sheet
6. Sends personalized email follow-ups based on qualification status:
   * Qualified leads receive a congratulatory email with next steps
   * Disqualified leads receive helpful information about why they didn't qualify and suggestions for remediation

## How to customize this workflow to your needs

### Adjusting Qualification Criteria

You can modify the qualification logic in the "[STEP 7] Check Qualification Criteria" node:

1. Open the node and click the "Edit Code" button
2. Locate the criteria sections (homeowner, credit score, trees on roof)
3. Modify the conditions as needed:

```javascript
// Example: Change credit score threshold
if (creditScoreRaw.includes("600 - 649") ||
    creditScoreRaw.includes("650 - 689") ||
    creditScoreRaw.includes("690 - 719") ||
    creditScoreRaw.includes("720+")) {
    creditQualified = true;
}
```

4. Add additional criteria if needed

### Customizing Email Templates

Personalize your emails further:

1. Open the email nodes
2. Use variable references to include more customer data:

```
Dear {{ $json.Name }},

We noticed your utility bill shows an average of {{ $json.monthlyBill }} per month.
With solar, you could save approximately {{ $json.monthlySavings }}.
```

### Adding Integration with CRM Systems

Extend this workflow by connecting it to your CRM:

1. Add a Hubspot/Salesforce/etc. node after the "[STEP 8] Update Qualification Status" node
2. Configure the node to create or update contacts in your CRM
3. Map the lead data fields to your CRM fields

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Webhook not receiving data
   * Verify your form is correctly configured to send POST requests
   * Check CORS settings on your website
   * Ensure all required fields are being sent

2. Google Drive upload failing
   * Check Google Drive permissions
   * Verify your OAuth scopes include drive.file
   * Ensure your Drive has sufficient storage space

3. Email not sending
   * Verify Gmail credentials
   * Check if Gmail API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
   * Look for Send Rate Exceeded errors in execution logs

### Google Sheets Column Format

If you're having issues with data not appearing correctly:

1. Make sure the column names exactly match those in the code
2. Check that the Google Sheet permissions allow editing
3. Verify the sheet name is correctly referenced in the nodes
