## 📈 Automated Customer Rewards Platform: Jotform Integration

This blueprint details a highly efficient, AI-powered workflow designed to automate customer reward fulfillment. Leveraging the accessible interface of Jotform, this system delivers superior reliability and exceptional processing speed.

## 📊 Reliability, Productivity, and Performance
This workflow is engineered to maximize operational efficiency and maintain data integrity:

* Instant Fulfillment: Automation handles receipt scanning (OCR), AI calculation, logging, and notification in seconds, eliminating manual delays.
* Seamless Data Capture: Leverages the **user-friendly Jotform** interface for fast, reliable customer submission and file uploads. 
## 🛠️ Quick Configuration Guide
* **Jotform Webhook:** In your **JotForm** settings, paste the n8n **Jotform Trigger URL** into the Webhook Integration. Done.
* **API Access:** Generate a **"Full Access"** JotForm API key and insert it into the required n8n nodes (Jotform Trigger and Fetch All Receipts).
* **Credential Setup:** Plug in your necessary API keys (Gemini, OCR.Space) and update the Notion Database ID and internal email recipient.
## 🚀 How It Works (Practical Flow)
* **1. Submission:** Customer submits their request via **Jotform**.
* **2. Processing:** System extracts text from the receipt (OCR), the AI calculates the reward, and the If node verifies the total.
* **3. Fulfillment:** Transaction logged, confirmation emails sent to both the customer and the internal team.
