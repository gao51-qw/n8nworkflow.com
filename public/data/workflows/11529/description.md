**Overview**

This workflow automatically reads school-related emails from Gmail, uses AI to understand what each email is about, and then organizes everything into Google Drive and Google Calendar. It classifies messages into schedules, “what to bring” lists, general notices, and contact information, creates calendar events when needed, saves text files in Drive, and sends you a daily reminder email about tomorrow’s important events.

**Who this is for**

Parents or caregivers who get lots of school emails and want everything organized automatically

Busy families who often forget dates, deadlines, or 持ち物 (things to bring)

Anyone who wants school communication stored in a structured, searchable way in Drive and Calendar

**How it works**

Trigger: Gmail watch for new emails
A Gmail Trigger node watches your inbox and starts the workflow whenever a new email arrives. It then loads the full message content (subject, body, metadata).

AI classification and extraction
The email text is sent to an AI model, which returns a structured JSON object with:

category: “Schedule”, “What to Bring”, “Notice”, or “Contacts”

eventTitle, eventDescription, eventDate (ISO format)

itemsToBring, contacts, subject, id, and hasAttachments
This turns messy school emails into clean structured data.

Routing by category
A Switch node routes each email based on its category and whether it has attachments:

Schedule / What to Bring → create a calendar event and also save a notice file

Notice → save a notice file only

Any email with attachments → send to the attachment branch for optional photo storage

Save notices to Google Drive
For all categorized emails, the workflow creates a text file in Google Drive containing:

Title, date, category, items to bring, and a short description of the event or notice.

Create calendar events
For “Schedule” and “What to Bring” emails, the workflow builds a summary and description (including 持ち物) and creates a Google Calendar event. If no end time is given, it defaults to one hour after the start.

Save photo attachments (optional)
If the email has image attachments, the workflow:

Downloads the attachments from Gmail

Filters to only image files

Saves the photos in a specified Google Drive folder, using the original file name

Extract and archive contact information
The workflow also pulls out the sender’s contact info (From), links it to the email subject and timestamp, and saves it as a separate contact text file in Google Drive for easy reference.

Daily reminder for tomorrow’s events
Every morning at a set time, a Schedule Trigger runs:

It fetches all events from Google Calendar for “tomorrow”

Filters down to events whose description includes “持ち物”

Sends you an email summarizing tomorrow’s events and what you need to bring, so you can prepare in advance.

**How to set up**

Connect your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive credentials in the respective nodes.

In the Workflow Configuration node, set:

photosFolderId – Drive folder for saved photos

noticesFolderId – Drive folder for notice text files

contactsFolderId – Drive folder for contact text files

reminderEmail – email address that will receive the daily reminder

Make sure the Gmail Trigger is pointing to the correct mailbox and is set to poll as often as you like.

Confirm that the Google Calendar node uses the calendar where you want school events to appear.

Turn the workflow on and test it with a few real school emails (schedules, what to bring, general notices).

**Customization ideas**

Adjust the AI prompt in Extract Email Info to better match your school’s typical email style or to add more categories.

Change the logic for calendar events (all-day events, different default times, or additional fields like location).

Modify file naming patterns or folder structure in Google Drive (e.g., separate folders per child, per school year, or per class).

Add logging to Google Sheets for a timeline view of all school communication.

Forward or mirror important events/notices to other tools such as Slack, Notion, or a family LINE group.
