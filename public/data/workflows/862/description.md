Do you want to control the DNS domain entries of your customers or servers?

This workflow gets DNS information of any domain using the uProc [**Get Domain DNS records tool**](https://app.uproc.io/#/tools/processor/get/domain/records).

You can use this workflow to check existing DNS records in real-time to ensure that any domain setup is correct.

You need to add your credentials (Email and API Key - real -) located at [**Integration section**](https://app.uproc.io/#/settings/integration) to n8n.

You can replace "Create Domain Item" with any integration containing a domain, like Google Sheets, MySQL, or Zabbix server.

Every "uProc" node returns multiple items with the next fields per every item:
- type: Contains the DNS record type (A, ALIAS, AAAA, CERT, CNAME, MX, NAPTR, NS, PTR, SOA, SRV, TXT, URL).
- values: Contains the DNS record values.
