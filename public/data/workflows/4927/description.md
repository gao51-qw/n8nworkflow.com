# Why
Teachers now spend 3-4 hours per lesson creating materials and resources from scratch. With additional/special needs, this makes it difficult to create additional materials. This is unsustainable and takes their time away from teaching. Tailored for UK teachers but can be expanded globally with prompt and form enhancements.


## How it works
I built a system with three specialized AI agents that create complete lesson packages and automatically uploads a document in Google drive and puts an appointment in calendar to review the document.
### Features
1. Research agent to pull specific information including special education needs and curriculums.
2. The scoring and assessment agent to generate tailored assessment plans, assignments, grading mechanism based on chosen requirements.
3. The integration agent just provides ideas to expand to other tools. In nfuture there is opportunity to add on Kahoot or other tools to create quizzes.
4. Finally the enriched document is emailed and a calendar invite is sent for review.
