Configure n8n API Credential\n- Go to your n8n instance → Settings → API\n- Create a new API token with read access to workflows and executions\n- In this workflow, add a new \"n8n\" credential and paste your API token\n- This credential is used by two nodes: \"Get all Workflows\" and \"Get all previous executions\"\n\n### 2. Connect Email Services\n- Configure your Outlook credential in the \"Send a message outlook\" node\n- Configure your Gmail credential in the \"Send a message gmail\" node\n- Set your preferred email recipients in both nodes\n\n### 3. Adjust Schedule (Optional)\n- By default, the workflow runs every 7 days\n- Edit the \"Schedule Trigger\" node to change the interval if needed\n\n## Key features\n- Tracks workflow execution status and runtime metrics\n- Calculates average and total runtime for each status type\n- Provides visual HTML report with color-coded status indicators\n- Dual email delivery (Outlook + Gmail options)\n- Requires only n8n API credentials (no external API keys needed)\n- \n- ## Need Help\n🔗 [LinkedIn – Wessel Bulte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wessel-bulte/)",
