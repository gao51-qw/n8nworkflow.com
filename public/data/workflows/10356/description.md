## How It Works
A webhook or timer triggers the workflow to automatically fetch inventory data from multiple platforms. Stock levels are compared across stores to identify discrepancies, and any inconsistencies are updated on the respective platforms in real time. All changes and updates are recorded in Google Sheets for easy tracking, and email alerts are sent to notify relevant team members of any exceptions or issues that require attention. This ensures inventory accuracy and timely response to stock mismatches.

## Setup Steps
1. Add Shopify and/or WooCommerce API credentials to enable secure data access.
2. Connect Google Sheets for comprehensive logging of all inventory updates and Gmail for sending timely email alerts.
3. Configure the sync frequency within the Function nodes to control how often inventory data is fetched, compared, and updated.
