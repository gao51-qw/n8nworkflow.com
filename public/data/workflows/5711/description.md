Designed to work in tandem with the **Automated Stock Sentiment Analysis** workflow, this solution takes the top-performing stocks based on daily news sentiment and automatically rebalances your portfolio. It's perfect for algorithmic traders, data-driven investors, and n8n enthusiasts who want to see their AI analysis translate into tangible actions, all while maintaining a comprehensive log of every transaction in Google Sheets.

### How It Works

This workflow executes a sophisticated, automated trading strategy in a few key stages:

1.  **Daily Kick-off & Snapshot:** The workflow triggers on a daily schedule, first fetching your current Alpaca account balance and logging it to a Google Sheet to track daily performance.
2.  **Strategy Formulation:** It then reads the daily sentiment scores produced by the accompanying "Stock Sentiment Analysis" workflow. A Code node filters these results to identify the **top four stocks** with the highest positive sentiment.
3.  **The Decision Engine:** The core of the workflow is a custom Code node that acts as the trading brain. It:
    * Retrieves your currently open positions from Alpaca.
    * Compares your holdings against the day's top four sentiment stocks.
    * Generates a **"sell list"** of positions you hold that are no longer in the top four.
    * Generates a **"buy list"** of top-sentiment stocks that you don't yet own.
    * Calculates the total cash value from the "sell list" and determines the exact notional value to invest in each stock on the "buy list."
4.  **Trade Execution:**
    * The workflow first iterates through the "sell list" and executes a `DELETE` request to Alpaca for each, closing the positions.
    * A **Wait** node pauses the workflow for two minutes to ensure the sell orders are filled and the account balance is updated.
    * It then iterates through the "buy list," executing `POST` requests to Alpaca to purchase the new assets with the calculated funds.
5.  **Record Keeping:** All executed orders (both buys and sells) are merged and logged in a dedicated Google Sheet, giving you a permanent and detailed transaction history.
