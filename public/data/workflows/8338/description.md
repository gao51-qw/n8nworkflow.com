## About this Workflow  
This workflow helps you **repurpose your YouTube videos across multiple social media platforms** with zero manual effort. It’s designed for creators, businesses, and marketers who want to maximize reach without spending hours re-uploading content everywhere.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Trigger from YouTube**  
   - The workflow checks your YouTube channel every 10 minutes via RSS feed.  
   - It compares the latest video ID with the last saved one to detect if a new video was uploaded.  
   - Tutorial: [How to get YouTube Channel RSS Feed](https://chuck.is/yt-rss/#:~:text=Hit%20CTRL%2BF%20to%20pull,preferred%20RSS%20reader%20and%20rejoice.)  

2. **Generate Descriptions with AI**  
   - Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to automatically generate fresh, engaging descriptions for your posts.  

3. **Create Images with ContentDrips**  
   - ContentDrips offers multiple templates (carousel, single image, branding templates, etc.).  
   - The workflow generates a custom promotional image using your video description and thumbnail.  
   - Install node: `npm install n8n-nodes-contentdrips`  
   - Docs: [ContentDrips Blog Tutorial](https://contentdrips.com/blog/2025/07/automate-content-calendar-with-n8n-and-contentdrips-api/)  

4. **Publish Across Social Platforms with SocialBu**  
   - Instead of manually connecting each social media API, this workflow uses **SocialBu**.  
   - From a single connection, you can post to:  
     Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, and more.  
   - Website: [SocialBu](https://socialbu.com/)  

5. **Get Real-Time Notifications via Discord**  
   - After each run, the workflow sends updates to your **Discord** channel.  
   - You’ll know if the upload was successful, or if an error occurred (e.g., API limits).
