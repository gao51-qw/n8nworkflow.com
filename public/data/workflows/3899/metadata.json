  "title": "Automatically create Linear issues from Gmail support request messages",
  "description": "### This n8n template watches a Gmail inbox for support messages and creates an equivalent issue item in Linear.\n\n### How it works\n* A scheduled trigger fetches recent Gmail messages from the inbox which collects support requests.\n* These support requests are filtered to ensure they are only processed once and their HTML body is converted to markdown for easier parsing.\n* Each support request is then triaged via an AI Agent which adds appropriate labels, assesses priority and summarises a title and description of the original request.\n* Finally, the AI generated values are used to create an issue in Linear to be actioned.\n\n### How to use\n* Ensure the messages fetched are solely support requests otherwise you'll need to classify messages before processing them.\n* Specify the labels and priorities to use in the system prompt of the AI agent.\n\n### Requirements\n* Gmail for incoming support messages\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Linear for issue management\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Consider automating more steps after the issue is created such as attempting issue resolution or capacity planning.",
