### ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. **Trigger:** Receives new Typeform Webhook submissions via Webhook.  
2. **Data Extraction:** Parses name, email, and company info.  
3. **Email Verification:** Validates email deliverability with Hunter.io.  
4. **Company Enrichment:** Fetches company data (industry, size, country) using Abstract API.  
5. **Lead Scoring Logic:** Calculates a lead score and assigns a *tier* (Hot / Warm / Cold).  
6. **Conditional Routing:**  
   - **Hot Leads (≥70)** → Sent to HubSpot as *Qualified*.  
   - **Warm/Cold Leads (&lt;70)** → Sent to HubSpot as *Nurture* stage.  
7. **Revalidation Loop:**  
   - Waits (e.g., 3 days) → Rechecks Nurture leads in HubSpot.  
   - Logs them to Google Sheets and alerts your Slack channel.
