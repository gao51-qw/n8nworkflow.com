   - The AI ensures that each caption is tailored to the platform's audience, tone, and style, including hashtags and calls to action.

4. **Generate Images**:
   - The **Image Instagram** and **Image Facebook e Linkedin** nodes use **OpenAI** to generate platform-specific images for Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn posts.

     - **Publish on X**: Posts the caption on Twitter/X.
     - **Publish on LinkedIn**: Posts the caption and image on LinkedIn.
     - **Publish on Facebook**: Posts the caption and image on Facebook.
     - **Publish on Instagram**: Posts the caption and image on Instagram.

6. **Update Google Sheets**:
