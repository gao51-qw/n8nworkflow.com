The **Agent Decisioner** is a dynamic, AI-powered routing system that automatically selects the most appropriate large language model (LLM) to respond to a user's query based on the query’s content and purpose.

This workflow ensures **dynamic, optimized AI responses** by intelligently routing queries to the best-suited model.

### **Advantages**

* **🔁 Automatic Model Routing:**
  Automatically selects the best model for the job, improving efficiency and relevance of responses.

* **🎯 Optimized Use of Resources:**
  Avoids overuse of expensive models like GPT-4 by routing simpler queries to lightweight models.

* **📚 Model-Aware Reasoning:**
  Uses detailed metadata about model capabilities (e.g., reasoning, coding, web search) for intelligent selection.

* **📥 Modular and Extendable:**
  Easy to integrate with other tools or expand by adding more models or custom decision logic.

* **👨‍💻 Ideal for RAG and Multi-Agent Systems:**
  Can serve as the brain behind more complex agent frameworks or Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.

### **How It Works**  

1. **Chat Trigger**: The workflow starts when a user sends a message, triggering the **Routing Agent**.  
2. **Model Selection**: The **AI Agent** analyzes the query and selects the best-suited model from the available options (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet for coding, Perplexity/Sonar for web searches, GPT-4o Mini for reasoning).  
3. **Structured Output**: The agent returns a **JSON response** with the user’s prompt and the chosen model.  
4. **Execution**: The selected model processes the query and generates a response, ensuring optimal performance for the task.  

### **Set Up Steps**  

1. **Configure Nodes**:  
   - **Chat Trigger**: Set up the webhook to receive user messages.  
   - **Routing Agent (AI Agent)**: Define the system message with model strengths and JSON output rules.  
   - **OpenRouter Chat Model**: Connect to OpenRouter for model access.  
   - **Structured Output Parser**: Ensure it validates the JSON response format (`prompt` + `model`).  
   - **Execution Agent (AI Agent1)**: Configure it to forward the prompt to the selected model.  

2. **Connect Nodes**:  
   - Link the **Chat Trigger** to the **Routing Agent**.  
   - Connect the **OpenRouter Chat Model** and **Output Parser** to the **Routing Agent**.  
   - Route the parsed JSON to the **Execution Agent**, which uses the chosen model via **OpenRouter Chat Model1**.  

3. **Credentials**:  
   - Ensure **OpenRouter API credentials** are correctly set for both chat model nodes.  

4. **Test & Deploy**:  
   - Activate the workflow and test with sample queries to verify model selection logic.  
   - Adjust the routing rules if needed for better accuracy.
