## Automated AI Content Publisher
This n8n workflow is your all-in-one solution for automated content creation and publishing. It intelligently crafts unique articles in Thai, generates captivating AI images, and seamlessly publishes them to your website while notifying you via Telegram. Say goodbye to manual content pipelines and hello to effortless, AI-driven publishing.

How It Works
This workflow kicks off when new news data hits your designated Google Sheet, then it springs into action:

Smart Image Selection: An AI analyzes your news content to decide if a general photorealistic image or a more artistic, risoprint-style AI image is the best fit.

Article Generation: Another AI drafts a high-quality, long-form article in flawless Thai, adapting its format (listicle or analytical) to perfectly suit the topic.

SEO & Marketing Boost: A specialized AI then optimizes your content by generating concise titles, engaging excerpts, and relevant tags in both Thai and English. It also creates the perfect prompts for image generation.

AI Image Creation: Leveraging Google Gemini, the workflow generates stunning visuals, producing either photorealistic or artistic risoprint-style images based on the AI's prompts.

Seamless Publishing: Your newly created article, complete with its AI-generated image and all metadata, is automatically posted to your website.

Instant Notifications: You'll get a quick ping on Telegram with a summary of the new post, so you're always in the loop.
