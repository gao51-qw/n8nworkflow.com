## 📋 **Description**

Transform your booking chaos into streamlined automation with this production-ready GCalendar Smart Booking System. This comprehensive n8n workflow eliminates weeks of custom development by providing two powerful REST APIs that handle everything from input validation to calendar integration.

**What makes this special?** Unlike basic booking forms, this system includes enterprise-grade features like intelligent conflict detection, public holiday awareness, business hours enforcement, and automatic Google Calendar integration with Meet links. It's battle-tested with real-world business logic including lunch breaks, timezone handling, and comprehensive error responses.

### **Privacy & Cost Benefits:**
- **🔐 Privately yours & free** - No need to purchase expensive booking software or worry about data breaches. Your booking data stays secure in your own Google Calendar, completely under your control.
- **🎯 All-in-One solution** - No manual invitation sending required. Google Calendar automatically handles attendee notifications and generates real Google Meet links for every booking, creating a seamless experience for both you and your clients. No need pay for API to get public holiday, use the google calendar free default .

**Perfect for rapid deployment:** Whether you're building for clients, launching an MVP, or replacing expensive booking software, this template gets you from zero to production in under 15 minutes. The clean API design makes frontend integration effortless, while the robust validation ensures reliable operation at scale.

**Two endpoints, endless possibilities:**
- `/make-booking` - Complete booking creation with multi-layer validation
- `/check-booking-date` - Real-time slot availability listing (comes with conflict detection, business hour checks)

Built by developers, for developers - with comprehensive documentation, testing examples, and customization guides included.


### Purpose 
This workflow provides a webhook API endpoint that your frontend can easily integrate typically triggered by a submit button on a booking form.
When the frontend calls this REST API, the workflow handles the booking logic by performing several key checks:
- Valid Input — Ensures all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
- Date & Time Validation — Confirms the requested slot falls within business hours, excludes lunch/dinner breaks, and respects public holidays.
- Conflict Detection — Checks for any existing bookings at the requested time to prevent overlaps.
- Calendar Integration — Once all checks pass, the workflow automatically creates a booking entry in your Google Calendar, keeping everything synced and visible.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

### **🔄 Booking Flow (Step-by-Step)**

#### **Phase 1: Input Validation** 
```javascript
// Real validation logic from the workflow
✅ Name, email, phone, date, time validation
✅ Email format verification (RFC compliant)
✅ Phone number format checking
✅ Date/time format standardization (YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM)
```

#### **Phase 2: Business Logic Validation**
```javascript
// Business hours: Monday-Friday, 9AM-9PM (customizable)
✅ Weekend blocking
✅ Business hours enforcement  
✅ Lunch break exclusion (12PM-2PM)
✅ Dinner break exclusion (6PM-8PM)
✅ Timezone handling (Malaysia/UTC+8 default)
```

#### **Phase 3: Intelligent Conflict Detection**
```javascript
// Multi-calendar checking
✅ Public holiday calendar integration
✅ Main booking calendar conflict detection
✅ Real-time availability verification
✅ Overlap prevention algorithms
```

#### **Phase 4: Calendar Integration**
```javascript
// Google Calendar automation
✅ Event creation with attendee invitation
✅ Google Meet link generation
✅ Custom event descriptions and summaries
✅ Calendar color coding
```

### **🕒 Availability API Flow**

1. **Date Input** → Validates YYYY-MM-DD format
2. **Weekend/Holiday Check** → Blocks non-working days
3. **Slot Generation** → Creates available time slots
4. **Conflict Mapping** → Marks booked vs available slots
5. **Response Formatting** → Returns structured availability data

]
```

#### **Step 5: Activate & Test** 🚀

3. **Test with sample requests:**
```bash
# Test booking creation
curl -X POST 'https://your-n8n-domain/webhook/suarify-make-booking' \
