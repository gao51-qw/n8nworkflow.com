  "description": "## Template Description\n\nThis n8n workflow is designed to manage Fastmail masked email addresses using the Fastmail API. The workflow provides the following functionalities:\n\n1. **Retrieve all masked emails**: Fetches all masked email addresses associated with the Fastmail account.\n2. **Create masked email**: Allows creating a new masked email with a specified state (`pending`, `enabled`, etc.).\n3. **Update masked email state**: Updates the state of a masked email such as enabling, disabling, or deleting it.\n4. **Generate HTML template**: Constructs an HTML table to display the masked emails in a user-friendly format.\n\n## Steps to Make it Work\n\n1. **Webhook Node**: \n   - This node listens for incoming requests to manage masked emails.\n   - Needs Basic Authentication credentials to secure the endpoint.\n\n2. **Session Node**: \n   - Sends a request to obtain session information from Fastmail's API.\n   - Requires an HTTP Header Auth credential with your Fastmail API token.\n\n3. **Switch Node**: \n   - Routes the workflow based on the state of the incoming masked email request (`pending`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `deleted`).\n   \n4. **HTTP Request Nodes**:\n   - These nodes handle various Fastmail API calls for masked emails (get, set, update, delete).\n   - All HTTP Request nodes require an HTTP Header Auth credential attached, using the Fastmail API token.\n\n5. **Set Node**: \n   - Gathers the retrieved masked email list into an array for further processing.\n\n6. **HTML Node**: \n   - Generates an HTML template to render the masked email addresses in a table format.\n\n7. **Respond to Webhook Node**: \n   - Sends back the HTML table to the client in response to the webhook request.\n\n### Needed Credentials\n\n1. **Fastmail Masked E-Mail Addresses**:\n   - An API token from Fastmail's API.\n   - Each HTTP call to Fastmail requires this credential for authentication.\n\n## Note\n\n- Ensure that you correctly configure authentication for the API calls and webhook security.\n- Use your actual Fastmail API credentials with the correct scope.\n- The workflow assumes that the Fastmail API is correctly configured and accessible from your n8n instance.\n- Update URLs and credentials IDs according to your n8n configuration.",
