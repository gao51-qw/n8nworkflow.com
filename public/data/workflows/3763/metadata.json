  "description": "# Who is this for?\n\n**Everyone!** Did you dream of asking an AI \"*what hotel did I stay in for holidays last summer?*\" or \"*what were my marks last semester like?*\".\n\nDream no more, as [vector similarity searches](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings/) and **this workflow** are the foundations to make it possible (as long as the information appears in your e-mails 😅).\n\n## 100% Local and Open Source!\n\nThis workflow is designed to use locally-hosted open source. **Ollama** as LLM provider, `nomic-embed-text` as the embeddings model, and **pgvector** as the vector database engine, on top of **Postgres**.\n\n## Structured AND Vectorized\n\nThis workflow combines *structured* **and** *semantic* search on your e-mail.\n\nNo need for enterprise setups!\nLeverage the convenience of n8n and open source to get a **bleeding edge** solution.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. You will need a **PGVector database** with embeddings for all your email. Use my other template [Gmail to Vector Embeddings with PGVector and Ollama](https://n8n.io/workflows/3762-gmail-to-vector-embeddings-with-pgvector-and-ollama/) to set it up in a breeze!\n2. Make a copy of my [Email Assistant: Convert Natural Language to SQL Queries with Phi4-mini and PostgreSQL](https://n8n.io/workflows/3761-email-assistant-convert-natural-language-to-sql-queries-with-phi4-mini-and-postgresql/), you will need it for structured searches.\n3. Install this template and modify the *Call the SQL composer Workflow* step, to point at your copy of the SQL workflow.\n4. Adjust the rest of necessary steps: *Telegram Trigger*, *AI Chat model*, *AI Embeddings*...\n\n**Activate the workflow** and chat around!\n\n",
