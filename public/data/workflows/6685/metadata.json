  "description": "# Competitor Price & Feature Tracker for Real Estate Projects\n\n## Overview\nThis solution monitors competitor pricing and features for real estate projects by fetching data from a competitor API, parsing it, logging it to Google Sheets, and sending email alerts for significant price changes. It runs on a scheduled basis to keep real-time track of market trends.\n\n## Operational Process\n- **Set Cron**: Triggers the workflow on a scheduled basis (e.g., hourly).\n- **Fetch Competitor Data**: Performs GET requests to retrieve competitor pricing and feature data (e.g., https://api.competitor.com).\n- **Wait For Data**: Introduces a delay to ensure data is fully retrieved.\n- **Parse Data**: Processes and extracts relevant pricing and feature details.\n- **Log to Google Sheets**: Appends the parsed data to a Google Sheet for tracking.\n- **Check Price Change**: Evaluates if there’s a significant price change.\n- **Send Alert Email**: Sends an email notification if a price change is detected.\n- **No Action for Minor Changes**: Skips action if no significant price change is found.\n\n## Implementation Guide\n- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.\n- Configure the Cron node for the desired schedule (e.g., every hour).\n- Set up the HTTP node with the competitor API URL (e.g., https://api.competitor.com).\n- Configure Google Sheets integration and specify the log sheet.\n- Test with a sample API call and verify email alerts.\n- Adjust price change thresholds in the `Check Price Change` node as needed.\n\n## Requirements\n- HTTP request capability for API data retrieval.\n- Google Sheets API for data logging.\n- Email service (e.g., SMTP) for alerts.\n- n8n for workflow automation and scheduling.\n\n## Customization Options\n- Adjust the Cron schedule for different intervals (e.g., daily).\n- Modify the HTTP node to fetch additional competitor data (e.g., features, availability).\n- Customize email alert content in the `Send Alert Email` node.\n- Enhance Google Sheets log with additional fields (e.g., timestamp, competitor name).\n- Add Slack or WhatsApp notifications for additional alert channels.",
