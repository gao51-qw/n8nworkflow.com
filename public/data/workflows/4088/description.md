## Twitter (X) Thread Fetcher: Extract and Merge Tweets from Threads
### What it does

- **Thread Detection:** Automatically detects whether the provided Twitter link is a single tweet or a thread.
- **Tweet Extraction:** Fetches and returns the content of a single tweet, or gathers all tweets in a thread by retrieving the first tweet and all connected replies.
- **Thread Merging:** Merges all tweets in the correct order to reconstruct the complete thread, filtering out any empty results.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily trigger this workflow from other n8n workflows to automate Twitter thread extraction from various sources.

### How it works
- Accepts a Twitter link as input-either a single tweet or a thread.
- If the link is for a single tweet, fetches and returns the tweet content.
- If the link is for a thread, fetches the first tweet, then iteratively retrieves all connected replies that form the thread, ensuring only relevant tweets are included.
- Merges the first tweet and all subsequent thread tweets in order, filters out any empty results, and returns the complete thread.
- Uses [twitterapi.io](https://twitterapi.io) for all Twitter API requests.

### Set up steps
- Setup typically takes just a few minutes. You’ll need to configure your Twitter API credentials for [twitterapi.io](https://twitterapi.io).
- You can trigger this workflow manually for testing or call it from another workflow to automate thread fetching from sources like Notion, spreadsheets, or other platforms.
- For best results, create a separate workflow to gather Twitter links from your preferred source, then trigger this workflow to fetch and return the full thread.
