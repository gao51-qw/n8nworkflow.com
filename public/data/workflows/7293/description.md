# Daily Easy Redmine Task Digest to Microsoft Teams Channel

## Overview  
This workflow automatically collects newly assigned Easy Redmine tasks for a specific team and sends a concise, formatted summary to a Microsoft Teams channel each weekday morning. It’s designed to keep your team updated without manual copy-pasting or sifting through outdated information.  

Perfect for project managers, team leads, or consultants using Easy Redmine, this automation ensures that no high-priority or recent tasks are missed, improving transparency and daily planning.

## How it works  

- **Daily Trigger (8:30 AM on workdays):** Initiates the automation at a fixed schedule.  
- **Get Issues by Query:** Easy Redmine node retrieves all issues matching a saved filter   
- **Split Out Issues:** Breaks the received array of tasks into individual items for separate processing.  
- **Keep Relevant Fields & Add Link:** Filters to essential data (ID, author, subject, description) and creates a clickable issue link using URL concatenation.  
- **Run for Each Task:** Iterates over tasks to process and send individually.  
- **Message into Team Channel:** Uses the Microsoft Teams node to post formatted HTML content into the chosen channel.
