  "description": "## Overview\n- This workflow helps you compare Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash when extracting data from a PDF\n- This workflow extracts and processes the data within a PDF in **one single step**, **instead of calling an OCR and then an LLM”**\n\n\n## How it works\n- The initial 2 steps download the PDF and convert it to base64.\n- This base64 string is then sent to both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash to extract information.\n- This workflow is made to let you compare results, latency, and cost (in their dedicated dashboard).\n\n\n## How to use it\n- Set up your Google Drive if not already done\n- Select a document on your Google Drive\n- Modify the prompt in \"Define Prompt\" to extract the information you need and transform it as wanted.\n- Get a [Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and/or [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n- Note that you can deactivate one of the 2 API calls if you don't want to try both\n- Test the Workflow\n",
