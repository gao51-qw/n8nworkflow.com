🧠 How It Works
1. This AI Agent automatically qualifies property buyer leads from form submissions.
2. Form Submission Trigger
3. When a user submits their details via a property inquiry form, the workflow is triggered.
4. AI Lead Classification
5. The buyer's input (budget, location, timeline, etc.) is analyzed by OpenAI to extract structured data and generate a lead score (0–100).
6. Lead Qualification Logic
7. Leads with a score of 70 or above are marked as qualified, the rest are ignored or stored separately.
8. Follow-Up Action
9. Qualified leads trigger:
10. Email notification to the agent
11. Record creation in Airtable as CRM
