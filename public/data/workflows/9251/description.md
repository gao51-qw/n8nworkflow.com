## Who’s it for

This template is perfect for TikTok creators, content marketers, and social media teams who want to turn viral comments into engaging short-form videos without manually scripting, recording, or editing. If you want to keep up with trends and consistently publish high-quality avatar videos, this workflow automates the entire process from comment selection to enhanced final video.

## What it does

The workflow takes TikTok video URLs and their top comments from a Data Table, extracts the transcript using **Dumpling AI**, and uses **GPT-4** to write a natural and engaging TikTok script inspired by the comment. It then generates a full AI avatar video through **Captions.ai**, enhances it with subtitles and B-roll using **Submagic**, and finally saves all video details into **Airtable** for tracking.

Here’s what happens step by step:  
1. Pulls TikTok videos and their top comments from a Data Table  
2. Sends video URLs to **Dumpling AI** to retrieve transcripts  
3. Feeds both transcript and comment into **GPT-4** to generate a conversational TikTok script  
4. Cleans and formats the script using JavaScript  
5. Sends the script to **Captions.ai** to produce an AI avatar video  
6. Checks video status and retries if needed  
7. Enhances the final video with **Submagic** for captions and effects  
8. Receives the enhanced video via webhook and logs details into **Airtable**
