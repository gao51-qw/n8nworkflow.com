  "description": "## How it works\nThis template creates a fully automated \"hands-off\" pipeline for processing financial documents. It's perfect for small businesses, freelancers, or operations teams who want to stop manually entering invoice and receipt data.\n\nWhen you drop a new image/multiple images file into a specific Google Drive folder, this workflow automatically:\n1.  **Triggers** and downloads the new file.\n2.  **Performs OCR** on the file using a local AI model (`Nanonets-OCR-s`) to extract all the raw text.\n3.  **Cleans & Structures** the raw text using a second local AI model (`command-r7b`). This step turns messy text into a clean, predictable JSON object.\n4.  **Saves** the structured data (like `InvoiceNumber`, `TotalAmount`, `IssueDate`, etc.) to a new record in your Airtable base.\n5.  **Moves** the original file to a \"Done\" or \"Failed\" folder to keep your inbox clean and organized.\n\n## Requirements\n* **Google Drive Account:** For triggering the workflow and storing files.\n* **[Airtable Account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/Isr7G94S):** To store the final, structured data.\n* **Ollama (Local AI):** This template is designed to run locally for free. You must have Ollama running and pull two models from your terminal:\n    * `ollama pull benhaotang/Nanonets-OCR-s:F16`\n    * `ollama pull command-r7b:7b-12-2024-q8_0`\n\n## How to set up\nSetup should take about **10-15 minutes**. The workflow contains 7 sticky notes that will guide you step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Airtable:** Use the link in the main sticky note (`[1]`) to duplicate the Airtable base to your own account.\n2.  **Ollama:** Make sure you have pulled the two required models listed above.\n3.  **Credentials:** You will need to add three credentials in n8n:\n    * Your Google Drive (OAuth2) credentials.\n    * Your Airtable (Personal Access Token) credentials.\n    * Your Ollama credentials. (To do this, create an \"OpenAI API\" credential, set the **Base URL** to your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:11434/v1`), and use `ollama` as the **API Key**).\n4.  **Follow the Notes:** Click through the workflow and follow the numbered sticky notes (`[1]` to `[6]`) to connect your credentials and select your folders for each node.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n* **Use Cloud AI:** This template is flexible! You can easily swap the local Ollama models for a cloud provider (like OpenAI's GPT-4o or Anthropic's Claude 3). Just change the credentials and model name in the two AI nodes (`OpenAI Chat Model` and `Data Cleaner`).\n* **Add More Fields:** To extract more data (e.g., `SupplierVATNumber`), simply add the new field to the prompt in the `Data Cleaner` node and map it in the `AirTable - Create a record1` node.",
