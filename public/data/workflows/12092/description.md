## How It Works
Automates financial risk evaluation by intelligently consolidating information from five critical sources: financial, operational, legal, insurance, and regulatory systems. Hourly triggers enable continuous, AI-driven risk assessment using the OpenRouter Chat Model, producing dynamic risk scores while simultaneously identifying emerging compliance gaps and potential exposure areas. High-risk findings automatically initiate corrective actions, trigger secondary investigations, and send real-time alerts through Slack notifications as well as investor email updates. Designed for financial institutions, compliance teams, risk managers, and investment firms, it provides continuous, scalable, and fully data-driven monitoring of risk across complex regulatory and operational environments.
