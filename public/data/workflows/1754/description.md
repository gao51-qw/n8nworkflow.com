This workflow identifies new rows in Google Sheets using a separate column keeping track of already processed rows.

For this approach to work, the sheet needs to meet two requirements:
- A unique identifier for each row is required
- A column used to differentiate new/processed rows is present

Our example sheet looks like this:

So the row identifier is named `ID`, the new/processed column is called `Processed`. Update the workflow accordingly if your columns have different names.

Now if the workflow runs, it discovers all three rows as new. After processing them, it will add a timestamp to the Processed column:

The next time the workflow is executed it will skip the existing rows and only process newly added data:
