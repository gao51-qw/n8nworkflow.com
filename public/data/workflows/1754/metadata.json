  "description": "![image.png](fileId:652)\n\nThis workflow identifies new rows in Google Sheets using a separate column keeping track of already processed rows.\n\nFor this approach to work, the sheet needs to meet two requirements:\n- A unique identifier for each row is required\n- A column used to differentiate new/processed rows is present\n\nOur example sheet looks like this:\n\n![image.png](fileId:649)\n\nSo the row identifier is named `ID`, the new/processed column is called `Processed`. Update the workflow accordingly if your columns have different names.\n\nNow if the workflow runs, it discovers all three rows as new. After processing them, it will add a timestamp to the Processed column:\n\n![image.png](fileId:650)\n\nThe next time the workflow is executed it will skip the existing rows and only process newly added data:\n\n![image.png](fileId:648)\n\n![image.png](fileId:651)",
