## Daily Company News Bot
### This n8n template demonstrates how to use Free FinnHub API to retrieve the company news from a list stock tickers and post messages in Slack channel with a pre-scheduled time.

### How it works
* We firstly define the list of stock tickers you are interested
* Loop over items to call FinnHub API to get the latest company news for the ticker
* Then we format the company news as a markdown text content which could be sent to Slack
* Post a new message in Slack channel
* Wait for 5 seconds, then move to the next ticker

### How to use
* Simply setup a scheduler trigger to automatically trigger the workflow

### Requirements
* FinnHub API Key
* Slack channel webhook
