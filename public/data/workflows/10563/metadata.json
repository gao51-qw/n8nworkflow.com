  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis n8n template automates Walmart product discovery and sends clean results to Google Sheets on a fixed schedule (default: every 4 hours). It uses **ScrapeOps Proxy API** for resilient page fetches (with JS render + scroll) and **ScrapeOps Parser API** for structured data extraction (title, price, rating, reviews, image, URL, sponsored flag).
