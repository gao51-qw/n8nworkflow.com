## Overview
This n8n workflow automatically generates weekly performance reports for completed email campaigns from ManyReach, converts them to Google Docs, and shares them via Slack.

## Workflow Trigger
- **Schedule**: Runs every Monday (weekly)
- Automates the entire reporting process without manual intervention

## Process Flow

### 1. Data Collection

- **Filter**: Selects only campaigns that are both:
  - Active (`active = true`)
  - Completed (`campStatus = "completed"`)

### 2. Campaign Processing Loop
The workflow processes each filtered campaign individually:

1. **Fetch One Campaign**: Retrieves detailed data for the specific campaign
2. **Campaign Report Agent**: AI-powered analysis using GPT-4.1 that generates:
   - Executive summary with key highlights
   - Performance metrics (open rate, click rate, reply rate, conversion rate)
   - Email content analysis
   - Configuration insights
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Next steps

### 3. Report Generation

- **Set Details**: Prepares document metadata (name, content)
- **HTML → Magic 🪄**: Formats the HTML content for Google Drive upload with proper styling
