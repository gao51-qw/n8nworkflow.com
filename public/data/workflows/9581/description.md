Automatically turn incoming support emails into categorized, prioritized tasks in Dart—complete with AI-generated summaries, tags, and sender context.

## What It Does

This workflow captures emails from Gmail, uses an AI model to classify them into one of seven categories (e.g., Bug Report, Billing, Feature Request), and creates a structured task in Dart. Each task includes:

- **Title**: The email subject  
- **Tag**: Based on the detected category  
- **Priority**: Set by the AI based on content analysis  
- **Description**: Includes confidence level, rationale, summary, and the cleaned full email body  
- **Comment**: Automatically adds the sender’s name and email for easy reference

The workflow also parses and cleans the raw HTML email content, ensuring all data is readable and workflow-ready.

## Who's It For
