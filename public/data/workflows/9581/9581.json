    "description": "Automatically turn incoming support emails into categorized, prioritized tasks in Dart—complete with AI-generated summaries, tags, and sender context.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow captures emails from Gmail, uses an AI model to classify them into one of seven categories (e.g., Bug Report, Billing, Feature Request), and creates a structured task in Dart. Each task includes:\n\n- **Title**: The email subject  \n- **Tag**: Based on the detected category  \n- **Priority**: Set by the AI based on content analysis  \n- **Description**: Includes confidence level, rationale, summary, and the cleaned full email body  \n- **Comment**: Automatically adds the sender’s name and email for easy reference\n\nThe workflow also parses and cleans the raw HTML email content, ensuring all data is readable and workflow-ready.\n\n## Who's It For\n\nThis template is built for support and operations teams using Dart who want to streamline how incoming emails are sorted and turned into actionable tasks. It’s ideal for organizations managing multiple types of requests and updates from clients, partners, or systems.\n\n## How to Set Up\n\n1. Import the workflow into **n8n**  \n2. Connect your **Gmail** and **Dart** accounts\n3. Replace the dummy Dartboard ID with your actual board ID  \n4. Choose your preferred AI model (results may vary depending on model quality)\n5. If your target email address is in a google group, use the **Filter: \"Sender\"** in the Gmail trigger\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n account  \n- Connected Gmail and Dart account\n\n## How to Customize the Workflow\n\n- Modify the **category list** to match your team’s taxonomy  \n- Adjust the **AI classification prompt** to fine-tune tagging and prioritization    \n- Choose your preferred AI model",

Use the definitions and output schema provided below. Output only valid JSON that matches the schema exactly.\n\nDefinitions\n- Billing: Questions or disputes about charges, invoices, subscriptions, refunds, payment failures, billing address, tax, pricing plan changes, or account credits.\n- Feature Request: Suggestions for new features, changes to product behavior, wishlist items, or requests to add/change functionality.\n- Support Help Request: User reports of problems, errors, account access issues, setup/installation help, crashes, or anything asking for a fix or step-by-step assistance.\n- App Feedback: General feedback about experience, UI/UX suggestions not asking for a new feature, praise, complaints about design/tone/performance that do not request a fix or new functionality.\n- Bug Report: Reports describing reproducible software defects, unexpected behavior, incorrect outputs, or developer-facing error traces that require debugging and may need code fixes.\n- Task Updates: Notifications or status updates related to tasks, assignments, or workflow progress—especially from Dart or similar systems.\n- Unrelated: Emails that do not fit any of the above categories, such as promotions, marketing material, job applications, newsletters, or personal messages.\n\nRequired JSON output schema (must be followed exactly)\n{\n  \"category\": \"<one of: Billing|Feature Request|Support Help Request|App Feedback|Bug Report|Task Updates|Unrelated>\",\n  \"confidence\": <number between 0.0 and 1.0, strictly in numbers>,\n  \"rationale\": \"<one-sentence explanation of why this category was chosen>\",\n  \"summary\": \"<one-line summary of the user's request>\",\n  \"priority\": \"<low|medium|high|critical>\"\n}\n\n\n\nExample 1\nEmail: \"I was charged twice this month for my subscription. Please refund the duplicate charge and confirm when it’s processed.\"\nCategory: Billing\nConfidence: 0.96\nRationale: \"Mentions duplicate charge and explicitly requests a refund.\"\nSummary: \"User reports duplicate charge and requests refund confirmation.\"\nPriority: high\n\nExample 2\nEmail: \"It would be great if we could export project timelines as CSV and include custom fields.\"\nCategory: Feature Request\nConfidence: 0.92\nRationale: \"User asks for new export feature and specific fields to include.\"\nSummary: \"Request to add CSV export for timelines with custom fields.\"\nPriority: low\n\nExample 3\nEmail: \"App crashes every time I click Save on long tasks; I need help getting my data back.\"\nCategory: Support Help Request\nConfidence: 0.98\nRationale: \"Reports a reproducible crash and asks for help retrieving data.\"\nSummary: \"App crashes on Save for long tasks; user needs data recovery help.\"\nPriority: high\n\nExample 4\nEmail: \"Love the new color theme but the contrast on small text feels low; overall experience is much improved.\"\nCategory: App Feedback\nConfidence: 0.85\nRationale: \"Gives UI feedback and praise without requesting changes or fixes.\"\nSummary: \"Positive feedback on theme with a note about low contrast on small text.\"\nPriority: low\n\nExample 5\nEmail: \"When running the Code node, I get a stack trace: Error: Code doesn't return items properly at validateRunCodeAllItems ... Please advise.\"\nCategory: Bug Report\nConfidence: 0.95\nRationale: \"Provides a developer-facing stack trace and describes a reproducible failure in node execution.\"\nSummary: \"Code node throws validateRunCodeAllItems error with full stack trace.\"\nPriority: high\n\nExample 6\nEmail: \"Task #3421 has been marked complete. Please review the final notes and close the loop.\"\nCategory: Task Updates\nConfidence: 0.93\nRationale: \"Mentions a specific task ID and status update, typical of automated workflow notifications.\"\nSummary: \"Task #3421 marked complete; user asked to review and finalize.\"\nPriority: medium\n\nExample 7\nEmail: \"We’re hiring! Check out our open roles and apply today to join our team.\"\nCategory: Unrelated\nConfidence: 0.90\nRationale: \"Promotional job application email not related to product, support, or user feedback.\"\nSummary: \"Marketing email promoting open job roles.\"\nPriority: low\n\nInstructions\n- Read the email and map it to exactly one category.\n\n- If the email contains both billing and a technical problem, prioritize Billing if a payment dispute or refund is explicitly requested; otherwise prioritize Support Help Request.\n\n- Confidence Calibration\n0.95–1.00: Explicit intent (e.g., “refund,” “add feature,” “crash”).\n0.85–0.94: Strongly implied intent with supporting context.\n0.75–0.84: Somewhat implied or ambiguous.\n<0.75: Weak or uncertain match.\n\n- Priority Rules\ncritical – Use only when the issue completely prevents the user (or all users) from accessing core features, causes total data loss, or exposes a severe security or privacy risk. Typically urgent and business-blocking.\nExamples – “The app won’t load at all for any of our users.” / “All my project data disappeared after the update.” / “Sensitive user info is visible to others.”\n\nhigh – The issue directly affects core functionality, payments, or productivity but does not fully block all access. Includes reproducible crashes, failed payments, or broken workflows with financial or time impact.\nExamples – “I was charged twice this month for my subscription.” / “The app crashes whenever I click Save.” / “Checkout form gives an error and I can’t complete my purchase.”\n\nmedium – The issue or update affects secondary features, task progress, or non-critical operations. The user can still perform main tasks but with inconvenience or delay. Also applies to workflow notifications and status updates.\nExamples – “Task #2341 marked complete — please review.” / “The report export takes longer than usual.” / “Notifications stopped appearing, but the app still works.”\n\nlow – Minor or non-urgent matters that don’t affect functionality or access. Includes suggestions, praise, design opinions, and promotional or unrelated content.\nExamples – “Love the new theme, but text contrast is low.” / “It would be great if you could add dark mode.” / “We’re hiring! Apply today.”\n\n- Output only the JSON object and nothing else, matching the schema exactly.\n\nEmail: {{ $json.text }}",
