# How it works

1. **Input your proposal basics** - Manually enter the core details and key points for your proposal
2. **Dual AI processing** - OpenAI expands your inputs into a comprehensive draft, then Claude refines it for clarity and readability
3. **Automated document output** - The workflow copies your Google Doc template, replaces all variables with the AI-generated content, and delivers your finished proposal

# Set up steps

**Estimated time: 10-15 minutes**

1. **Create an OpenRouter account** - Sign up at OpenRouter to get API access for Claude
2. **Set up your Google Doc template** - Create a template document with placeholder variables (variable names are listed in the 'Update proposal' node)
3. **Configure API credentials** - Add your OpenAI and OpenRouter API keys to the workflow
4. **Connect Google Drive** - Authenticate your Google account to enable document creation

💡 Detailed configuration instructions and variable naming conventions can be found in the sticky notes within the workflow.
