### 📝 DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKFLOW

This workflow connects Salesforce and Geotab to streamline fleet tracking for field service jobs (Work Orders). When a new Work Order is created in Salesforce (with a 'New' status and valid coordinates), it creates a circular geofence zone in Geotab and updates the Work Order with the zone ID. If geolocation is missing, an alert email is sent to dedicated email.

The workflow uses a Salesforce Outbound Message to trigger an n8n webhook. It includes robust credential handling and optional logic to skip or notify on bad data.

**Use Cases:**

* Automating vehicle geofence setup for service visits
* Enhancing CRM-to-fleet system synchronisation
* Enforcing work orders data quality via alerts

**Integrations Used:**

* Salesforce
* Geotab API
* Microsoft Outlook (or any SMTP-compatible service)
