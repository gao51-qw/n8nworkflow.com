  "description": "Get ==Instant== Alerts When Your Website Goes Down — Using ==n8n== as ==Website Downtime Checker Robot==\n\nIf you manage websites (your own or clients’), downtime alerts are critical. But most monitoring tools create alert fatigue — ==emails for every tiny hiccup==, even 30–60 second outages.\nThis setup shows how to use n8n as a smart uptime monitor: \n✅ No extra subscriptions \n✅ No false-positive spam \n✅ Alerts only for real downtime \n✅ Optional instant phone notifications\n\nWhy Use n8n for Website Monitoring?\nTraditional tools like Uptime Robot become limiting or expensive as you scale.\nWith n8n, you get:\n* Full control over alert logic\n* Custom timing & thresholds\n* No forced notification rules\n* One tool for uptime and other automations\nYou decide when, how, and why alerts are sent.\n\n**Quick Start:** \nFree n8n Website Monitoring Workflow\nGet running in minutes:\n* Use the prebuilt n8n template\n* Sign up for n8n Cloud or self-host for free\n* Set your schedule (default: hourly)\n* Add the websites you want to monitor\n\n\n**Key Setting** (Important)\nWait time: ==300 seconds (5 minutes)==\n&gt;Recommended*\n\n If a site goes down, the workflow waits before alerting. \n➡️ Short hiccups = ignored \n➡️ Real outages = ==alerted==\n\n**How to Test & Use**\n1. Activate the workflow Toggle it on — monitoring runs automatically.\n2. Test instantly Add a fake or non-existent URL and run the workflow. After the wait period, you’ll receive an alert.\n3. Stay organized Alerts arrive cleanly in your inbox (Tip: pair with an AI email labeling workflow for color-coded alerts)\n\nGet Critical Alerts on Your Phone (Telegram)\nEmail is fine — but critical sites need instant mobile alerts.\nBest option: Telegram bots\n* Free\n* Fast\n* No extra APIs or subscriptions\n\n\nHow It Works\n* Create a Telegram bot via BotFather\n* Add the bot token & chat ID to n8n\n* Receive downtime alerts instantly on your phone\nNo missed notifications. No noise.\n\n\n**FAQ**\n* Can I monitor unlimited sites? \n&gt; ==Yes== — just add more URLs.\n\n* What about short downtime (seconds)?\n&gt; Filtered out by the 5-minute wait.\n\n* Do I need a paid n8n plan? \n&gt; ==No.== Self-hosting is ==free==, and this works on free plans.\n\n* Why not SMS or WhatsApp? \n&gt; **Telegram** is ==faster, simpler, and doesn’t require paid APIs.==\n\n\n\n📩 **Contact Me**\n\nIf you have any questions, ideas to share, or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out.
