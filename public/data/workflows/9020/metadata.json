  "description": "## Who’s it for\n\nFreelancers and agencies who track new Upwork leads via Vollna RSS and want clean logging to Google Sheets with instant Slack alerts.\n\n## What it does\n\nPolls a Vollna RSS feed every few minutes, parses each job (title, budget, link, skills, categories), dedupes against your sheet, appends only new jobs, and notifies Slack with a compact alert.\n\n## How it works\n\t1. Schedule Trigger fires on an interval.\n\t2. RSS Read pulls new items from Vollna.\n\t3. Filter (optional) skips non-ASCII titles.\n\t4. Code node normalizes fields (title/budget split, clean Upwork link, “Posted x mins ago”, etc.).\n\t5. Sheets Lookup + Compare prevents duplicates by job URL.\n\t6. Sheets Append writes new rows; Slack posts a job alert.\n\n## Set up\n\t1. In ⚙️ Config, set: VOLLNA_RSS_URL, GOOGLE_SHEETS_DOC_ID, GOOGLE_SHEET_NAME, SLACK_CHANNEL_ID, EMAIL_TO (optional).\n\t2. Add OAuth credentials for Google Sheets, Slack, and Gmail (optional).\n\t3. Create sheet columns: TITLE, BUDGET, UPWORK JOB LINK, CATEGORIES, SKILLS, DATE, JOB DESCRIPTION, POSTED.\n\t4. (Optional) Adjust polling interval on the Schedule Trigger.\n\n## Requirements\n\t• Vollna RSS feed URL (your tokenized link)\n\t• n8n (cloud or self-hosted) with Google Sheets + Slack creds\n\n## Customize\n\t• Remove the ASCII filter for broader coverage.\n\t• Swap Gmail/Slack with your preferred notifier.\n\t• Add keyword filters before appending to Sheets.",
