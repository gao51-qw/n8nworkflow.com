  "description": "# Compare AI Models with Nvidia API: Qwen, DeepSeek, Seed-OSS & Nemotron\n\n## Overview\n- Queries four AI models simultaneously via Nvidia's API in 2-3 seconds—4x faster than sequential processing. Perfect for ensemble intelligence, model comparison, or redundancy.\n\n\n## How It Works\n- Webhook Trigger receives queries\n- AI Router distributes to four parallel branches: Qwen2, SyncGenInstruct, DeepSeek-v3.1, and Nvidia Nemotron\n- Merge Node aggregates responses (continues with partial results on timeout)\n- Format Response structures output\n- Webhook Response returns JSON with all model outputs\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Nvidia API key from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) (free tier available)\n- n8n v1.0.0+ with HTTP access\n- Model access in Nvidia dashboard\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Import workflow JSON\n2. Configure HTTP nodes: Authentication → Header Auth → `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`\n3. Activate workflow and test\n\n## Customization\n\nAdjust temperature/max_tokens in HTTP nodes, add/remove models by duplicating nodes, change primary response selection in Format node, or add Redis caching for frequent queries.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nMulti-model chatbots, A/B testing, code review, research assistance, and production systems with AI fallback.\n",
