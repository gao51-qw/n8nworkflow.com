## How It Works
The workflow starts with a scheduled trigger that activates at set intervals. Behavioral data from multiple sources is parsed and sent to the MCDN routing engine, which intelligently assigns leads to the right teams based on predefined rules. AI-powered scoring evaluates each prospect’s potential, ensuring high-quality leads are prioritized. The results are synced to the CRM, and updates are reflected on an analytics dashboard for real-time visibility.
