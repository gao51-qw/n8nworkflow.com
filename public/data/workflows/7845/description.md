This n8n workflow demonstrates how to use AI to update your grocery list in Asana via Telegram chat or voice. 

## Use cases
- Update grocery list details in Asana eg. check or uncheck the items, update expiry dates, update quantities etc.

## How it works
- Instruct telegram bot (via chat or voice) to update a grocery item using natural language. For example, "we just bought 10 cartons of milk that expires in 6 months".
- If via text, just the text message will be sent to the Grocery Agent.
- If via voice, voice file will be downloaded then transcribed into text using OpenAI.
- Once Grocery agent receives the text, it will search the item in your grocery list in Asana. It will then check the item since it's bought, and update the quantity and expiry date accordingly.
- Once task is done, it will respond with the changes it made and insert a hyperlink to Asana if you want to see it.
