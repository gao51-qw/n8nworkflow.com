📰 Curate RSS Feeds into Daily Content Ideas via Email with Optional Notion Storage
Wake up to a burst of inspiration every morning! 🌞
🚀 What it does
🔄 Polls unlimited RSS feeds (blogs, YouTube, Substack, podcasts, you name it)
✍️ Re-writes each new headline into 5–10 scroll-stopping content angles
📧 Delivers a tidy email digest at 9 AM sharp (or whenever you choose)
🗂️ Auto-saves every idea into a Notion database (toggle on/off)

📐 Angles? Think “ready-made tweets”
An angle is a bite-sized spin on the original post.

Original RSS headline: “TikTok Rolls Out 15-Minute Videos”
Angle: “3 product-demo formats you can finally fit into TikTok’s new 15-min limit (+ templates)”
