How It Works

User sends a reminder request via Telegram (e.g., “Remind me to clean the garage tomorrow at 12 pm”).

The request is parsed by AI Agent and stored in Airtable with a unique reminder code.

The reminder workflow checks Airtable at scheduled intervals and sends a Telegram notification when the reminder is due.

Each reminder includes a unique cancel code (e.g., Reply 4936 to stop this reminder).

If the user replies with the code, the bot searches Airtable, deletes the reminder, and confirms the deletion in Telegram.

If the code doesn’t exist, the bot replies “Code not found.”

⚡ Setup Steps

Create a Telegram Bot

Use BotFather

Paste the JSON template.

Connect your Telegram and Airtable credentials.

Activate the Workflow

Start the workflow in n8n Cloud or Self-Hosted.

Send a test reminder in Telegram (e.g., “Remind me in 5 minutes to call mom”).

When notified, reply with the cancel code to test deletion.

Optional Customizations

Modify reminder frequency (Every 5 minutes node).

Change reminder message formatting in the Format Message node.

Add logging/analytics by connecting Google Sheets or another DB.
