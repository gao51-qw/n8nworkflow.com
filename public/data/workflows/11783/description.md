## How It Works
Automated daily scraping of competitor websites, pricing pages, job postings, and press releases feeds into an AI analyzer powered by OpenAI or Claude to extract trends, insights, and key metrics. The analyzed results are stored in Google Sheets for historical tracking and longitudinal comparison, and are automatically shared with stakeholders via email or WhatsApp. This workflow eliminates manual competitive research, enabling product teams and executives to monitor market movements efficiently and make timely, data-driven decisions.

## Setup Steps
1. Configure the daily schedule trigger.
2. Define competitor URLs using workflow variables.
3. Add and configure the OpenAI or Claude API key.
4. Authenticate Google Sheets using the appropriate credentials.
5. Connect Gmail and WhatsApp Business API tokens.
6. Test each scraper individually before enabling full automation.
