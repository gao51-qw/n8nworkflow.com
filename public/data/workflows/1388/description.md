A goal for 2022 is to write 1 thing I do each day. Combined with [this workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1387) you will get daily messages via Telegram and when you reply to them they will be saved in a Google Sheet.

***Note: Make sure to configure your Telegram and Google Sheet credentials! You will also need to modify the functions to have your Telegram username and bot name.***
