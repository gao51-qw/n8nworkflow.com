## Use Case
Automate image replacement in Google Docs:
- You need to update document images dynamically
- You want to create multiple versions of a template with different images
- You need to batch process document images from a URL database
- You want to generate shareable documents with custom images

## What this Workflow Does
The workflow automates image replacement in Google Docs:
- Accepts image URLs from your database
- Finds and replaces images in template documents
- Creates new document copies with updated images
- Optionally converts to PDF and makes documents shareable

## Setup
1. Connect your image URL database (column name must be "url")
2. Set up [Google Docs OAuth 2 API credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledocs/)
3. Optional: Create a template document in Google Drive with placeholder images
4. Optional: Configure [Google Drive authentication](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/) for additional features

## How to Adjust it to Your Needs
- Remove template copying for single document processing
- Adjust image ID selection for documents with multiple images
- Configure sharing settings and download formats
- Customize file naming and storage location
