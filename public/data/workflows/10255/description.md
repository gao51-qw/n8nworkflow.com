This n8n template automatically transcribes GoHighLevel (GHL) call recordings and creates an AI-generated summary that is added as a note directly to the related contact in your GHL CRM.

It’s designed for real estate investors, agencies, and sales teams that handle a large volume of client calls and want to keep detailed, searchable notes without spending hours on manual transcription.

## How it works
1. A **HighLevel automation workflow** triggers when a call is marked “Completed” and automatically sends a webhook to n8n.   
2. The n8n workflow receives this webhook and waits briefly to ensure the call recording is ready.    
3. It retrieves the **conversation and message IDs** from the webhook payload.  
4. The call recording is fetched from GHL’s API.  
5. An **AI transcription node** converts the audio to text.  
6. A **summarization node** condenses the transcript into bullet points or a concise paragraph.  
7. A **Code node** formats the AI output into proper JSON for GHL’s “Create Note” endpoint.  
8. Finally, an **HTTP Request node** posts the summary to the contact’s record in GHL.

## How to set up
1. Add your **GoHighLevel OAuth credential** and connect your agency account.  
2. Add your **AI credential** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini).  
3. Replace the sample webhook URL with your n8n endpoint.   
5. Test with a recent call and confirm the summary appears in the contact timeline.

## Requirements
* GoHighLevel account with API and OAuth access    
* AI service for transcription and summarization (e.g., OpenAI Whisper + GPT)

## Customizing this workflow
You can tailor this automation for your specific team or workflow:  
* Add sentiment analysis or keyword extraction to the summary.  
* Change the AI prompt to focus on “action items,” “objections,” or “next steps.”  
* Send summaries to Slack, Notion, or Google Sheets for reporting.  
* Trigger follow-up tasks automatically in your CRM based on keywords.

**Good to know**
* AI transcription and summarization costs vary by provider — check your LLM’s pricing.  
* GoHighLevel’s recording availability may take up to 1 minute after the call ends; adjust the delay accordingly.  
* For OAuth setup help, refer to GHL’s [OAuth documentation](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/OAuth2.0/index.html).
