This n8n template auto-enriches brand-new HubSpot contacts with company details. Each day it finds contacts created in the last 24 hours (skipping free email domains), researches the company from the contact’s email domain, and writes back clean fields—no manual lookup needed.

Perfect for GTM teams that want better segmentation and faster personalization from day one.

## How it works

* A **daily schedule trigger** starts the workflow.
* **HubSpot: Get recently created/updated contacts** pulls the newest records.
* A **filter** keeps only contacts:

  * created **within the last 24 hours**
  * whose email domain **doesn’t contain `gmail.com`** (adjust as needed).
* An **AI research agent (Gemini + SerpAPI)**:

  * extracts the company domain from the contact’s email
  * searches the web and returns **structured JSON**:

    * `company_name`, `industry`, `headquarters_city`, `headquarters_country`, `employee_count`, `website`, `linkedin`, `description`
* **HubSpot: Add company info** updates the contact with the enriched fields.

## Notes & customization

* **Free domains:** Add more exclusions (e.g., `yahoo.com`, `outlook.com`) to reduce false positives.
* **Confidence gating:** Require website + LinkedIn before writing to HubSpot, or route low-confidence results for manual review.
* **Field mapping:** Extend the update step with additional properties (e.g., industry tags, HQ timezone).
* **Frequency:** Switch the trigger to hourly for faster enrichment on high-volume inbound.
* **Data hygiene:** Normalize employee count ranges and country names to your CRM picklists.
