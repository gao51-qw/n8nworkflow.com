This workflow retrieves all users from n8n, compares them against entries in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, and automatically creates new users when needed.  

Once new users are created, invitation emails are sent automatically.  

You can trigger the workflow manually or set it to run on a schedule to ensure continuous synchronization.  

### Spreadsheet Template  
This workflow is designed to work with a Google Sheets structure inspired by Squarespace's newsletter block connection. You can modify the node settings to adapt to a different column format.
