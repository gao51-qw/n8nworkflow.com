  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis template describes a possible approach to handle a pseudo-callback/trigger from an independent, external process (initiated from a workflow) and combine the received input with the workflow execution that is already in progress.  This requires the external system to pass through some context information (`resumeUrl`), but allows the \"primary\" workflow execution to continue with **BOTH** its own (previous-node) context, **AND** the input received in the \"secondary\" trigger/process.\n\n### Primary Workflow Trigger/Execution\nThe workflow path from the `primary trigger` initiates some external, independent process and provides \"context\" which includes the value of `$execution.resumeUrl`. This execution then reaches a `Wait` node configured with `Resume - On Webhook Call`  and stops until a call to `resumeUrl` is received.\n\n### External, Independent Process\nThe external, independent process could be anything like a Telegram conversation, or a web-service as long as:\n1. it results in a single execution of the `Secondary Workflow Trigger`, and\n2. it can pass through the value of `resumeUrl` associated with the `Primary Workflow Execution`\n\n### Secondary Workflow Trigger/Execution\nThe `secondary workflow execution` can start with any kind of trigger as long as part of the input can include the `resumeUrl`.  To combine / rejoin the `primary workflow execution`, this execution passes along whatever it receives from its trigger input to the resume-webhook endpoint on the `Wait` node.\n\n## Notes\n* **IMPORTANT**: The workflow ids in the `Set` nodes marked **Update Me** have embedded references to the workflow IDs in the original system.  **They will need to be CHANGED to make this demo work.**\n* Note: The `Resume Other Workflow Execution` node in the template uses the `$env.WEBHOOK_URL` configuration to convert to an internal \"localhost\" call in a Docker environment.  This can be done differently.\n* **ALERT:** This pattern is NOT suitable for a workflow that handles multiple items because the first workflow execution will only be waiting for one callback.\n* The second workflow (not the second trigger in the first workflow) is just to demonstrate how the `Independent, External Process` needs to work.\n",
