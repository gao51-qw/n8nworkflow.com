## What this workflow does

This template extracts high-intent SEO keywords from any web page and turns them into a ranked keyword list you can use for content planning, landing pages, and SEO strategy.

It runs in 3 phases:

***1. Scrape the target URL*** with Decodo [Decodo – Web Scraper for n8n](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD)

***2. Use AI to extract seed keywords*** and understand the page topic

***3. Enrich each seed keyword with real Google SERP data via SerpApi*** (related searches + questions + competitors), then apply a JavaScript scoring system to rank the best opportunities

The final output is saved to Google Sheets as a clean table of ranked keywords.
