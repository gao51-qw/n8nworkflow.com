  "description": "\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of researching companies by gathering relevant data such as traffic volume, foundation details, funding information, founders, and more.\n\nThe workflow leverages the [ProspectLens API](https://prospectlens.net), which is particularly useful for researching companies commonly found on Crunchbase and LinkedIn.\n\n**ProspectLens** is an API that provides very detailed company data. All you need to do is supply the company's domain name.\n\nYou can obtain your ProspectLens API key here:\n[https://apiroad.net/marketplace/apis/prospectlens](https://apiroad.net/marketplace/apis/prospectlens)\n\nIn n8n, create a new \"HTTP Header\" credential. Set `x-apiroad-key` as the \"Name\" and enter your APIRoad API key as the \"Value\". Use this credential in the HTTP Request node of the workflow.\n\n\n![20240823 at 18.27.png](fileId:832)\n",
