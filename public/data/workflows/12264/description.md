## Overview

It helps content creators, marketers, and agencies repurpose long-form video content into blog posts and social media updates automatically.

## How it works

1. Fetches the transcript from a YouTube video  
2. Uses AI to generate blog and social media content  
3. Optionally waits for manual approval  
4. Publishes content to selected platforms  
5. Logs the result for tracking

## Setup steps

2. Paste a YouTube video URL
3. Choose auto-publish or approval mode
4. Run the workflow

## Use cases
