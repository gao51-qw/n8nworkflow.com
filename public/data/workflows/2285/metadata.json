  "description": "## Purpose\nThis workflow enables you to listen to your recent favorites in very hight quality offline without sacrificing all of your storage.\n\n## How it works\nThis workflow automatically creates a playlist in Spotify named \"Downloads\" which periodically gets updated so it always contains only a defined amount of the latest liked songs.\n\nThis enables only the Downloads playlist to set for automatic downloading and thus free up space on the device.\n\n## Setup\n- The workflow is ready to go. Just select your Spotify credentials and activate the workflow.\n- In Spotify just enable automatic downloads on the automatically created Downloads folder after the first workflow run.\n\n## Current limitations\nThis setup currently supports a maximum of 50 songs in the Downloads Playlist. This is due to the paylod limits defined by Spotify encountered in the *Get liked songs* node. Implementing batching would solve the issue.",
