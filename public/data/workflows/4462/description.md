How it works:
- **Schedule Trigger** on a daily basis (configured at 7.30 am)
- **Connects Google Contacts** to get personal information from them
- **Field Checker** on birthday date & firstnames. And see if there is any celebration for today
- **Send a Telegram Notification** and display the message on a Google Home Speaker via Home Assistant if any celebration has matched

Set up steps:
- **Download** the workflow and **import** it into your n8n instance
- **Configure accounts** for Google Contacts, Telegram and Home Assistant
- And you will be good to go
