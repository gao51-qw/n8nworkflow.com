### Who this is for?

The LinkedIn Profile Extract and JSON Resume Builder is a powerful workflow that scrapes professional profile data from LinkedIn using Bright Data's infrastructure, then transforms that data into a clean, structured JSON resume using Google Gemini. The workflow is ideal for automating resume parsing, candidate profiling, or integrating into recruiting platforms.

This workflow is tailored for:

- HR professionals & recruiters automating resume screening

- Talent acquisition platforms enriching candidate profiles

- Developers & AI builders creating resume-parsing AI pipelines

- Data scientists working on labor market analytics

- Growth hackers profiling prospects via public data

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Parsing resumes or LinkedIn profiles into machine-readable formats is often a manual, error-prone process. Most scraping tools either fail due to anti-bot protections or return unstructured HTML that's hard to work with.

This workflow solves that by:

- Using Bright Data's Web Unlocker for reliable, CAPTCHA-free LinkedIn scraping

- Extracting clean text and structured profile data via Google Gemini LLM

- Automatically generating a standards-compliant JSON Resume and Skills

- Sending the resume to webhooks or storing it for downstream usage

### What this workflow does

- Accepts LinkedIn Profile URL and required metadata (Bright Data zone, webhook)

- Scrapes LinkedIn profile using Bright Data Web Unlocker

- Extracts clean content and skills using Google Gemini LLM

- Builds a JSON-formatted resume following the JSON resume schema

- Sends the JSON resume via Webhook Notification

- Persists the output by saving the file to disk
