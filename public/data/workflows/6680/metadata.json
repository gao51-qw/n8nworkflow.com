This smart, scalable n8n workflow helps HR/TA teams streamline hiring decisions while keeping results structured, auditable, and easy to share.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who’s it for\n\nThis workflow is designed for:\n- HR or Talent Acquisition (TA) teams handling **multiple candidates** per role\n- Recruiters who want **AI-assisted resume screening** to save time and reduce bias\n- Organizations that want to **automatically log evaluations** and keep stakeholders updated in real-time via Slack or Sheets\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\n1. HR/TA uploads multiple candidate resumes and selects a job role\n2. Each resume is:\n   - Uploaded to Google Drive\n   - Parsed with GPT-4 to extract structured profile data\n3. The job description for the selected role is:\n   - Retrieved from Google Sheets\n   - Downloaded from Drive and parsed\n4. The profile + JD are sent to an AI agent to generate:\n   - Fit score\n   - Strengths & gaps\n   - Final recommendation\n5. Results are:\n   - Appended to the evaluation tracking sheet\n   - Optionally shared with the hiring team on Slack\n   - Used to trigger emails to qualified or unqualified candidates\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to set up\n\n1. **Clone or import the workflow** into your n8n instance\n2. **Connect your integrations**:\n   - Google Sheets (positions & evaluation form)\n   - Google Drive (CV & JD folders)\n   - OpenAI API (GPT-4)\n   - Slack (for notifications)\n   - (Optional) SendGrid or SMTP for email notifications\n3. **Update Google Sheets structure**:\n   - `Positions` sheet: maps Job Role → JD file link\n   - `Evaluation form`: stores evaluation results\n4. **Prepare Drive folders**:\n   - `/cv` folder for uploaded resumes\n   - `/jd` folder for job description PDFs\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- ✅ n8n (hosted or self-hosted)\n- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 account (used in Profile & JD evaluator agents)\n- ✅ Google Drive + Google Sheets access\n- ✅ Slack workspace + bot token\n- (Optional) SendGrid or email credentials for candidate follow-up\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 How to customize the workflow\n\n- Change the **fit score threshold** in the `Candidate qualified?` node\n- Edit Slack message content/formatting to match your company tone\n- Add additional candidate metadata to Sheets or Slack messages\n- Use a webhook trigger to integrate with your ATS or job board\n- Swap GPT-4 with Claude or Gemini if you prefer other AI services\n- Expand to include multi-position batch screening logic\n\n---\n\nHappy Hiring! 🚀  \n_Automated with love using [n8n](https://n8n.io)_",
