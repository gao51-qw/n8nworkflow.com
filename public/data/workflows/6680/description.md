## 👤 Who’s it for

This workflow is designed for:
- HR or Talent Acquisition (TA) teams handling **multiple candidates** per role

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. HR/TA uploads multiple candidate resumes and selects a job role
2. Each resume is:
   - Uploaded to Google Drive
   - Parsed with GPT-4 to extract structured profile data
3. The job description for the selected role is:
   - Retrieved from Google Sheets
   - Downloaded from Drive and parsed
4. The profile + JD are sent to an AI agent to generate:
   - Fit score
   - Strengths & gaps
   - Final recommendation
5. Results are:
   - Appended to the evaluation tracking sheet
   - Optionally shared with the hiring team on Slack
   - Used to trigger emails to qualified or unqualified candidates
