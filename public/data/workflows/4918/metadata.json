  "description": "This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.\n\nWho is this for?\nThis workflow is for restaurant owners, marketing managers, and any business owner who wants to automate the creation of high-quality, research-driven email newsletters. It's designed to save hours of manual work by leveraging AI to handle content generation, from initial idea to final send.\n\nIf you want to consistently engage your customers with fresh, relevant content but lack the time for research and writing, this template is your all-in-one solution.\n\nWhat does this workflow do?\nThis is a comprehensive, multi-agent system that automates the entire email marketing process. It begins with a simple prompt from you and ends with a polished newsletter sent to your Mailchimp subscribers.\n\nInitiates on a Schedule: A fully customizable Cron trigger starts the process by sending you a message on Telegram.\n\nAsks for Your Input: The Telegram bot asks you for a single topic for the upcoming newsletter (e.g., \"healthy eating,\" \"weekend specials,\" or \"new cocktail menu\").\n\nConducts AI-Powered Research: Once you reply, an AI agent researches your topic using Tavily, focusing on current industry trends, food culture, and customer interests to ensure your content is fresh and relevant.\n\nPlans the Content: The AI generates a complete table of contents for the newsletter, structuring it into engaging sections.\n\nWrites Each Section: A dedicated AI research team then writes detailed, engaging content for each section of the newsletter, weaving in your restaurant's unique brand voice.\n\nAssembles the Final Draft: The workflow aggregates all the generated sections into a complete newsletter draft, including a compelling subject line and a full body of text.\n\nRequests Final Approval: It sends the complete draft to you via Telegram for a final \"Approved\" or \"Denied\" confirmation. If you provide feedback, an AI editor will revise the draft.\n\nSends to Mailchimp: Once approved, the workflow automatically creates a new campaign in Mailchimp and sends the final, polished email to your subscriber list.\n\nSetup\nTo get this workflow running, you will need to configure a few credentials and settings.\n\nSet Up Credentials: In your n8n instance, add credentials for the following services:\n\nTelegram\n\nOpenAI\n\nTavily\n\nAnthropic\n\nMailchimp (using HTTP Basic Auth with any_string as the username and your Mailchimp API key as the password).\n\nConfigure the Telegram Bot:\n\nCreate a Telegram bot using BotFather and obtain its API token.\n\nFind your personal Chat ID by messaging a bot like @get_id_bot.\n\nIn the HITL (Human in the Loop) Telegram node, insert your Chat ID.\n\nConfigure Mailchimp:\n\nIn the Create_Campaign HTTP Request node, find the recipients section and replace the placeholder list_id with your actual Mailchimp Audience ID.\n\nCustomize the System Prompts: This is the most important step for personalization.\n\nGo into the AI Agent and OpenAI nodes (e.g., \"Restaurant Newsletter Expert,\" \"Newsletter Section Planner,\" \"Restaurant Content Research Team\").\n\nIn the system prompts, replace all instances of (insert restaurant name), (insert cuisine type), etc., with your own business details. This is where you inject your unique brand, menu, and voice into the AI.\n\nHow to customize this workflow\nThis template is powerful out of the box but is also designed to be highly flexible.\n\nChange the Schedule: Modify the Cron trigger to run at any interval you prefer (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or on specific days).\n\nAdjust the AI Models: You can easily swap the OpenAI or Anthropic models used in the workflow to different ones (e.g., change from GPT-4o-mini to GPT-4 Turbo) to balance cost and performance.\n\nUse a Different Notification Service: Replace the Telegram nodes with Slack, email, or another service for the approval process.\n\nIntegrate a Different Email Platform: Adapt the final HTTP Request nodes to work with another email marketing provider like SendGrid, ConvertKit, or Brevo by changing the API endpoints and authentication.\n\nRefine the AI's Personality: The core of the workflow is in the system prompts. By editing the prompts in the AI nodes, you can completely change the tone, style, and output of the generated content to perfectly match your brand.",
