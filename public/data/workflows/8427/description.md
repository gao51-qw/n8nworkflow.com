Additionally, the workflow will notify the user on Telegram before a trade is executed, giving the user 1 minute to cancel the trade before the workflow proceeds. 

Transaction are executed via MetaMask's Delegation Framework, so trades are fully non-custodial, you retain full control of your assets at all times.
