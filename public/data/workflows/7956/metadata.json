  "description": "**Automatically process Construction Blueprints into structured Google Sheets entries with VLM extraction**\n\n**What this workflow does**\n\n1. **Monitors Google Drive** for new blueprints in a target folder  \n2. **Downloads the file** inside n8n for processing  \n3. **Sends the file to VLM Run** for VLM analysis  \n4. **Fetches details** from the `construction.blueprint` domain as JSON  \n5. **Appends normalized fields** to a Google Sheet as a new row\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:** Google account, VLM Run API credentials, Google Sheets access, n8n. Install the verified **VLM Run** node by searching for **VLM Run** in the node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can start using it in your workflows.\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\n1. Create the Drive folder you want to watch and copy its Folder ID  \n2. Create a Google Sheet with headers like: `timestamp, file_name, file_id, mime_type, size_bytes, uploader_email, document_type, document_number, issue_date, author_name, drawing_title_numbers, revision_history, job_name, address, drawing_number, revision, drawn_by, checked_by, scale_information, agency_name, document_title, blueprint_id, blueprint_status, blueprint_owner, blueprint_url`\n\n3. Configure Google Drive OAuth2 for the trigger and download nodes  \n4. Add VLM Run API credentials from https://app.vlm.run/dashboard to the VLM Run node  \n5. Configure Google Sheets OAuth2 and set Spreadsheet ID and target sheet tab  \n6. Test by uploading a sample file to the watched Drive folder and activate\n\n## Perfect for\n\n- Converting uploaded construction blueprint documents into clean text  \n- Organizing extracted blueprint details into structured sheets  \n- Quickly accessing key attributes from technical files  \n- Centralized archive of blueprint-to-text conversions  \n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **End to end automation** from Drive upload to structured Sheet entry  \n- **Accurate text extraction** of construction blueprint documents  \n- **Organized attribute mapping** for consistent records  \n- **Searchable archives** directly in Google Sheets  \n- **Hands-free processing** after setup  \n\n## How to customize\n\n**Extend by adding:**\n\n* Version control that links revisions of the same drawing and highlights superseded rows\n* Confidence scores per extracted field with threshold-based routing to manual or AI review\n* Auto-generate a human-readable summary column for quick scanning of blueprint details\n* Split large multi-sheet PDFs into per-drawing rows with individual attributes\n* Cross-system sync to Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, or BIM 360 for project-wide visibility\n",
