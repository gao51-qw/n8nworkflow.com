# Upload bulk records from CSV - Airtable Interfaces

> This workflow is a supporting automation to a common Airtable situation, that as of this writing, has no direct solution but has great demand.

Interfaces are your secret weapon for managing a variety of tasks – from sales funnels and task tracking to creating dynamic dashboards. But here's a common situation: how do you efficiently bulk upload records (like contacts, leads, or clients) from an interface with just a click? Once set up, you'll be able to upload CSV files directly to your tables from the Interfaces with ease.


Workflow Key Points:
