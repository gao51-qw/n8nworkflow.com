  "description": "## Overview\nThis workflow automates quiz delivery from a Google Sheet directly into a Telegram group. It ensures that quizzes are posted one by one as polls, and once a quiz is sent, its status in the sheet is automatically updated to prevent duplication. If no pending quiz is available, the workflow notifies a separate Telegram channel to refill the sheet.\n\n## Target Audience\nThis template is designed for teachers, community managers, and Telegram group admins who want an easy way to run quizzes, trivia games, or knowledge checks without manual posting.\n\n## Problem It Solves\nManually sending quizzes is repetitive and prone to mistakes (like re-posting the same question). This template ensures quizzes are sent in order, tracked, and managed automatically with minimal human effort.\n\n## Requirements\n- An active Google account with Google Sheets enabled  \n- A Telegram bot token (via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))  \n- Chat IDs for both the quiz group and the notification group  \n\n## Google Sheet Structure\nCreate a sheet with the following columns:  \nquiz_number | question | option_a | option_b | option_c | option_d | status\n\n- **status**: Use 🟨 for pending quizzes, ✅ once completed  \n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Copy the workflow into your n8n instance.  \n2. Add your Google Sheets credentials.  \n3. Replace the `YOUR_SHEET_ID` placeholder with your sheet ID.  \n4. Set environment variables:  \n   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`  \n   - `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (for the group)  \n   - `TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_ID` (for refill notifications)  \n5. Run the workflow.  \n\n## Customization Options\n- Adjust the sheet name if not using “Sheet1”  \n- Change emoji markers (🟨 / ✅) to your preferred system  \n- Modify the Telegram notification message  \n",
