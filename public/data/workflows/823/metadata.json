  "description": "This workflow can be used to save all of your workflows in:\n1. a raw state (as a json file in Dropbox)\n2. an Airtable base, in a pre-designed format.\n\nIt runs periodically (currently, every 30 minutes) and either updates (if already existing in Airtable) or creates a new record in Airtable for each workflow.\n\nHere's the Airtable base to give you an idea:\n\n**[View Airtable base](https://airtable.com/shr9jexYomxygFSag)**\n\n**Note: This workflows uses the \"http://localhost:5678/rest\" API which the UI editor uses but is still not officially supported.
