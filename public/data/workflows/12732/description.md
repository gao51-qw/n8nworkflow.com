## How It Works
This workflow automates financial transaction surveillance by monitoring multiple payment systems, analyzing transaction patterns with AI, and triggering instant fraud alerts. Designed for finance teams, compliance officers, and fintech operations, it solves the challenge of real-time fraud detection across high-volume transaction streams without manual oversight. The system continuously fetches transactions from banking APIs and payment gateways via scheduled triggers or webhooks. Each transaction flows through validation layers checking for irregular amounts, velocity patterns, and geolocation anomalies. AI models analyze transaction metadata against historical patterns to calculate fraud risk scores. High-risk transactions trigger immediate alerts to designated teams via Gmail and Slack, while audit trails are logged to Google Sheets for compliance documentation. Approved transactions proceed to reconciliation, aggregating financial reports automatically. This eliminates delayed fraud discovery, reduces false positives through intelligent scoring, and ensures regulatory compliance through comprehensive audit logging.
