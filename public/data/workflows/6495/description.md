Shopify Order Data to Airtable

This n8n template demonstrates how to capture incoming Shopify order webhooks, transform the data into a structured format, and insert each product line item as a separate record in an Airtable sheet. It provides both high-level order information and detailed product-level metrics, making it ideal for analytics, reporting, inventory management, and customer insights.

Good to Know

Airtable API Rate Limits: By default, Airtable allows 5 requests per second per base. Consider batching or adding delays if you process high volumes of orders.

Shopify Webhook Configuration: Ensure you have configured the orders/create webhook in your Shopify Admin to point to the n8n webhook node.

Field Mapping: The template maps standard Shopify fields; if your store uses custom order or line item properties, update the Function nodes accordingly.

How It Works

Webhook Trigger: A Shopify orders/create webhook fires when a new order is placed.

Normalize Order Data: The Function node extracts core order, customer, shipping, and billing details and computes financial totals (subtotal, tax, shipping, discounts).

Line Item Breakdown: A second Function node builds an array of objects—one per line item—calculating per-item totals, tax/shipping allocation, and product attributes (color, size, material).

Check Customer Record: Optionally check against an Airtable "Customers" sheet to flag new vs existing customers.

Auto-Increment Record ID: A Function node generates a running serial number for each Airtable record.

Insert Records: The Airtable node writes each line item object into the target base and table, creating rich records with both order-level and product-level details.

How to Use

Airtable Node: Set up your Airtable API key and select the base and table.

Review Field Names: Match the field names in the Function nodes to the columns in your Airtable table.

Activate Workflow: Turn on the workflow and place a test order in your Shopify store.

Verify Records: Check your Airtable sheet to see the new order and its line items.

Customizing This Workflow

Add Custom Fields: Extend the Functions to include additional Shopify metafields, discounts, or customer tags.

Alternative Destinations: Replace the Airtable node with Google Sheets, Supabase, or another database by swapping in the corresponding node.

Error Handling: Insert If/Wait nodes to retry on API failures or send notifications on errors.

Multi-Currency Support: Adapt the currency logic to convert totals based on dynamic exchange rates.

Shopify Customer Append/Update to Airtable

This n8n template shows how to take incoming Shopify customer webhooks (create or update), check if the customer exists in your Airtable "Customers" sheet, append new details or update existing records, and maintain a clean customer database.

Good to Know

Airtable API Rate Limits: Airtable limits to 5 requests per second. Use batch lookups or add delays for high throughput.

Shopify Webhook Events: Configure both customers/create and customers/update webhooks in Shopify Admin.

Unique Identifier: Ensure the "Customer ID" field in Airtable matches the Shopify customer.id for reliable updates.

How It Works

Webhook Trigger: Fires on Shopify customers/create or customers/update events.

Extract Customer Data: A Function node normalizes name, email, phone, and address fields from the webhook payload.

Fetch Existing Records: The Airtable node lists all records from the "Customers" table to find a matching Customer ID.

Identify Match: A Function node compares the incoming customer.id to existing records and flags found vs. not found.

Return Last Row: Ensures serial numbering continuity by grabbing the last record's serial in Airtable.

Auto-Increment Serial: A Function node increments the serial number (S No) for new records.

Upsert Record: Depending on match result, the Airtable node either updates the existing record or creates a new one with full details.

How to Use

Import the Workflow: Click "Use Template" in n8n.

Set Credentials:

Shopify: Add store domain and webhook secret.

Airtable: Provide API key and select base/table.

Ensure Field Alignment: The Airtable table must have fields: Customer ID, Name, Email, Phone, Address, and S No.

Activate: Enable the workflow and test by creating or updating a customer in Shopify.

Verify: Your Airtable sheet will show appended or updated customer records with correct serial numbering.

Customizing This Workflow

Extra Fields: Modify the Function nodes to include Shopify metafields or tags.

Alternative Databases: Swap in Google Sheets, Supabase, or SQL nodes.

Error Notification: Add a Slack or email node to alert on webhook or API errors.

Batch Processing: Use the SplitInBatches node to handle large customer syncs.
