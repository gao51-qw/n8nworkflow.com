# N8n OpenAI-Compatible API Endpoints

Transform your n8n workflows into OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, allowing you to access multiple workflows as selectable AI models through a single integration.

## What This Does

This workflow creates two API endpoints that mimic the OpenAI API structure:

- `/models` - Lists all n8n workflows tagged with `aimodel` (or any other tag of your choice)
- `/chat/completions` - Executes chat completions with your selected workflows, supporting both text and stream responses 

## Benefits

**Access Multiple Workflows**: Connect to all your n8n agents through one API endpoint instead of creating separate pipelines for each workflow.

**Universal Platform Support**: Works with any application that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, including OpenWebUI, Microsoft Teams, Zoho Cliq, and Slack.

**Simple Workflow Management**: Add new workflows by tagging them with `aimodel` . No code changes needed.

**Streaming Support**: Handles both standard responses and streaming for real-time agent interactions .

## How to Use

1. Download the workflow JSON file from this repository
2. Import it into your n8n instance
3. Tag your workflows with `aimodel`  to make them accessible through the API
4. Create a new OpenAI credential in n8n and change the Base URL to point to your n8n webhook endpoints . [Learn more about OpenAI Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/) 
5. Point your chat applications to your n8n webhook URL as if it were an OpenAI API endpoint

## Requirements

- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Workflows you want to expose as AI models
- Any OpenAI-compatible chat application
