# 🎯General Principles
This workflow automates the import of leads into the **Company** table of a CRM built with Airtable. 

Its originality lies in leveraging the new "**Data Table**" node (an internal table within n8n) to generate an execution report.

**📚 Why Data Tables:** This approach eliminates the need for reading/writing operations on a Google Sheet file or an external database.

________________________________________

## 🧩 It is structured on 3 main key steps:

1. Reading leads for which email address validity has been verified.
2. Creating or updating company information.
3. Generating of execution report.

This workflow enables precise tracking of marketing actions while facilitating the historical record of interactions with prospects and clients.

## Prerequisites
### Leads file:
A prior validation check on email address accuracy is required.

### Airtable:
Must contain at least a Company table with the following fields:
* Company: company name
* Business Leader: name of the executive
* Activity: business sector (notary, accountant, plumber, electrician, etc.)
* Address: main company address
* Zip Code: postal code
* City: city
* Phone Number: phone number
* Email: email address of a manager
* URL Site: company website URL
* Opt-in: company’s consent for commercial prospecting
* Campaign: reserved for future marketing campaigns

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Description
### 1️⃣ Initialization and Lead Selection
**Data Table Initialization:**
An internal n8n table is created to build the execution report.

**Lead Selection:**
The workflow selects leads from the Google Sheet file (Sheet1 tab) where the condition "Valid Email" is equal to OK.

### 2️⃣ Iterative Loop
**Company Existence Check:**
The Search Company node is configured with Always Output Data enabled.
A JavaScript code node distinguishes three possibilities:
1. Company does not exist: create a new record and increment the created records counter.

2. Company exists once: update the record and increment the updated records counter.

3. Company appears multiple times: log the issue in the Leads file under the Logs tab, requiring a data quality procedure.

### 3️⃣ Execution Report Generation
An execution report is generated and emailed, example format:
**Leads Import Report:**
* Number of records read: 2392
* Number of records created: 2345
* Number of records updated: 42

If the sum of records created and updated differs from the total records read, it indicates **the presence of duplicates**. A counter for duplicated companies could be added.
