  "description": "![Jotform WF.png](fileId:1064)\n\n**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n**How It Works:**  \n\nJotform Webinar Registry Integration: This workflow streamlines the process of handling webinar registrations submitted via JotForm. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates with KlickTipp.  \nData Transformation: Input data is validated and transformed to meet KlickTipp’s API requirements, including formatting phone numbers, converting dates, and validating URLs.  \n\n**Key Features**  \n\n**JotForm Trigger:**  \n- Captures new form submissions, including participant details and webinar preferences.  \n\n**Data Processing:**  \n- Standardizes and validates input fields  \n- Converts phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  \n- Transforms dates into UNIX timestamps.  \n- Validates LinkedIn URLs and applies fallback URLs if validation fails.  \n- Scales numerical fields, such as work experience, for specific use cases.  \n\n**Subscriber Management in KlickTipp:**  \n- Adds or updates participants as subscribers in KlickTipp.  \n- Includes custom field mappings, such as:  \n\t- Personal information (name, email, phone number).  \n\t- Webinar details (chosen webinar, start date/time).  \n\t- Preferences (reminder intervals, questions for presenters).\n- Tags contacts for segmentation: Adds fixed and dynamic tags to contacts.\n  \n\n**Error Handling:**  \n- Validates critical fields like phone numbers, URLs, and dates to prevent incorrect data submissions.  \n\n**Setup Instructions**  \n\n**Install and Configure Nodes:**  \n- Set up the JotForm and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.  \n- Authenticate your JotForm and KlickTipp accounts.  \n\n**Custom Field Preparation in KlickTipp:**  \nCreate the necessary custom fields to match the data structure:  \n\n| **Field Name**                          | **Field Type**   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Jotform \\| URL Linkedin                 | URL              |\n| Jotform \\| Workexperience in Years      | Decimal Number   |\n| Jotform \\| Webinar start timestamp      | Date & Time      |\n| Jotform \\| Questions/Notes              | Text             |\n| Jotform \\| Webinar                      | Text             |\n| Jotform \\| Reminder                     | Text             |\n\n\nAfter creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don’t appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  \n\n**Field Mapping and Adjustments:**  \nVerify and customize field assignments in the workflow to align with your specific form and subscriber list setup.  \n\n**Workflow Logic**  \n\n1. **Trigger via JotForm Submission:** A new form submission from JotForm initiates the workflow  \n2. **Data Transformation:** Processes raw form data to ensure compatibility with KlickTipp’s API.  \n3. **Add to KlickTipp Subscriber List:** Adds participants to the designated KlickTipp list, including webinar-specific details.  \n4. **Get all tags from KlickTipp and create a list:**\nFetches all existing Tags and turns them into an array\n\n5. **Define tags to dynamically set for contacts:** Definiton of variables that are received from the form submission and should be converted into tags\n\n6. **Merge tags of both lists:** Checks whether the list of existing tags in KlickTipp contains the tags which should be dynamically set based on the form submission\n\n7. **Tag creation and tagging contacts:** Creates new tags if it previously did not exist and then tags the contact\n\n\n\n**Benefits**  \n\n**Efficient lead generation:** Contacts from forms are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  \n**Automated processes:** Experts can start workflows directly, such as welcome emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  \n**Error-free data management:** The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  \n\n**Testing and Deployment:**  \n\nTest the workflow by filling the form on Jotform and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  \n\n**Notes:**  \n\n**Customization:** Update field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup. This ensures accurate data syncing.  \n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Jotform KlickTipp Knowledge Base help article](https://www.klicktipp.com/de/support/wissensdatenbank/daten-jotform-uebertragen/)\n- [Use KlickTipp Community Node in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/install-klicktipp-node-n8n/)\n- [Automate Workflows: KlickTipp Integration in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/klicktipp-integration-n8n/)",
