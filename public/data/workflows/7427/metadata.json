  "description": "## Who’s it for\nBusy homemakers, creators, and anyone who wants a simple, no-cost way to plan weekly meals and get a ready-to-shop grocery list—without extra apps.\n\n## What it does\nRuns on a weekly Cron schedule, generates a grocery list, creates rows in your Notion database (Ingredient, Quantity, Status), and emails the list (optional Telegram confirmation). It includes a Notion connection check, detailed error notifications (email and optional Telegram), a success email with timestamp, and optional persistent logging to a Notion “Logs” database.\n\n## Requirements\n- Notion account + integration connected to your database  \n- SMTP credentials for the Email node  \n- (Optional) Telegram bot and chat ID for alerts  \n- (Optional) Notion log database if you want persistent logs\n\n## How to set up\n1. Import the workflow and open **Set: Configuration** to fill:\n   - `fromEmail`, `emailTo`, `notifyEmail`, `notionDb`, `telegramChatId`  \n   - (Optional) `logToNotion` (true/false), `notionLogDb`\n2. In Notion, create a DB with properties:\n   - **Ingredient** (Title), **Quantity** (Rich text), **Status** (Select: “To Buy”)\n3. Attach your **Notion** and **SMTP** credentials (and Telegram if used).\n4. Run once to test, then set Cron to your preferred weekly time.\n\n## How to customize\n- Edit the recipe/grocery items in the Code node.\n- Change the Cron schedule (test with “Every minute,” then revert to weekly).\n- Enable Telegram alerts, and/or turn on Notion logging for audit trails.\n",
