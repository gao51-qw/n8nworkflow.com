  "description": "## Title\n\n**Prioritize Todoist tasks and send a daily summary to Slack**\n\n## Who’s it for\n\nBusy professionals, team leads, and freelancers who want a plug-and-play, AI-assisted morning briefing that turns messy task lists into a clear, actionable plan.\n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nAt **08:00** every morning, the workflow pulls open tasks from **Todoist**. An **AI agent** scores and ranks them by urgency, importance, dependencies, and effort, then produces a concise plan. You receive the summary in **Slack** (Markdown). Overdue or critical items are highlighted with **warnings**.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect OAuth for **Todoist** and **Slack**.\n2. Select your posting channel in **Send to Slack**.\n3. Adjust the time in **Morning Schedule Trigger** (default **08:00**).\n4. Run once to verify the parser output and Slack preview, then set the workflow **Active**.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* n8n (cloud or self-hosted)\n* Todoist account / Slack workspace\n* LLM provider connected in the AI node (**do not** hardcode keys in HTTP nodes)\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n* Edit the prompt in **AI Task Analyzer** to tweak prioritization rules.\n* Adjust **Format AI Summary** to match your tone and structure.\n* Add filters in the Todoist node (e.g., due today).\n* (Optional) Log results to Google Sheets or a database for analytics.\n\n## Disclaimer (community node)\n\nThis template uses a community **LangChain** node for AI features and is intended for **self-hosted** n8n. Add a workflow image at the top of your submission page for a clearer preview.\n",
