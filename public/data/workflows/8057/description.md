# 📝 Auto-Generate Meeting Notes & Summaries (Zoom → Google Docs + Slack)

This workflow automatically captures Zoom meeting data when a meeting ends, generates AI-powered notes, saves them to Google Docs, and instantly posts a summary with a link in Slack.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Zoom Webhook** → Triggers on `meeting.ended` or `recording.completed`.  
2. **Normalize Data** → Extracts meeting details (topic, host, duration, transcript).  
3. **AI Notes (GPT-4)** → Summarizes transcript into key decisions, action items, and next steps.  
4. **Google Docs** → Saves formatted meeting notes + transcript archive.  
5. **Slack Post** → Shares summary + link to notes in `#team-meetings`.
