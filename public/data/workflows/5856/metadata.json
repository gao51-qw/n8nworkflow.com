  "description": "Turn any LinkedIn post into a personalized cold email opener that sounds like a human wrote it in seconds.\n\nWhether you're in sales, partnerships, or outreach, this tool reads LinkedIn posts like a human, distills the core message, and gives you a smart, conversational opener to kick off the relationship the right way.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1.) Paste the post + author info into a short form.\n\n2.) AI reads the post like a B2B sales expert would.\n\n3.) Output = personalized opener, company name, prospect’s name, and next steps.\n\n4.) Copy-paste into your cold email and hit send.\n\nThe opener isn’t generic fluff — it references real details, sounds natural, and shows you actually paid attention.\n\n**Perfect For:**\n\nSDRs and BDRs\n\nAgency outreach\n\nPartnership prospecting\n\nAny cold outreach that starts with a real conversation\n\n**Setup Steps**\n\n*Setup time: ~2-3 mins*\n\n1.) Add your OpenAI credentials (or use n8n’s built-in credits).\n\n2.) Open the form and test it with the sample post.\n\n3.) Tweak the AI prompt if you want to target a different niche or tone.\n\n(Optional) Connect to Google Sheets, a CRM, or your email tool.\n\nYou're live.",
