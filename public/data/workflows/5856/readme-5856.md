# Generate personalized cold email openers from LinkedIn posts with GPT-4o

> Turn any LinkedIn post into a personalized cold email opener that sounds like a human wrote it in seconds.

Whether you're in sales, partnerships, or outreach, this tool reads LinkedIn posts like a human, distills the core message, and gives you a smart, conversational opener to kick off the relationship the right way.

**How It Works:**

1.) Paste the post + author info into a short form.

2.) AI reads the post like a B2B sales expert would.

3.) Output = personalized opener, company name, prospect’s name, and next steps.

4.) Copy-paste into your cold email and hit send.

The opener isn’t generic fluff — it references real details, sounds natural, and shows you actually paid attention.

**Perfect For:**

SDRs and BDRs

Agency outreach

Partnership prospecting

Any cold outreach that starts with a real conversation

**Setup Steps**

*Setup time: ~2-3 mins*

1.) Add your OpenAI credentials (or use n8n’s built-in credits).

2.) Open the form and test it with the sample post.

3.) Tweak the AI prompt if you want to target a different niche or tone.

(Optional) Connect to Google Sheets, a CRM, or your email tool.

You're live.
