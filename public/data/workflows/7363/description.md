## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?

Most e-commerce chatbots are transactional; they answer one question at a time and forget your context right after. This workflow changes that. It introduces a **smart, memory-enabled shopping assistant** that remembers user preferences, past orders, and previous queries to offer **deeply personalized, natural conversations**.

---

## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?

1. Accepts real-time chat messages from users.
2. Uses **Zep Memory** to store and recall personalized context.
3. Integrates with:
   - 🛒 Product Inventory
   - 📦 Order History
   - 📜 Return Policy
4. Answers complex queries based on historical context.
5. Provides:
   - Personalized product recommendations
   - Context-aware order lookups
   - Seamless return processing
   - Policy discussions with minimal user input

## 🧠 Why Context & Memory Matter

Traditional bots:
- ❌ Forget what the user said 2 messages ago
- ❌ Ask repetitive questions (name, order ID, etc.)
- ❌ Can’t personalize beyond basic filters

With **Zep-powered memory**, your bot:
- ✅ Remembers preferences (e.g., favorite categories, past questions)
- ✅ Builds persistent context across sessions
- ✅ Gives dynamic, user-specific replies (e.g., "You ordered this last week…")
- ✅ Offers a **frictionless support experience**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 🧠 Zep Memory Setup
- Create a Zep instance and connect it via the **Zep Memory node**.
- It will automatically store user conversations and summarize facts.

### 💬 Chat Trigger
- Use the **"When chat message received"** trigger to initiate the conversation workflow.

### 🤖 AI Agent Configuration
- Connect:
  - **Chat Model** → OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5
  - **Memory** → Zep
  - **Tools**:
    - `Get_Orders` – Fetch user order history from Google Sheets
    - `Get_Inventory` – Recommend products based on stock and preferences
