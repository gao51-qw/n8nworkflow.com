# Scrape Google Maps leads and find emails with Apify and Anymailfinder

## Short Description

This workflow automates lead generation by scraping business data from Google Maps using [Apify](https://www.apify.com?fpr=g5q0f), enriching it with verified email addresses via [Anymailfinder](https://anymailfinder.com?via=alexandra), and storing the results in a NocoDB database. It's designed to prevent duplicates by checking against existing records before saving new leads.

***

## Key Features

-   **Automated Scraping**: Kicks off a Google Maps search based on your query, city, and country.
-   **Email Enrichment**: For businesses with a website, it automatically finds professional email addresses.
-   **Data Cleaning**: Cleans website URLs to extract the root domain, ignoring social media links.
-   **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks against existing entries in NocoDB using the Google `placeId` to avoid adding the same lead twice.
-   **Structured Storage**: Saves enriched lead data into a structured NocoDB database.
-   **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles and loops through all scraped results.

## Who This Workflow Is For

-   **Sales Teams** looking for a source of local business leads.
-   **Marketing Agencies** building outreach campaigns for local clients.
-   **Business Developers** prospecting for new partnerships.
-   **Freelancers** seeking clients in specific geographical areas.

## How It Works

1.  **Trigger**: The workflow starts when you submit the initial form with a business type (e.g., "plumber"), a city, a country code, and the number of results you want.
2.  **Scrape Google Maps**: It sends the query to [Apify](https://www.apify.com?fpr=g5q0f) to scrape Google Maps for matching businesses.
3.  **Process Leads**: The workflow loops through each result one by one.
4.  **Clean Data**: It extracts the main website domain from the URL provided by Google Maps.
5.  **Check for Duplicates**: It queries your NocoDB database to see if the business (`placeId`) has already been saved. If so, it skips to the next lead.
6.  **Find Emails**: If a valid website domain exists, it uses [Anymailfinder](https://anymailfinder.com?via=alexandra) to find associated email addresses.
7.  **Store Lead**: The final data, including the business name, address, phone, website, and any found emails, is saved as a new row in your NocoDB table.
