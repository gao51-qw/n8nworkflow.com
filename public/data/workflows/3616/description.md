# Who is this for?

This template is ideal for B2B founders, solopreneurs, growth marketers, SDRs, or anyone looking to scale their lead generation and enrichment with **no-code tools** to low-code tools.

Whether you're building your first lead pipeline or upgrading a manual spreadsheet, LeadAIgen automates the entire discovery → enrichment → logging process using AI and verified email data.

---

# What problem does this solve?

Lead sourcing and enrichment are time-consuming, inconsistent, and often require multiple tools or manual scraping.

This workflow solves that by chaining AI + contact discovery, validating everything, and storing clean, structured data in Google Sheets — ready for outreach or CRM sync.

---

# What this workflow does:

✅ Accepts an industry/topic prompt via chat trigger or Telegram,  
🤖 Uses OpenRouter (Perplexity) to find 15 relevant companies with domains,  
📤 Parses the results, filters duplicates based on your Google Sheet,  
📩 Enriches each domain with up to 3 real personal emails using Hunter.io,  
💡 If no emails found → Fallback AI tries to locate general email info,  
📊 Updates your Google Sheet with all valid enriched leads (status: “Enriched”),  
🔁 Runs in safe batches of 10 to protect your API limits,  
🛠️ Includes logic to clean data, validate JSON, and slice leads.

---

# Setup:

- Create Google Sheets, Hunter.io, and OpenRouter credentials in your n8n instance  
- Import the JSON workflow  
- Set your OpenRouter model (default = Perplexity Sonar Large)  
- Connect your Google Sheet (must contain a header row with `Domain`, `Status`, etc.)  
- Paste your Hunter API key into the Hunter.io node  
- (Optional) Add Telegram Bot trigger to chat with your lead generator
