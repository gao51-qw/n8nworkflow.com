This workflow automates the routine check for upgradable packages on your Ubuntu server, ensuring you stay updated with the latest software patches and security improvements. By running a daily script, it efficiently monitors any available package upgrades and promptly notifies you via email, saving you time and enhancing your server’s security.

How It Works:
- **Daily Monitoring**: The workflow is configured to execute a script daily that connects to your Ubuntu server and checks for any upgradable packages.
