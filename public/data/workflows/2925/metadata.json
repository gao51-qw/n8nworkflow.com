  "title": "Send email if server has upgradable packages",
  "description": "This workflow automates the routine check for upgradable packages on your Ubuntu server, ensuring you stay updated with the latest software patches and security improvements. By running a daily script, it efficiently monitors any available package upgrades and promptly notifies you via email, saving you time and enhancing your server’s security.\n\nHow It Works:\n- **Daily Monitoring**: The workflow is configured to execute a script daily that connects to your Ubuntu server and checks for any upgradable packages.\n- **Email Notification**: If any upgradable packages are detected during the check, the workflow triggers an alert mechanism that automatically sends you a notification email detailing the available updates.\n\nSet Up Steps:\n- **SSH Credentials**: Provide the SSH login credentials for your Ubuntu server. This will allow the workflow to securely connect and perform checks for software updates.\n- **SMTP Credentials**: Provide SMTP login details for your email account. These credentials are used to configure the email notifications system, enabling it to send alerts about the upgradable packages.\n\nBenefits:\n- **Timeliness**: Receive prompt updates on critical software upgrades to maintain the optimal performance and security of your server.\n- **Automation**: Reduces the need for manual checks, allowing you to focus on other critical tasks with peace of mind.\n- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the checking frequency or update the notification settings according to your preferences.",
