  "description": "## ✨ Try It Out!\nSync your **Linear issues to Todoist** automatically with this n8n workflow. When an issue is created, updated, or completed in Linear, a corresponding task is created, updated, or closed in Todoist.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n- Triggered by issue changes via `linearTrigger`\n- Routes based on action (`create`, `update`, `remove`)\n- Checks if a matching Todoist task already exists (via issue ID)\n- If the issue has:\n  - A **due date**\n  - And is assigned to **you** (`youremail@example.com`)  \n  ➤ Then it creates or updates the task accordingly\n- If the issue is marked **Done**, the Todoist task is closed\n- If it's deleted in Linear, the Todoist task is also removed\n- Sub-issues get enriched with their parent title for clarity\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Customization\n\n- Replace `youremail@example.com` with your **Linear email** in the `IF` nodes\n- Adjust which states are synced (e.g. “In Progress”, “Todo”...)\n- Customize the Todoist project, labels, or title formatting\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Bi-directional Sync?\n\nThis workflow is **one-way** (Linear ➜ Todoist).  \nBi-directional syncing *might* be possible but isn’t handled here—it would be a cool upgrade!\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- n8n with OAuth2 access to **Linear** and **Todoist**\n- Your **Linear email** set in the workflow for filtering\n- A target Todoist project (default: *Inbox*)\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Need Help?\n\nAsk in the [n8n Forum](https://community.n8n.io/) or join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XPKeKXeB7d).\n\nHappy Automating! 🚀\n",
