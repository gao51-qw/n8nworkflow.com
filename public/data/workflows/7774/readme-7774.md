  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: document.getElementById('name').value,

    source: 'website'
  })
});

## Troubleshooting
### **Common Issues and Solutions**
**Emails going to spam folder:**
 - Configure SPF and DKIM records for your sending domain
 - Use Gmail's "Send as" feature to authenticate your sending address

**Mailchimp API errors:**
 - Check your API key permissions and rate limits
 - Verify the list ID is correct (found in Audience settings)
 - Ensure required fields are properly mapped
 - Review Mailchimp's compliance requirements for your region

**Webhook not triggering:**
 - Test the webhook URL directly using tools like Postman
 - Check that your form sends POST requests with proper Content-Type headers
 - Verify JSON payload structure matches expected format
 - Review n8n execution logs for error details

**Personalization not working:**
 - Confirm form field names match the n8n node references
 - Check that data is properly passed between workflow nodes
 - Test with sample data to isolate mapping issues
 - Use n8n's data inspection tools to debug payload structure

## Performance Optimization
**High-volume handling:**
 - Consider using Mailchimp's batch operations for multiple signups
 - Implement queue systems for processing during traffic spikes
 - Monitor workflow execution times and optimize slow nodes
 - Set up error notifications to catch issues quickly
