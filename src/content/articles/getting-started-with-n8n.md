# Getting Started with n8n

n8n is a powerful extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps.

## Why n8n?

- **Self-hostable**: Keep your data on your own servers.
- **Extensible**: Add your own nodes or use the HTTP Request node to connect to any API.
- **Visual Workflow**: Design your automations with a drag-and-drop interface.

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are the building blocks of your workflow. Each node performs a specific task, like fetching data from an API or sending an email.

### Connections
Connections define the flow of data between nodes.

### Triggers
Triggers start your workflow. They can be scheduled, event-based (webhooks), or manual.
