All configurations are grouped in a single node for quick setup.\n\n* **Connect your accounts:** Authenticate the `Google Drive` and `n8n API` nodes with your credentials.\n* **Configure main settings:** Open the `Set` node named **\"CONFIG - Set your variables here\"** and:\n    * Paste the ID of your main Google Drive folder where backups will be stored.\n    * Adjust the number of recent backups you want to keep.\n* **Activate workflow:** Turn on the workflow. Your automated backup system is now active.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, including how to find your Google Drive folder ID, please refer to the sticky notes inside the workflow.",
