  "description": "Ticketing Backend automates registration, QR-ticket generation, email delivery, and check-in validation using Google Sheets, Gmail, and a webhook scanner — reducing manual ticket prep from ~3 hours to under 5 minutes for 200 attendees.\n\n![Screenshot 20251005 at 15.01.48.png](fileId:2765)\n\n## Why Use This Workflow?\n\n- **Time Savings:** Automates ticket generation & delivery. reduces manual processing for 200 attendees from ~3 hours to &lt;5 minutes.\n- **Cost Reduction:** Removes dependency on paid ticketing platforms for basic events — save up to $150–$300/month for small organizations.\n- **Error Prevention:** Single-source truth in Google Sheets with QR-based check-in reduces double-checkin and human errors by &gt;90%.\n- **Scalability:** Runs on a schedule and webhooks; scales from dozens to thousands of tickets (watch API/email quotas).\n\n\n\n## Ideal For\n\n- **Event Organizers / Community Managers:** Sell & distribute tickets for meetups, runs, and local events with immediate QR delivery.\n- **Operations / Venue Staff:** Fast, reliable check-in via mobile scanner POSTing to webhook for instant validation.\n- **Small Agencies & SaaS Teams:** Lightweight, low-cost ticketing backend that integrates with existing Google accounts.\n\n\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger (Registration):** `POST /v1/register` receives registration payload (nama, email, no_hp, jumlah_tiket, total_price, payment_method).\n2. **Data Collection (Registration):** Validate input → check existing participant in Register sheet → append registration.\n3. **Processing (Ticket Generation):** Scheduled job (START runs every minute) finds rows with Payment Status = PAID and Email Sent = NO.\n4. **Intelligence Layer:** For each ticket: generate unique Ticket ID (TL-YYYYMMDD-XXXX-N-HASH), build QR payload JSON, create QR image via qrserver API, and build HTML email with embedded base64 QR.\n5. **Output & Delivery:** Send ticket email(s) via Gmail; write one Tickets row per generated ticket and mark Email Sent = YES in Register.\n6. **Storage & Logging:** All participant & ticket records persisted to Google Sheets; check-in events update row (Checked In = YES and Checkin TIme).\n\n### Core Endpoints\n\n- Registration webhook: `POST /v1/register`\n- Scanner webhook (check-in): `POST /v1/scanner`\n\n### Event Metadata\n\n- **Event:** TABRAK_LARI\n- **Event date:** 15 November 2025\n- **Event location:** GOR Pontianak\n\n\n\n## Setup Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n| Requirement | Type | Purpose |\n|-------------|------|---------|\n| [n8n instance]([https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)) | Essential | Host the workflow and webhooks |\n| Google account (Sheets + Gmail) | Essential | Store tickets & send emails |\n| Google Sheet | Essential | Register & Tickets data store |\n| Public webhook URL / reverse proxy | Essential | Expose /v1/register & /v1/scanner to scanners/clients |\n| qrserver.com (public API) | Optional | Generate QR images (no credentials) |\n\n&gt; **Important:** Make sure your n8n instance URL is publicly accessible or use a tunneling/reverse proxy so webhooks can receive POSTs.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. Import the JSON into your [n8n instance([https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)).\n2. **Configure credentials:**\n   - **Google Sheets OAuth2:** Grant access to Google Drive & Sheets API (spreadsheets.readonly & spreadsheets).\n   - **Gmail OAuth2:** Grant send email scope (Gmail send).\n3. **Update environment-specific values:**\n   - Verify Google Sheet ID.\n   - Set the public base URL for ticket scanner clients to POST /v1/scanner.\n4. **Customize settings:**\n   - Event name/date/location (variables in Generate Ticket Data / Build HTML Email).\n   - Email sender address and subject line in Gmail node.\n5. **Test execution:**\n   - Use a sample POST to `/v1/register` with valid fields to create a registration.\n   - Mark a row as PAID and Email Sent = NO to trigger scheduled ticket generation.\n   - Simulate a scanner POST to `/v1/scanner` with the barcode JSON payload to test check-in.\n\n\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Core Nodes\n\n| Node | Purpose | Key Configuration |\n|------|---------|-------------------|\n| REGISTER (Webhook) | Accepts registration POSTs | Path: `/v1/register` |\n| Validate Input (Code) | Server-side validation | Validates nama, email, no_hp, jumlah_tiket, payment_method |\n| Get Participant (Google Sheets) | Check duplicate email | Filters Register tab by Email |\n| Store Data (Google Sheets) | Append registration | Tab: Register (gid=0) |\n| START (Schedule Trigger) | Finds paid registrations | Runs every 1 minute |\n| Get Rows (Google Sheets) | Reads Register rows | Reads full Register tab |\n| Filter Paid Not Sent (Filter) | Finds rows with Payment Status=PAID & Email Sent=NO | Filter node conditions |\n| Generate Ticket Data (Code) | Generate ticket IDs & QR payloads | Ticket ID format TL-YYYYMMDD-XXXX-N-HASH |\n| Generate QR Code (HTTP Request) | Calls qrserver.com to build PNG | URL: https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=... |\n| Build HTML Email (Code) | Builds ticket HTML & embeds Base64 QR | Template contains ticket details & QR |\n| Send Email (Gmail) | Sends ticket email | To: recipient Email; Subject configurable |\n| Update Sheet (Tickets) | Append ticket rows | Tab: Tickets (gid=2010454173) |\n| Parse Data (Code) | Aggregates ticket IDs per email | Updates Register with combined ticket IDs |\n| SCAN TICKET (Webhook) | Check-in endpoint | Path: `/v1/scanner` |\n| Parse Barcode (Code) | Parses incoming scanner payload | Expects JSON in body.barcode |\n| Get Tickets (Google Sheets) | Lookup ticket by Ticket ID | Filters Tickets tab by Ticket ID |\n| Ticket Available?

A scheduled job picks up PAID rows where Email Sent = NO; for each row it generates one record per ticket, calls the QR API for an image, sends an email per ticket (multi-ticket support), then appends Tickets rows and marks Email Sent = YES by updating the Register sheet with combined ticket IDs.\n- **Check-in:** The scanner webhook accepts barcode JSON, extracts ticket_id, looks up the Tickets sheet, prevents duplicate check-ins by checking \"Checked In\" flag, and updates sheet with check-in timestamp on success.\n\n## Customization Options\n\n### Basic Adjustments\n\n- **Email Template:** Edit Build HTML Email node to change branding, copy, or layout.\n- **Ticket ID Format:** Change code in Generate Ticket Data to alter prefix or hash length.\n- **Event Metadata:** Change event_name, event_date, event_location in code nodes.\n\n### Advanced Enhancements\n\n- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with payment gateway (e.g., webhook from Stripe) to automatically set Payment Status = PAID — complexity: medium.\n- **Cloud Storage for QR Images:** Use cloud storage (S3) for QR images instead of base64-embedding — complexity: medium-high.\n- **Batch Email Provider:** Use batch email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun) for high-volume events to reduce Gmail quota risks — complexity: medium.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Problem | Cause | Solution |\n|---------|-------|----------|\n| Invalid QR / scanner returns \"Invalid QR code format\" | Scanner payload not sending barcode JSON or malformed JSON | Ensure scanner POST body contains valid JSON string under body.barcode; validate payload in Parse Barcode node |\n| Ticket exists but cannot update | Google Sheets API auth / permission error | Reconnect Google Sheets OAuth2 credential; ensure the service account/user has edit access to the sheet |\n| Emails not sent | Gmail OAuth2 credential missing or Gmail API quota reached | Reauthorize Gmail credential; consider switching to SendGrid/Mailgun for large volumes |\n| Duplicate check-in allowed | Logic checking \"Checked In\" value mismatch (case/format) | Normalize the Checked In field values and use strict comparisons in Ticket Available? node |\n| Slow generation for many tickets | Sequential QR calls and sends | Use parallel execution or a dedicated email service; increase worker resources for n8n instance |\n\n---\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n### Scenario 1: Community Fun Run (200 attendees)\n\n- **Challenge:** Manual QR generation and emailing takes ~3 hours.\n- **Solution:** After marking registrations as PAID, the scheduled job generates 200 QR tickets and emails them automatically.\n- **Result:** Ticket prep completed in &lt;5 minutes; volunteer time reduced by ~3 hours.\n\n### Scenario 2: Regional Festival (2,000 tickets)\n\n- **Challenge:** High volume requires reliable delivery and check-in speed.\n- **Solution:** Use this workflow but replace Gmail with a transactional email provider (SendGrid) and host n8n on a scalable instance.
