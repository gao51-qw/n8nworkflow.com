Workflow receives transactions via webhook, configures processing parameters, runs OpenAI GPT-4 fraud analysis, calculates risk scores, branches on risk level, holds high-risk transactions, alerts fraud teams, logs incidents, and documents evidence for compliance investigations.\n\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. Configure webhook endpoint for transaction ingestion. \n2. Set OpenAI API key and fraud detection prompts. \n3. Connect Google Sheets for incident logging. \n4. Enable email alerts to fraud team distribution list. \n5.
