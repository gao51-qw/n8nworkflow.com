  "description": "# Edit an existing image with OpenAI ImageGen1 via API Request\n\nTransform your creative pipeline by letting **n8n** call **OpenAI ImageGen1’s _edit image_ endpoint**, automatically replacing or augmenting parts of any image you supply and returning a brand-new version in seconds. Designers, marketers, and product teams can eliminate repetitive manual edits and test more variations, faster.\n\n### Who is this for?\n- Content creators who need quick, on-brand image tweaks  \n- Marketers running A/B visual tests at scale  \n- Developers exploring the new ImageGen1 API inside low-code automations  \n\n### Use case / problem solved\nOpening design software to mask, fill, or swap objects is slow and error-prone. This workflow feeds an input image plus a prompt to **OpenAI ImageGen1**, receives the edited output, and passes it on to any service you like—perfect for bulk-editing product shots, social visuals, or UI mocks.\n\n### What this workflow does\n1. **Read or receive** the source image (Webhook → Binary Data).  \n2. **Call OpenAI ImageGen1** with an **HTTP Request** node, sending the image and edit prompt.  \n3. **Parse** the JSON response to capture the returned image URL.  \n4. **Download & hand off** the edited file (e.g., upload to S3, post to Slack, or store in Drive).\n\n### Setup\n1. Add your **OpenAI API key** in the API KEY node.  \n2. Follow the notes on the workflow for more information. \n3. (Optional) Point the final node to your preferred storage or chat tool.  \n\n&gt; 📝 A sticky note in the workflow summarizes these steps and links to the OpenAI documentation.\n\n### How to customize this workflow\n- **Trigger alternatives**: Replace the Chat with Google Drive, Airtable, etc.  \n- **Chained edits**: Loop the output back for successive prompts.  \n- **Conditional flows**: Add an If node to branch actions by image size or category.  \n\nWith renamed nodes, color-coded sticky notes, and a concise setup guide, you’ll be editing images via **OpenAI ImageGen1** in under five minutes—no code, maximum creativity.\n",
