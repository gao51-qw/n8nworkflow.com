  "description": "## Try It Out!\n\n### This n8n template creates a fully automated Instagram content schedule using AI and Google Sheets. It is perfect for content creators, marketing teams, or local businesses looking to organize and scale their social media posting.\n\n### How it works\nThe workflow starts by reading two sets of inputs from a Google Sheet:\n- Your content strategy inputs (Pillar, Objective, Frequency, Format, Structure, Examples).\n- A list of scraped blog posts with title, URL, and description (fetched from your website).\n- Blog posts are scraped using Apify and parsed to extract key fields, which are stored in a tab labeled \"Input (blog month)\".\n- You can assign a preferred posting month for each blog (e.g. fall blog posts get tagged for September).\n- The workflow then merges both inputs and extracts the relevant information for further information added by ChatGPT.\n\n### AI Scheduling & Personalization\nOnce merged, the workflow loops through each content item and:\n- Identifies if the scheduled post falls on or near a holiday (like Mother’s Day) and adjusts the content accordingly.\n- A reference tool is attached to guide structure and tone, based on a library of post examples.\n- Sends the content to an AI Agent (using GPT-4, but customizable) that generates:\n1. A compelling Instagram caption\n2. A visual description\n3. Hashtags\n4. Suggested post date, day, content pillar, and format (carousel, reel, image, etc.)\n\n### Output\n- All generated content including captions, structure, dates, hashtags, and pillar is exported into a tab titled Output in your Google Sheet.\n- The final schedule is ready for manual review, editing, or publishing to social media.\n\n### How to use\n- The workflow uses a manual trigger to start, but you can replace it with a Webhook, cron job, or form submission.\n- Add/edit your content strategy in Google Sheets.\n\n### How to Set-Up\n### Initial Input Tab\n- Define your content pillars and structure\n- Create a tab named \"Input\" or \"Strategy\" \nInclude these columns:\n- Pillar: e.g., Family images\n- Objective: e.g., Showcase images\n- Frequency: e.g., Bi-weekly\n- Content Form: e.g., Images, Reels\n- Structure: brief description of expected layout (e.g., carousel Q&A, singular photo)\n- Examples: prompts or questions to guide AI (e.g., Why do you think families should do a session?)\n\n### Input (blog month) Tab – Store scraped blog content\nInclude these columns:\n- URL: direct link to blog post\n- Title: blog post title\n- Description: short summary of the post\n- Preferred Month: month you want it posted (e.g., August, September)\n- This sheet is partially auto-filled by the workflow (except for Preferred Month)\n\n### Output Tab – Final scheduled content\nInclude these columns:\n- Date: scheduled posting date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Day: day of the week\n- Pillar: content category assigned\n- Format: e.g., Images, Reels, Carousel\n- Description: visual summary\n- Caption: Instagram-ready caption\n- Hashtags: complete hashtag block\n\n### To use the Apify HTTP Request node:\n1. Drag in an HTTP Request node into your n8n workflow.\n2. Set the Method and URL based on how you're using Apify:\n- Use POST if you want to run an actor live with dynamic input (e.g. scrape blog posts in real time).\n- Use GET if you want to retrieve results from a completed or static dataset run (faster and cheaper if you're reusing previous data).\n3. Configure query or body parameters:\n4. Include your Apify API token for authentication (e.g. token=YOUR_API_KEY)\n- For POST: include an input object with any required actor settings (e.g., blog URL to scrape).\n- For GET: specify the dataset ID in the URL \n5. Test the node to ensure you're retrieving the blog titles, descriptions, and URLs as expected.\n\n### Requirements\n- Apify account for scraping blog posts\n- OpenAI key (e.g. GPT-4) or another model of your choice\n- Google Sheets Credentials \n\n### Example Use Cases\n- A photographer repurposing blogs into Instagram carousels\n- A nonprofit automatically generating seasonal posts \n- A small team managing multi-pillar content across weeks or months\n\n### Need Help?\nJoin the n8n Discord or ask in the n8n Forum!\nHappy Content Making ! 📅✨\n",
