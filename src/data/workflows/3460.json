  "description": "# 🎨 AI Graphic Design Team - Generate and Review AI Images with Ideogram and OpenAI\n![image](https://fillin8n.realsimple.dev/ideoGener8r_Team.png)\n## Description\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is perfect for graphic designers, creative agencies, marketing teams, or freelancers who regularly use AI-generated images in their projects. It's specifically beneficial for teams that want to automate the generation, review, and management of AI-created graphics efficiently.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\nDesign teams often face time-consuming manual reviews and inconsistent quality checks for AI-generated images. This workflow addresses these challenges by automating image generation and introducing a systematic, AI-driven vetting process. This ensures only high-quality, relevant images reach your team's assets, saving valuable time and enhancing workflow efficiency.\n\n### What this workflow does\n- **AI Image Generation:** Integrates Ideogram via HTTP Request to automatically create AI-generated images based on creative briefs.\n- **Automated Image Review:** Uses OpenAI to automatically evaluate and approve images, ensuring they meet your predefined quality standards.\n- **Efficient Asset Management:** Automatically creates structured Google Drive folders and compiles key metadata (including creation dates, prompts, and image links) into a CSV file and Google Sheet.\n- **Immediate Email Notifications:** Delivers a setup confirmation and provides easy access to Google Drive folders and assets via automated email notifications.\n- **Final Approved Images:** Outputs vetted, ready-to-use images for your creative projects, removing the burden of manual reviews.\n---\n![image](https://fillin8n.realsimple.dev/n8n_igraphic_design_team_screen_cap.png)\n## Setup\n---\n\n1. **Initial Email Configuration**\n   - Update your email details in both the \"Setup Gmail\" node and the \"Gmail\" notification node.\n   - Run the initial setup workflow to automatically create the Google Drive folders \"Graphic_Design_Team\" and \"Image_Generations,\" and upload your CSV file (`n8n-Graphic_Design_Team.csv`).\n\n2. **Review Email & Set Up Google Sheets**\n   - Check your inbox for an automated email containing folder IDs and direct links.\n   - Create and set up a Google Sheet by importing the provided CSV data from your email.\n\n3. **Update Workflow Nodes**\n   - Select your newly created Google Sheet in both Google Sheets nodes.\n   - Update your Creative Brief node with the Google Drive folder IDs provided in the email.\n\n4. **Run Workflow for AI Image Generation & Review**\n   - Execute the workflow. Your generated images will be automatically vetted, organized, and ready for creative use.\n\n## How to Customize This Workflow\n- **Tailor Image Generation Prompts:** Adjust prompts and settings in the Ideogram HTTP Request node to better fit your project's creative requirements.\n- **Set Quality Standards:** Modify the criteria used by the OpenAI node to reflect your specific standards and preferences for image approval.\n- **Customize Asset Organization:** Adapt Google Drive folder structures, CSV headers, or Google Sheets integrations to match your team's organizational preferences.\n\n## Dependencies & Requirements\n- **Nodes Used:**\n  - HTTP Request (Ideogram API integration)\n  - OpenAI (Image review and quality assessment)\n  - Gmail (Automated notifications)\n  - Google Drive (File and asset management)\n  - Google Sheets (Metadata organization)\n\n- **Credentials:**\n  Ensure Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, and OpenAI credentials are properly configured in your n8n account. No custom or community nodes are needed.\n\n## Final Outcome\nUpon completion, your workflow efficiently provides vetted, high-quality AI-generated images, organized in Google Drive and accessible via easy-to-use metadata in Google Sheets, drastically reducing manual intervention and accelerating your creative processes.\n\n",
