  "description": "**Track NFT market trends, collections, and trades in real time—directly from Telegram!** This master workflow integrates the **OpenSea API**, **GPT-4o-mini AI**, and **Telegram**, allowing users to request natural-language NFT analytics and receive structured insights instantly.\n\nWhether you're an NFT trader, collector, or market analyst, this Telegram-native assistant brings you **on-demand market intelligence—powered by OpenSea and AI.**\n\n&gt; ⚠️ **Important:** This workflow **requires three sub-workflows** to function properly. These must be downloaded and published in your n8n instance.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Required Sub-Workflows  \nTo activate this template, download and publish the following workflows:\n\n1. **[Analyze NFT Market Trends with AI-Powered OpenSea Analytics Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3237-analyze-nft-market-trends-with-ai-powered-opensea-analytics-agent-tool)**  \n2. **[Get Real-time NFT Insights with OpenSea AI-Powered NFT Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3238-get-real-time-nft-insights-with-opensea-ai-powered-nft-agent-tool)**  \n3. **[Get Real-time NFT Marketplace Insights with OpenSea Marketplace Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3239-get-real-time-nft-marketplace-insights-with-opensea-marketplace-agent-tool)**  \n\n📌 You can also find these by visiting my Creator profile:  \n👉 **[https://n8n.io/creators/don-the-gem-dealer/](https://n8n.io/creators/don-the-gem-dealer/)**\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**  \n1. A **Telegram bot** receives a message (e.g., “Top sales for Azuki”).  \n2. The AI router in this workflow determines which agent should process the request:  \n   - **Marketplace Agent** → Listings, offers, and orders  \n   - **Analytics Agent** → Sales volume, price trends, wallet behavior  \n   - **NFT Agent** → Metadata, traits, ownership info  \n3. The selected agent queries the **OpenSea API** using your API key.  \n4. The response is processed using **GPT-4o-mini**, formatted, and sent back via Telegram.\n\n---\n\n## **What You Can Do with This Agent**  \n🔹 **Discover undervalued NFTs** based on trait rarity and price  \n🔹 **Track market trends** for any collection in real time  \n🔹 **Compare collection performance** by volume, sales, and listings  \n🔹 **Analyze flipping trends and whale activity** across wallets  \n🔹 **Retrieve NFT ownership and metadata** instantly  \n🔹 **View trait-specific offers** for insight into rarity-driven demand  \n\n---\n\n## **Example Queries You Can Use**  \n✅ _\"What are the cheapest NFTs in the Pudgy Penguins collection?\"_  \n✅ _\"Get sales volume for Azuki and CloneX over the last 30 days.\"_  \n✅ _\"Who owns Bored Ape #456?\"_  \n✅ _\"Show the best current offers for Moonbirds.\"_  \n\n---\n\n## **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Create a Telegram Bot**  \n   - Use [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create your bot and get the API token.  \n2. **Get an OpenSea API Key**  \n   - Apply for your API key via the [OpenSea Developer Portal](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-keys).  \n3. **Configure n8n Credentials**  \n   - Add your **Telegram Bot** and **OpenSea API Key** under *Credentials* in n8n.  \n4. **Download Required Sub-Workflows**  \n   - Install and publish the following workflows:  \n     - [Analytics Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3237-analyze-nft-market-trends-with-ai-powered-opensea-analytics-agent-tool)  \n     - [NFT Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3238-get-real-time-nft-insights-with-opensea-ai-powered-nft-agent-tool)  \n     - [Marketplace Agent Tool](https://n8n.io/workflows/3239-get-real-time-nft-marketplace-insights-with-opensea-marketplace-agent-tool)  \n5. **Deploy & Test**  \n   - Chat with your Telegram bot. Try: _\"Compare BAYC and Azuki volume\"_ or _\"Show listings for Doodles.\"_\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Notes  \n&gt; If your queries don’t respond correctly, make sure all three sub-workflows are installed and **published**, not just saved.\n\n---\n\n🚀 **Dominate the NFT market with AI-powered OpenSea intelligence—right from your Telegram inbox!**\n",
