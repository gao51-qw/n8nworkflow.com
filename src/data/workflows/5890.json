  "title": "Automate restaurant marketing & booking with Excel, VAPI voice agent & calendar",
  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates how to create a comprehensive marketing automation and booking system that combines Excel-based lead management with voice-powered customer interactions. The system utilizes VAPI for voice communication and Excel/Google Sheets for data management, making it ideal for restaurants seeking to automate marketing campaigns and streamline booking processes through intelligent voice AI technology.\n\n## Good to know\n\n- Voice processing requires active VAPI subscription with per-minute billing\n- Excel operations are handled in real-time with immediate data synchronization\n- The system can handle multiple simultaneous voice calls and lead processing\n- All customer data is stored securely in Excel with proper formatting and validation\n- Marketing campaigns can be scheduled and automated based on lead data\n\n## How it works\n\n### Lead Management & Marketing Automation Workflow\n1. **New Lead Trigger**: Excel triggers capture new leads when customers are added to the lead management spreadsheet\n2. **Lead Preparation**: The system processes and formats lead data, extracting relevant details (name, phone, preferences, booking history)\n3. **Campaign Loop**: Automated loop processes through multiple leads for batch marketing campaigns\n4. **Voice Marketing Call**: VAPI initiates personalized voice calls to leads with tailored restaurant offers and booking invitations\n5. **Response Tracking**: All call results and lead responses are logged back to Excel for campaign analysis\n\n### Booking & Order Processing Workflow\n1. **Voice Response Capture**: VAPI webhook triggers when customers respond to marketing calls or make direct booking requests\n2. **Response Storage**: Customer responses and booking preferences are immediately saved to Excel sheets\n3. **Information Extraction**: System processes natural language responses to extract booking details (party size, preferred times, special requests)\n4. **Calendar Integration**: Booking information is automatically scheduled in restaurant management systems\n5. **Confirmation Loop**: Automated follow-up voice messages confirm bookings and provide additional restaurant information\n\n## Excel Sheet Structure\n\n### Lead Management Sheet\n| Column | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **lead_id** | Unique identifier for each lead |\n|
