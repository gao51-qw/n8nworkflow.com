  "description": "## Overview  \nThis workflow converts a single topic into a full blog article through a structured multi-step process. Instead of generating everything in one pass, it breaks the task into clear stages to produce cleaner structure, better SEO consistency, and more predictable output quality.\n\n## How this workflow differs from asking ChatGPT directly  \n- It does not produce an article in one step.  \n- It separates the process into two focused stages: outline generation and paragraph expansion.  \n- This approach gives you more control over tone, SEO, structure, and keyword placement.\n\n## How it works  \n### 1. Generate outline  \n- The workflow sends your topic to an AI Agent.  \n- It returns a structured outline based on the topic, desired depth, language, and keyword focus.\n\n### 2. Expand each subtopic  \n- The workflow loops through each outline item.  \n- Every subtopic is expanded into a detailed, SEO-friendly paragraph.  \n- Output is consistent and optimized for readability.\n\n### 3. Produce final outputs  \n- Combines all expanded sections into:  \n  - A clean JSON object  \n  - A Markdown version ready for blogs or CMS  \n- The JSON includes:  \n  - Title  \n  - HTML content  \n  - Markdown content  \n- You can send this directly to REST APIs such as WordPress, Notion, or documentation platforms.  \n- Content is validated for readability and typically scores well in tools like Yoast SEO.  \n- Uses GPT-4o Mini by default, with average token usage between 2000 and 3000 depending on outline size.\n\n## Use cases  \n- Auto-generate long-form articles for blogs or content marketing.  \n- Turn Instagram or short-form scripts into complete SEO articles.  \n- Create documentation or educational content using consistent templates.  \n\n## Setup steps  \n### 1. Prepare credentials  \n- Add your OpenAI API Key inside n8n’s credential manager.\n\n### 2. Adjust input parameters  \n- Topic or main idea  \n- Number of outline items  \n- Language  \n- Primary keyword  \n- Tone or writing style (optional)\n\n### 3. Customize the workflow  \n- Switch the model if you want higher quality or lower token usage.  \n- Modify the prompt for the outline or paragraph generator to match your writing style.  \n- Add additional nodes if you want to auto-upload the final article to WordPress, Notion, or any API.\n\n### 4. Run the workflow  \n- Enter your topic  \n- Execute the workflow  \n- Retrieve both JSON and Markdown outputs for immediate publishing\n\nIf you need help expanding this into a full content pipeline or want to integrate it with other automation systems, feel free to customize further.\n",
