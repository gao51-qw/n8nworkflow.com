This is unsustainable and takes their time away from teaching. Tailored for UK teachers but can be expanded globally with prompt and form enhancements.\n\n\n## How it works\nI built a system with three specialized AI agents that create complete lesson packages and automatically uploads a document in Google drive and puts an appointment in calendar to review the document.\n### Features\n1. Research agent to pull specific information including special education needs and curriculums.\n2. The scoring and assessment agent to generate tailored assessment plans, assignments, grading mechanism based on chosen requirements.\n3. The integration agent just provides ideas to expand to other tools. In nfuture there is opportunity to add on Kahoot or other tools to create quizzes.\n4. Finally the enriched document is emailed and a calendar invite is sent for review. \n\n## What you need\nN8N\nAny LLM API Key (I used OpenAI)\nGoogle drive integration\nGoogle calendar integration\nModify the email id from XXX@gmail.com to your Email id in email component.\n\n## Support\n\nWatch this video for intro on how it works. \n\nContact me on info@pankstr.com for any queries.\n\n\n",
