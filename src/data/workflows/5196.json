  "description": "## AI-Powered Email Draft Automation Workflow\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up an AI-driven workflow that automatically processes incoming emails using a custom AI model (e.g., Llama), prepares email content, and saves it as a Gmail draft. Ready to automate your email drafting process? Let’s dive in!\n\n### What’s the Goal?\n- Automatically detect and process new emails via IMAP.\n- Use a custom AI model to analyze and generate email content.\n- Prepare structured and relevant email responses.\n- Save the generated content as a Gmail draft for review or sending.\n- Enable 24/7 email automation with seamless integration.\n\nBy the end, you’ll have a self-running email assistant that drafts responses effortlessly.\n\n### Why Does It Matter?\nManual email drafting is time-consuming and prone to delays. Here’s why this workflow is a game changer:\n- **Zero Human Error:** AI ensures consistent and accurate drafts.\n- **Time-Saving Automation:** Instantly process and draft emails, boosting efficiency.\n- **24/7 Availability:** Handle emails anytime without manual intervention.\n- **Focus on Strategy:** Free your team from repetitive drafting tasks.\n\nThink of it as your tireless email drafting assistant that never misses a beat.\n\n### How It Works\nHere’s the step-by-step magic behind the automation:\n\n##### Step 1: Trigger the Workflow\n- Detect new emails using IMAP via the `Check New Email (IMAP)` node.\n- Capture incoming email content for processing.\n\n##### Step 2: Process Email with AI\n- Send the email text to a custom AI model (e.g., Llama) for analysis.\n- Use the `Custom AI Model` node to generate a context-aware response or draft content.\n\n##### Step 3: Prepare Email Content\n- Format the AI-generated content into a polished email structure using the `Prepare Email Content` node.\n- Ensure the content is ready for drafting with proper salutations and structure.\n\n##### Step 4: Save as Gmail Draft\n- Route the prepared email content to the `Save as Gmail Draft` node.\n- Save the draft in Gmail for review or manual sending.\n\n##### Step 5: Log & Optimize\n- Log all processed emails and drafts in a database (e.g., Airtable, Google Sheets).\n- Continuously improve the AI model based on feedback or new email patterns.\n\n### How to Use the Workflow?\nImporting a workflow in n8n is a straightforward process that allows you to use pre-built or shared workflows to save time. Below is a step-by-step guide to importing the **Smart Email Draft Generator** workflow in n8n, based on the official documentation and community resources.\n\n**Steps to Import a Workflow in n8n**\n\n**1. Obtain the Workflow JSON**\n- **Source the Workflow:**\n  - Workflows are typically shared as JSON files or code snippets. You might receive them from:\n    - The n8n community (e.g., n8n.io workflows page).\n    - A colleague or tutorial (e.g., a .json file or copied JSON code).\n    - Exported from another n8n instance.\n- **Format:** Ensure you have the workflow in JSON format, either as a file (e.g., `workflow.json`) or as text copied to your clipboard.\n\n**2. Access the n8n Workflow Editor**\n- **Log in to n8n:**\n  - Open your n8n instance (via n8n Cloud or your self-hosted instance).\n  - Navigate to the **Workflows** tab in the n8n dashboard.\n- **Open a New Workflow:**\n  - Click **Add Workflow** to create a blank workflow, or open an existing workflow if you want to merge the imported workflow.\n\n**3. Import the Workflow**\n**Option 1: Import via JSON Code (Clipboard):**\n- In the n8n editor, click the **three dots (⋯)** in the top-right corner to open the menu.\n- Select **Import from Clipboard**.\n- Paste the JSON code of the workflow into the provided text box.\n- Click **Import** to load the workflow into the editor.\n\n**Option 2: Import via JSON File:**\n- In the n8n editor, click the **three dots (⋯)** in the top-right corner.\n- Select **Import from File**.\n- Choose the `.json` file from your computer.\n- Click **Open** to import the workflow.\n\n**Setup Notes:**\n- **IMAP Credentials:** Configure IMAP settings in the `Check New Email (IMAP)` node with your email account credentials (e.g., Gmail IMAP settings).\n- **Custom AI Model:** Set up the `Custom AI Model` node with your AI model credentials (e.g., Llama API key or endpoint).\n- **Gmail Integration:** Authorize the `Save as Gmail Draft` node with Gmail API credentials to save drafts.\n- **Content Customization:** Adjust the `Prepare Email Content` node to tailor the email structure or tone as needed.",
