  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\n  \n\nThis **n8n workflow template** is designed for **customer support**, **CX**, and **ops teams** that manage customer messages through HubSpot and use Jira for internal task management. It is especially useful for SaaS companies aiming to automate ticket triage, sentiment detection, and team assignment using **AI agents**.\n\n---\n\n## **🧩 What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\n  \n\nCustomer service teams often struggle with manual message classification, delayed reactions to churn signals, and inefficiencies in routing support issues to the right internal teams. This workflow uses **LLMs** and **automated profiling** to:\n\n- Detect churn risk or intent in customer messages\n    \n- Summarize issues\n    \n- Classify tickets into categories (e.g. fulfillment, technical, invoicing)\n    \n- Automatically create **Jira tickets** based on enriched insights\n    \n\n---\n\n## **🤖 What this workflow does**\n\n  \n\nThis AI-powered workflow processes HubSpot support tickets and routes them to Jira based on sentiment and topic. Here’s the full breakdown:\n\n1. **Triggers**: Either manually or on a schedule (via cron).\n    \n2. **Fetch HubSpot tickets**: Retrieves new messages and their metadata.\n    \n3. **Run Orchestration Agent**:\n    \n    - Uses **Sentinel Agent** to detect **emotional tone**, **churn risk**, and **purchase intent**.\n        \n    - Calls **Profiler Agent** to enrich customer profiles from HubSpot.\n        \n    - Summarizes the message using OpenAI.\n        \n    - Classifies the ticket using a custom classifier (technical, fulfillment, etc.).\n        \n    \n4. **Generate a Jira ticket**:\n    \n    - Title and description are generated using GPT.\n        \n    - The assignee and project are predefined.\n        \n    \n5. **AI agents can be expanded** (e.g. add Guide or Facilitator agents).\n    \n\n---\n\n## **⚙️ Setup**\n\n  \n\nTo use this template, you’ll need:\n\n- **HubSpot account** with OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n    \n- **Jira Software Cloud account** and project ID\n    \n- **OpenAI credentials** for GPT-based nodes\n    \n- Optional: Create sub-workflows for additional AI agents\n    \n\n  \n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the workflow in your n8n instance.\n    \n2. Replace placeholder credentials for **HubSpot**, **OpenAI**, and **Jira**.\n    \n3. Adjust Jira project/issue type IDs to match your setup.\n    \n4. Test the workflow using the **manual trigger** or **scheduled trigger** node.\n    \n\n---\n\n## **🛠️ How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n  \n\n### **1. Edit category logic**\n\n  \n\nIn the **“Category Classifier”** node, modify categories and prompt structure to match your internal team structures (e.g., billing, account management, tech support).\n\n  \n\n### **2. Refine AI prompts**\n\n  \n\nCustomize the agent prompt definitions in:\n\n- Sentinel_agent\n    \n- Profiler_agent\n    \n- Orchestrator\n    \n    to better align with your brand tone or service goals.\n    \n\n  \n\n### **3. Update Jira integration**\n\n  \n\nYou can route tickets to different projects or team leads by adjusting the **“Create an issue in Jira”** node based on classification output.\n\n  \n\n### **4. Add escalation paths**\n\n\nInsert Slack, email, or webhook notifications for specific risk levels or customer segments.\n\n---\n\nThis workflow empowers your team with **real-time message triage**, **automated decision-making**, and **AI-enhanced customer insight**, turning every inbound ticket into a data-driven action item.\n\n---",
