By integrating with Apollo's APIs and Google Sheets, it streamlines lead generation, ensures data accuracy through human verification, and maintains an organized leads database.\n\n## 📚 Use Case\nIdeal for sales and marketing teams aiming to:\n- Automate the discovery of key decision-makers (e.g., CEOs, CTOs).\n- Enrich contact information with LinkedIn profiles, emails, and phone numbers.\n- Maintain an up-to-date leads database with minimal manual intervention.\n- Receive weekly summaries of newly verified leads.\n\n## 🧪 Setup\n**1.** Google Sheets Preparation:\n\n- Use the following pre-configured Google Sheet: [Company Decision Maker Discovery Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KqKFZ7Uxrt1MivBjLklGdPRMgNBhEc0slpthoSjt2wI/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n- This spreadsheet includes the necessary tabs and columns: `Companies`, `Contacts`, and `Contacts (Verified)`.\n- It also contains a custom `onEdit` Apps Script function that automatically updates the Status column to `Pending` whenever the Domain field is modified.\n- To review or modify the script, navigate to __Extensions &gt; Apps Script__ within the Google Sheet.\n\n**2.** Credentials Setup:\n\n- Configure the following credentials in your n8n instance:\n\t- Google Sheets: To read from and write to the spreadsheet.\n\t- Slack: To send verification prompts and weekly reports.\n\t- Apollo: To access the Organization Search, Organization Enrichment, People Search, and Bulk People Enrichment APIs.\n\t- LLM Service (e.g., OpenAI): To generate company summaries and determine departments based on job titles.\n\n**3.** Workflow Configuration:\n\n- Import the workflow into your n8n instance.\n- Update the nodes to reference the correct Google Sheet and Slack channel.\n- Ensure that the Apollo and LLM nodes have the appropriate API keys and configurations.\n\n**4.** Testing the Workflow:\n\n- Add a new company entry in the Companies tab of the Google Sheet.\n- Verify that the workflow triggers automatically, processes the data, and updates the Contacts and Contacts (Verified) tabs accordingly.\n- Check Slack for any verification prompts and confirm that weekly reports are sent as scheduled.",
