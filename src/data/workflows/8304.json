It requires a self-hosted n8n instance and will not run on n8n Cloud.\n\n**What this workflow does**\n\n1. **Monitors OneDrive** for new blueprints in a target folder\n2. **Downloads the file** inside n8n for processing\n3. **Sends the file to VLM Run** for VLM analysis\n4. **Fetches details** from the `construction.blueprint` domain as JSON\n5. **Appends normalized fields** to an Excel sheet as a new row\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:** Microsoft account, VLM Run API credentials, OneDrive access, Excel Online, n8n. Install the verified **VLM Run** node by searching for **VLM Run** in the node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can start using it in your workflows.\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\n1. Create the OneDrive folder you want to watch and copy its Folder ID\n\n   * OneDrive web: open the folder in your browser, then copy the value of the `id=` URL parameter. It is URL-encoded.\n   * Alternative in n8n: use a OneDrive node with the operation set to List to browse folders and copy the `id` field from the response.\n\n2. Create an Excel sheet with headers like: `timestamp, file_name, file_id, mime_type, size_bytes, uploader_email, document_type, document_number, issue_date, author_name, drawing_title_numbers, revision_history, job_name, address, drawing_number, revision, drawn_by, checked_by, scale_information, agency_name, document_title, blueprint_id, blueprint_status, blueprint_owner, blueprint_url`\n\n3. Configure OneDrive OAuth2 for the trigger and download nodes\n\n   * Use Microsoft OAuth2 in n8n. Approve requested scopes for file access and offline access when prompted.\n   * Test the connection by listing a known folder.\n\n4. Add VLM Run API credentials from [https://app.vlm.run/dashboard](https://app.vlm.run/dashboard) to the VLM Run node\n\n5. Configure Excel Online OAuth2 and set Spreadsheet ID and target sheet tab\n\n6. Test by uploading a sample file to the watched OneDrive folder and activate\n\n## Perfect for\n\n* Converting uploaded construction blueprint documents into clean text\n* Organizing extracted blueprint details into structured sheets\n* Quickly accessing key attributes from technical files\n* Centralized archive of blueprint-to-text conversions\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n* **End to end automation** from OneDrive upload to structured Excel entry\n* **Accurate text extraction** of construction blueprint documents\n* **Organized attribute mapping** for consistent records\n* **Searchable archives** directly in Excel\n* **Hands-free processing** after setup\n\n## How to customize\n\n**Extend by adding:**\n\n* Version control that links revisions of the same drawing and highlights superseded rows\n* Confidence scores per extracted field with threshold-based routing to manual or AI review\n* Auto-generate a human-readable summary column for quick scanning of blueprint details\n* Split large multi-sheet PDFs into per-drawing rows with individual attributes\n* Cross-system sync to Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud, or BIM 360 for project-wide visibility\n",
