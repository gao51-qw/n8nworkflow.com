  "description": "# Auto-Generate SEO FAQ Answers from Google Sheets with OpenAI\n\n## Intro/Overview\n\nThis workflow automates the process of generating SEO-optimized FAQ answers using AI, pulling questions from a Google Sheet and writing answers back into the same sheet. It’s ideal for content marketers, SEO specialists, and digital teams looking to scale FAQ content generation with minimal manual input.\n\nBy combining the power of Google Sheets, AI, and WordPress, the workflow transforms raw questions into structured, keyword-targeted answers tailored for specific audiences — ready for use on landing pages, blogs, or help centers, and automatically publishes them as WordPress posts.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n- **Schedule Trigger**: Executes the workflow at a set interval to check for new or unprocessed questions in the Google Sheet.\n\n- **Get Questions from Sheet**: Reads from a specific Google Sheet, targeting columns for:\n  - `Question` (FAQ prompt)\n  - `KW` (target SEO keyword)\n  - `Audience` (intended reader)\n  - `Article` (desired WordPress post title)\n\n- **Filter**: Ensures only rows without an existing answer are processed (i.e., empty \"Answer\" column).\n\n- **Generate FAQ Answer**: Passes the question, keyword, and audience to the OpenAI Chat Model using a structured prompt to generate:\n  - A concise TL;DR-style summary\n  - A detailed, SEO-optimized markdown-formatted answer\n\n- **OpenAI Chat Model**: Utilizes GPT-4 Turbo with a controlled temperature (0.7) and token limit (1000) to produce structured, on-brand, keyword-optimized content.\n\n- **Parse FAQ Answer**: Extracts and formats the AI response into separate fields for writing back to the sheet.\n\n- **Update Sheet with Answer**: Writes the AI-generated answer into the `Answer` column of the same row in the source Google Sheet.\n\n- **WordPress Node**: Publishes each generated answer as a new WordPress post  \n  - Uses “Create Post” operation  \n  - **Title:** Taken from the `Article` column in the sheet  \n  - **Content:** Uses the detailed AI-generated answer  \n  - Requires valid WordPress credentials (REST API / Application Password)\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Importing the Workflow**\n   - Download or import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n\n2. **Credential Setup**\n   - Connect your **Google Sheets** credentials.  \n   - Add your **OpenAI API Key** in the relevant node.  \n   - Connect your **WordPress** credentials for content publishing.\n\n3. **Node Assignment**\n   - Update the following:\n     - **Google Sheet ID**\n     - **Sheet range** (ensure it includes all relevant columns)\n\n4. **Timezone & Schedule**\n   - Adjust the **Schedule Trigger** node to match your preferred time and frequency (e.g., every weekday at 9 AM).\n\n5. **Testing Guidance**\n   - Add a few sample FAQ entries in your sheet.\n   - Run the workflow manually to verify:\n     - Prompt quality\n     - Answer accuracy\n     - Proper sheet update\n     - Successful WordPress post creation\n\n---\n\n## Example Use Cases\n\n- Marketing teams generating bulk FAQ content for landing pages\n- SEO professionals creating keyword-optimized responses for user queries\n- Agencies producing personalized FAQ sections for multiple client niches\n- SaaS companies automating knowledge base content with targeted messaging\n- Content teams publishing AI-generated FAQs directly to WordPress blogs\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- ✅ **Google Account** with access to the target Google Sheet  \n- ✅ **OpenAI API Key** (GPT-4 Turbo or equivalent)  \n- ✅ **WordPress account** with REST API or Application Password access  \n- ✅ Google Sheet with the following columns:\n  - `Question`: The FAQ prompt  \n  - `KW`: Target keyword for SEO  \n  - `Audience`: Intended reader persona  \n  - `Article`: Desired WordPress post title  \n  - `Answer`: Output column (leave empty initially)\n\n---\n\n## Customization (Optional Section)\n\n- **Tone & Style**: Modify the system prompt to reflect your brand voice (e.g., friendly, expert, concise).  \n- **Model**: Use a different AI model (e.g., Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI GPT-4.1).  \n- **Output Format**: Adjust the markdown output to use different heading levels, bullet styles, or HTML if required.  \n- **Audience Logic**: Expand the input options to fine-tune responses for more specific demographics or buyer personas.  \n- **Multi-output Options**: Extend the workflow to post content to Notion, CMS, or documentation platforms alongside Google Sheets and WordPress.\n\n---\n\nThis automation accelerates content creation, automatically keeps your FAQ sections SEO-friendly, and publishes the results directly to WordPress — keeping your content pipeline running hands-free once deployed.\n",
