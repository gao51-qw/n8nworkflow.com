  "description": "## Description\nAutomatically consolidate Zendesk and Freshdesk ticket data into a unified performance dashboard with KPI calculations, Google Sheets logging, real-time Slack alerts, and weekly Gmail email reports. Provides complete visibility into support operations, SLA compliance, and customer satisfaction across multiple platforms. 📊💬📧\n\n## What This Template Does\n- Runs weekly on schedule to fetch tickets from both Zendesk and Freshdesk. ⏰\n- Merges ticket data into a standardized JSON structure with normalized priorities, statuses, and channels. 🔄\n- Logs all tickets and metadata into Google Sheets for audit-ready performance tracking. 📑\n- Calculates advanced KPIs including resolution rates, SLA breaches, CSAT score estimation, urgent ticket rates, and performance grading. 📊\n- Evaluates alert conditions (e.g., high SLA breach, low CSAT, backlog risk). 🚨\n- Sends formatted Slack alerts with performance grades, key metrics, and recommendations. 💬\n- Generates corporate-style HTML weekly reports and delivers them via Gmail. 📧\n\n## Key Benefits\n- Unifies Zendesk and Freshdesk data into one consistent reporting flow. 🌐\n- Provides actionable KPIs for SLA monitoring, customer satisfaction, and backlog health. ⏱️\n- Ensures leadership visibility with Google Sheets logs and professional email reports. 🧾\n- Alerts the support team instantly on Slack when performance drops. 🚨\n- Reduces manual data analysis with automated grading and recommendations. 🤖\n\n## Features\n- Multi-Platform Ticket Integration – Fetches tickets from Zendesk and Freshdesk. 🎫\n- Data Normalization – Cleans descriptions, maps priorities/statuses, and detects escalations. 🧼\n- Google Sheets Logging – Tracks tickets with IDs, URLs, tags, timestamps, and metadata. 📈\n- KPI Calculation Engine – Computes SLA breach rate, resolution rate, CSAT, escalation %, and more. 🧮\n- Performance Grading – Grades support performance (A–D) with detailed descriptions. 🏅\n- Slack Alerts – Notifies with active alerts, recommendations, and emoji-based health signals. 📢\n- Weekly Gmail Reports – Delivers branded HTML reports for management and audits. ✨\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).\n- Zendesk API credentials with ticket read access.\n- Freshdesk API credentials with ticket read access.\n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials with spreadsheet write permissions.\n- Slack Bot API credentials with posting permissions.\n- Gmail OAuth2 credentials with send email permissions.\n- Pre-configured Google Sheet for KPI logging.\n\n## Target Audience\n- Support managers overseeing multi-platform ticketing systems. 👩‍💻\n- Customer success teams monitoring SLA compliance and CSAT health. 🚀\n- SMBs running Zendesk + Freshdesk who need unified dashboards. 🏢\n- Remote/global support teams needing automated KPI visibility. 🌐\n- Executives requiring weekly performance reports and recommendations. 📈\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n- Connect Zendesk, Freshdesk, Google Sheets, Slack, and Gmail credentials in n8n. 🔑\n- Update the Google Sheet ID in the “Log KPIs in Google Sheets” node. 📊\n- Configure Slack channel ID for alerts (default: zendesk-churn-alerts). 💬\n- Replace {Enter Your Email} in the Gmail node with your recipient email. 📧\n- Adjust thresholds in the KPI calculation node (default: 4h response, 24h resolution). ⏱️\n- Test with sample tickets to validate Sheets logging, Slack alerts, and Gmail reports. ✅\n- Deploy on schedule (default: weekly at 8 PM) for continuous tracking. 🗓️\n",
