  "description": "LinkedIn Hiring Signal Scraper — Jobs & Prospecting Using Bright Data\n\n## Purpose:\nDiscover recent job posts from LinkedIn using Bright Data's Dataset API, clean the results, and log them into Google Sheets — for both job hunting **and** identifying high-intent B2B leads based on hiring activity.\n\n## Use Cases:\n- **Job Seekers** – Spot relevant openings filtered by role, city, and country.  \n- **Sales & Prospecting** – Use job posts as buying signals.  \n  If a company is hiring for a role you support (e.g. marketers, developers, ops) —  \n  it's the perfect time to reach out and offer your services.\n\n## Tools Needed:\n- **n8n Nodes:**\n  - Form Trigger  \n  - HTTP Request  \n  - Wait  \n  - If  \n  - Code  \n  - Google Sheets  \n  - Sticky Notes (for embedded guidance)\n- **External Services:**\n  - [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com) (Dataset API)  \n  - [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jbr5zBllTy_pGbogfGSvyv1_0a77I8tU-Ai7BjTAw4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## API Keys & Authentication Required:\n- **Bright Data API Key**  \n  → Add in the HTTP Request headers:  \n  `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`\n\n- **Google Sheets OAuth2**  \n  → Connect your account in n8n to allow read/write access to the spreadsheet.\n\n## General Guidelines:\n- Use descriptive names for all nodes.  \n- Include retry logic in polling to avoid infinite loops.  \n- Flatten nested fields (like `job_poster` and `base_salary`).  \n- Strip out HTML tags from job descriptions for clean output.\n\n## Things to be Aware Of:\n- Bright Data snapshots take ~1–3 minutes — use a Wait node and polling.  \n- Form filters affect output significantly:  \n  🔍 We recommend filtering by **\"Last 7 days\"** or **\"Past 24 hours\"** for fresher data.  \n- Avoid hardcoding values in the form — leave optional filters empty if unsure.\n\n## Post-Processing & Outreach:\n- After data lands in Google Sheets, you can use it to:  \n  - Personalize cold emails based on job titles, locations, and hiring signals.  \n  - Send thoughtful LinkedIn messages (e.g., \"Saw you're hiring a CMO...\")  \n  - Prioritize outreach to companies actively growing in your niche.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n- 📄 Copy the Google Sheet Template:  \n  [Click here to make your copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jbr5zBllTy_pGbogfGSvyv1_0a77I8tU-Ai7BjTAw4/edit?usp=sharing)  \n  → Rename for each campaign or client.\n\n- Form fields include:  \n  - Job Location (city or region)  \n  - Keyword (e.g., CMO, Backend Developer)  \n  - Country (2-letter code, e.g., US, UK)\n\n---\n\nThis workflow gives you a competitive edge —  \n📌 For candidates: Be first to apply.  \n📌 For sellers: Be first to pitch.  \nAll based on live hiring signals from LinkedIn.\n\n---\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH\n\n### Step 1: Set up your Google Sheet\n1. Open this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jbr5zBllTy_pGbogfGSvyv1_0a77I8tU-Ai7BjTAw4/edit?usp=sharing)\n2. Go to `File → Make a copy`\n3. You'll use this copy as the destination for the scraped job posts\n\n### Step 2: Fill out the Input Form in n8n\nThe form allows you to define what kind of job posts you want to scrape.\n\n**Fields:**\n- **Job Location** → e.g. `New York`, `Berlin`, `Remote`  \n- **Keyword** → e.g. `CMO`, `AI Architect`, `Ecommerce Manager`  \n- **Country Code (2-letter)** → e.g. `US`, `UK`, `IL`\n\n**💡 Pro Tip:**  \nFor best results, set the filter inside the workflow to:  \n`time_range = \"Past 24 hours\"` or `\"Last 7 days\"`  \nThis keeps results relevant and fresh.\n\n### Step 3: Trigger Bright Data Snapshot\nThe workflow sends a request to Bright Data with your input.\n\nExample API Call Body:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"location\": \"New York\",\n    \"keyword\": \"Marketing Manager\",\n    \"country\": \"US\",\n    \"time_range\": \"Past 24 hours\",\n    \"job_type\": \"Part-time\",\n    \"experience_level\": \"\",\n    \"remote\": \"\",\n    \"company\": \"\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nBright Data will start preparing the dataset in the background.\n\n### Step 4: Wait for the Snapshot to Complete\nThe workflow includes a Wait Node and Polling Loop that checks every few minutes until the data is ready.\n\nYou don't need to do anything here — it's all automated.\n\n### Step 5: Clean Up the Results\nOnce Bright Data responds with the full job post list:\n\n✔️ Nested fields like job_poster and base_salary are flattened  \n✔️ HTML in job descriptions is removed  \n✔️ Final data is formatted for export\n\n### Step 6: Export to Google Sheets\nThe final cleaned list is added to your Google Sheet (first tab).\n\nEach row = one job post, with columns like:\n\njob_title, company_name, location, salary_min, apply_link, job_description_plain\n\n### Step 7: Use the Data for Outreach or Research\n#### Example for Job Seekers:\nYou search for:\n\n- Location: Berlin\n- Keyword: Product Designer\n- Country: DE\n- Time range: Past 7 days\n\nNow you've got a live list of roles — with salary, recruiter info, and apply links.\n→ Use it to apply faster than others.\n\n#### Example for Prospecting (Sales / SDR):\nYou search for:\n\n- Location: London\n- Keyword: Growth Marketing\n- Country: UK\n\nAnd find companies hiring growth marketers.\n→ That's your signal to offer help with media buying, SEO, CRO, or your relevant service.\n\nUse the data to:\n- Write personalized cold emails (\"Saw you're hiring a Growth Marketer…\")\n- Start warm LinkedIn outreach\n- Build lead lists of companies actively expanding in your niche\n\n## API Credentials Required:\n- **Bright Data API Key**  \n  Used in HTTP headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`\n\n- **Google Sheets OAuth2**  \n  Allows n8n to read/write to your spreadsheet\n\n## Adjustments & Customization Tips:\n- Modify the HTTP Request body to add more filters (e.g. job_type, remote, company)\n- Increase or reduce polling wait time depending on Bright Data speed\n- Add scoring logic to prioritize listings based on title or location\n\n## Final Notes:\n- 📄 Google Sheet Template:  \n  [Make your copy here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jbr5zBllTy_pGbogfGSvyv1_0a77I8tU-Ai7BjTAw4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- ⚙️ Bright Data Dataset API:  \n  Visit [BrightData.com](https://get.brightdata.com/1tndi4600b25)\n\n- 📬 Personalization works best when you act quickly.  \n  Use the freshest data to reach out with context — not generic pitches.\n\n---\n\nThis workflow turns LinkedIn job posts into sales insights and job leads.\nAll in one click. Fully automated. Ready for your next move.",
