  "description": "### About The Product Hunt Automation\n\nStaying up-to-date with specific topics and launches on Product Hunt can be time-consuming. Manually checking the site multiple times a day interrupts your workflow and risks missing important launches. What if you could automatically get relevant launches delivered to your Slack workspace?\n\n### How to Monitor Product Hunt\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn how to create a Product Hunt monitoring system using Airtop's built-in node in n8n. This automation will scan Product Hunt for your chosen topics and deliver the most relevant launches directly to Slack.\n\n\n### What You'll Need\n\n- A free [Airtop API key](https://portal.airtop.ai/?utm_campaign=n8n)\n- A Slack workspace with permissions to add incoming webhooks\n- Estimated setup time: 5 minutes\n\n### Understanding the Process\n\nThe Monitor Product Hunt automation uses Airtop's cloud browser capabilities to access Product Hunt and extract launch information. Here's what happens:\n\n- Airtop visits Product Hunt and navigates the page\n- It searches for and extracts up to 5 launches related to your chosen topic\n- The information is formatted and sent to your specified Slack channel\n\nThis process can run on your preferred schedule, ensuring you never miss relevant launches.\n\n![image.png](fileId:1101)\n\n\n### Setting Up Your Automation\n\nWe've created a ready-to-use template that handles all the complex parts. Here's how to get started:\n\n- Connect your Airtop account by adding the API key you created\n- Connect your Slack account\n- Set your prompt in the Airtop node. For this example, we’ve set it to be _“Extract up to 5 launches related to AI products”_\n- Choose your preferred monitoring schedule.\n\n### Customization Options\n\nWhile our template works immediately, you might want to customize it for your specific needs:\n\n- Adjust the prompt and the maximum number of launches to monitor\n- Customize the Slack message format\n- Change the monitoring frequency\n- Add filters for particular keywords or companies\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nHere's how teams can use this automation:\n\n- A **startup's engineering team** could track trends in other product’s tech stack, helping them stay informed about potential issues and improvements.\n\n- A **product manager** can track launches of competitor products, enabling them to gather valuable market insights and user feedback directly from the tech community on that launch.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo get the most out of this automation:\n\n- **Choose Specific Search Terms**: For more relevant results, instead of broad terms like \"AI,\" use specific phrases like \"machine learning for healthcare\"\n- **Optimize Scheduling**: When setting the monitoring frequency, consider your team's workflow. Running the scenario every 4 hours during working hours often provides a good balance between staying updated and avoiding notification fatigue.\n- **Set Up Error Handling**: Enable n8n's error output to alert you if the automation encounters any issues with accessing Product Hunt or sending messages to Slack.\n- **Regular Topic Review**: Schedule a monthly review of your monitored topics to ensure they're still relevant to your needs and adjust as necessary.\n\n\n### What's Next?\n\nNow that you've set up your Product Hunt monitor automation, you might be interested in:\n\n- Creating a similar monitor for other tech websites\n- Setting up automated content curation for your team's newsletter\n- Building a competitive intelligence dashboard using web monitoring\n\nHappy Automating!",
