  "description": "# Landing Page Lead Intake via Webhook to Zoho CRM, Jira Task & Slack Alerts\n\nThis n8n workflow captures lead data from a landing-page webhook, validates required fields and then processes the lead by creating a Zoho CRM Lead, generating a Jira Task and notifying a Slack channel. If required fields are missing, the workflow skips CRM + Jira creation and instead notifies Slack with available lead details.\n\n### ⚡ Quick Start: 5-Step Fast Implementation\n\n1. Import this workflow JSON into n8n.  \n2. Configure credentials: Zoho CRM OAuth2, Jira Cloud, Slack OAuth2.  \n3. Copy the webhook URL and connect it to your landing page form.  \n4. Ensure your form sends: first_name, last_name, company_name, email, phone, title, description, referrer.  \n5. Activate workflow → send test POST → verify Zoho, Jira & Slack outputs.\n\n\n## What It Does\nThis workflow works as an automated lead pipeline. When the landing page sends JSON to the webhook, the workflow checks if `last_name` and `company_name` are present. If both fields exist, it proceeds to create a Zoho CRM lead, then generates a Jira task using the same data. A detailed Slack message is then posted with all lead information and the newly created Jira task ID.\n\nIf any of the required fields are missing, the workflow does not create CRM or Jira entries. Instead, it sends a Slack notification with available details so teams can intervene manually without incorrect CRM data entry.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n- Marketing teams capturing leads from landing pages.\n- Sales teams using CRM and Jira for task tracking.\n- Internal teams who want Slack alerts for new leads.\n- Agencies and startups handling inbound lead flow.\n- Anyone requiring automated lead routing without manual work.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n- n8n instance  \n- Zoho CRM OAuth2 credential  \n- Jira Software Cloud credential  \n- Slack OAuth2 credential  \n- A landing page that sends POST JSON payloads  \n- Required payload fields:  \n  - first_name  \n  - last_name  \n  - company_name  \n  - email  \n  - phone  \n  - title  \n  - description  \n  - referrer  \n\n\n## How to Use & Setup\n\n### Step 1: Import Workflow\nGo to n8n → Workflows → Import workflow JSON.\n\n### Step 2: Configure Credentials\nAdd your credentials in:\n- Zoho CRM (Create a lead)\n- Jira Software Cloud (Create an issue)\n- Slack (Send a message & Send a message1)\n\n### Step 3: Connect Webhook\nCopy the Webhook URL from the **Webhook** node and configure your landing page to send POST JSON to it.\n\n### Step 4: Field Validation\nThe **If** node checks:\n- last_name exists  \n- company_name exists  \n\nIf both exist → CRM + Jira + Slack  \nIf missing → Slack-only alert\n\n### Step 5: Test Workflow\nSend sample JSON using your landing page or Postman.  \n\nCheck Zoho CRM, Jira task creation, and Slack messages.\n\n### Step 6: Activate Workflow\nEnable workflow after verification.\n\n\n## How To Customize Nodes?\n\n### Webhook Node\n- Add/remove expected fields  \n- Modify payload structure  \n\n### If Node\n- Add more validations  \n- Switch to OR logic  \n\n### Zoho CRM Lead Node\n- Add additional fields  \n- Modify CRM field mapping  \n\n### Jira Task Node\n- Change project, issue type, priority, assignee  \n- Modify description template  \n\n### Slack Nodes\n- Change channel  \n- Rewrite notification messages  \n- Add Slack formatting  \n\n\n## Add-ons (Optional Enhancements)\n- Email notification to lead  \n- Google Sheets entry logging  \n- Duplicate lead detection  \n- Lead scoring system  \n- CRM sync extensions (Contact, Account, etc.)  \n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n1.
