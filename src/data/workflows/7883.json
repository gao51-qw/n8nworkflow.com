  "description": "This workflow automates the creation of realistic **Multi-speaker podcasts** using **ElevenLabsv3 API** by reading a script from Google Sheets and saving the final MP3 file to Google Drive.\n\n1. **Data Source** – Dialogue scripts are stored in a **Google Sheet**. Each row contains:\n\n   * Speaker name (optional)\n   * Voice ID (from ElevenLabs)\n   * Text to be spoken\n\n2. **Data Preparation** – The workflow transforms the spreadsheet content into the proper JSON format required by the ElevenLabs API.\n\n3. **Podcast Generation** – ElevenLabs’ **Eleven v3 model** converts the prepared text into expressive, natural-sounding dialogue. It supports not only speech but also **non-verbal cues and audio effects** (e.g., *\\[laughs], \\[whispers], \\[clapping]*).\n\n4. **File Storage** – The generated audio file is automatically **uploaded to Google Drive**, organized by timestamped filenames.\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n* **Seamless Automation** – From dialogue writing to final audio upload, everything runs automatically in one workflow.\n* **Multi-Speaker Support** – Easily assign different voices to multiple characters for dynamic conversations.\n* **Expressive & Realistic Output** – Supports emotions, speech styles, and ambient effects, making podcasts more immersive.\n* **Flexible Content Input** – Scripts can be collaboratively written and edited in Google Sheets, with no technical knowledge required.\n* **Scalable & Reusable** – Can generate multiple podcast episodes in seconds, ideal for content creators, educators, or businesses.\n* **Cloud Integration** – Final audio files are securely stored in Google Drive, ready to be shared or published.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\nThe workflow processes a structured script from a spreadsheet and uses AI to generate a realistic conversation.\n\n1.  **Manual Trigger:** The workflow is started manually by a user clicking \"Execute workflow\" in n8n.\n2.  **Get Dialogue:** The \"Get dialogue\" node fetches the podcast script data from a specified Google Sheet. The sheet should contain columns for Speaker (optional), Voice ID, and the dialogue Input/Text.\n3.  **Prepare Dialogue:** The \"Code\" node transforms the raw sheet data into the precise JSON format required by the ElevenLabs API. It creates an array of objects where each object contains the `text` and the corresponding `voice_id` for each line of dialogue.\n4.  **Generate Podcast:** The \"HTTP Request\" node sends a `POST` request to the ElevenLabs Text-to-Dialogue API endpoint (`/v1/text-to-dialogue`). It sends the transformed dialogue array in the request body, instructing the API to generate a single audio file with a conversation between the specified voices.\n5.  **Upload File:** The \"Upload file\" node takes the audio file response from ElevenLabs and saves it to a designated folder in Google Drive..\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo use this workflow, you must complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**\n    *   **Clone the Template:** Duplicate the [provided Google Sheet template](https://docs.goo# Header 1gle.com/spreadsheets/d/1eB8iUQmhj3xJMpGam_slCS0ivtgTUpbcWAqeutG_HM8/edit?usp=sharing) into your own Google Drive.\n    *   **Fill the Script:**\n        *   **Column A (Speaker):** Optional. Add speaker names for your reference (e.g., \"Host\", \"Guest\").\n        *   **Column B (Voice ID):** **Mandatory.** Enter the unique Voice ID for each line from ElevenLabs.\n        *   **Column C (Input):** **Mandatory.** Write the dialogue text for each speaker. You can use [non-speech audio events] like `[laughs]` or `[whispers]` to add expression.\n\n2.  **Configure ElevenLabs API Credentials:**\n    * Login or create FREE account on [Elevenlabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu)\n\t*   Edit the \"Generate podcast\" node's credentials.\n    *   Create an `HTTP Header Auth` credential named \"ElevenLabs API\".\n    *   Set the **Name** to `xi-api-key` and the **Value** to your actual ElevenLabs API key.\n\n3.  **Configure Google Services:**\n    *   **Google Sheets:** Ensure the \"Get dialogue\" node has valid OAuth credentials and that the `documentId` points to **your copy** of the script sheet.\n    *   **Google Drive:** Ensure the \"Upload file\" node has valid OAuth credentials and that the `folderId` points to the correct Google Drive folder where you want the audio files saved.\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
