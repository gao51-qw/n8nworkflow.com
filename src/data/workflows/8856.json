  "description": "**This template enriches a lead list by analyzing each contact’s company website and auto-generating a single personalized cold-email opener. Drop a spreadsheet into a Google Drive folder → the workflow parses rows, fetches website content via Jina AI, uses OpenAI to check if the site contains valid business info, then calls Anthropic to craft a one-liner.
