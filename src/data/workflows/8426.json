  "description": "## How It Works\nThis workflow automatically classifies incoming Gmail messages into categories such as **High Priority**, **Inquiry**, and **Finance/Billing**, and then generates professional draft replies using **GPT-4**. By combining Gmail integration with AI-powered text generation, the workflow helps business owners and freelancers reduce the time spent managing emails while ensuring that important messages are handled quickly and consistently.\n\nWhen a new email arrives, the workflow:\n1. Triggers via Gmail.\n2. Uses an AI classifier to categorize the message.\n3. Applies the appropriate Gmail label.\n4. Passes the email body to GPT-4 to generate a tailored draft reply.\n5. Saves the draft in Gmail, ready for review and sending.\n\n## Requirements\n- A Gmail account with API access enabled.  \n- An OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access.  \n- n8n account or self-hosted instance.  \n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.  \n2. Under **Credentials**, connect your Gmail account and OpenAI API key.  \n3. Replace placeholder `YOUR_LABEL_ID_XXX` values with your Gmail label IDs (obtainable via Gmail → List Labels).  \n4. Execute the workflow and check that draft replies are generated in your Gmail account.  \n\n## Customization\n- Add or edit categories to fit your business needs (e.g., “Sales Leads” or “Support”).  \n- Adjust the GPT-4 prompts inside each “Generate Draft” node to match your preferred tone and style.  \n- Combine with other workflows (e.g., CRM integration, Slack alerts) for a complete email automation system.  \n\nThis template is especially useful for **small businesses and freelancers** who want to save time, improve response speed, and maintain professional communication without manually writing every reply.\n",
