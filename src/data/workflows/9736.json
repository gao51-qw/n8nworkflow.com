  "description": "## Automated Support Prioritization and AI Task Creation\n\nThis n8n workflow instantly captures support issues submitted via **Jotform** and efficiently **routes** them to the appropriate team and logging system based on the **severity level** defined by the customer. It then uses an **AI Agent (Google Gemini)** to transform the raw customer data into a clear, concise, and actionable task for the development team.\n\n### Workflow Overview\n\n1.  **Ingestion & Logging:** A new support ticket is received via **Jotform** and immediately logged into a **Google Sheet** as a central record.\n2.  **Priority Assessment & Routing:** An **If** node checks the reported issue **Severity**.\n    * **High/Medium Severity:** The ticket details are instantly sent to a dedicated **Slack** channel for immediate team attention.\n    * **Low Severity:** The ticket details are sent via **Gmail** (acting as an internal email notification) to a support inbox, allowing for less immediate handling.\n3.  **AI Processing:** An **AI Agent** summarizes the raw feedback into a clear, professional task description.\n4.  **Task Creation:** The AI-generated task is automatically created in **ClickUp** for the development team to manage.\n\n***\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo implement and run this automated support workflow, the following accounts and credentials are required:\n\n### 1. Service Credentials\n\n* **Jotform API Key:** For the **Jotform Trigger** to receive real-time form submissions.\n* **Google Sheets OAuth2/API Key:** To write data to the designated sheet.\n* **Slack OAuth2/API Key:** To post messages to the target Slack channel.\n* **Gmail OAuth2/API Key:** To send internal email notifications.\n* **Google Gemini API Key:** To power the **AI Agent** for task summarization.\n* **ClickUp API Key:** To create tasks in the target workspace.\n**Sign up for n8n using:** [https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/pe6gzwqi3rqw](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/pe6gzwqi3rqw)\n\n### 2. External Configurations\n\n* **Jotform Setup:** A form configured with fields for Name, Email, Issue, Description, and the crucial **Severity** field.\n**Sign up for Jotform using:** [https://www.jotform.com/?partner=zainurrehman](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=zainurrehman)\n* **ClickUp Setup:** The specific **Team, Space, Folder, and List IDs** must be configured in the **Create a task** node to ensure tickets are created in the correct project board.",
