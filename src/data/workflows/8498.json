  "description": "## Overview\nOrganizations struggle to make their document repositories searchable and accessible. Users waste time searching through lengthy PDFs, manuals, and documentation to find specific answers. This workflow creates a powerful API service that instantly answers questions about any document or image, perfect for building customer support chatbots, internal knowledge bases, or interactive documentation systems.\n\n## What You Can Do\nThis workflow creates a RESTful webhook API that accepts questions about documents and returns intelligent, contextual answers. It processes various document formats including PDFs, Word documents, text files, and images using OCR when needed. The system maintains conversation context through session management, caches responses for performance, provides source references with page numbers, handles multiple concurrent requests, and integrates seamlessly with chatbots, support systems, or custom applications.\n\n## Who It's For\nPerfect for developer teams building conversational interfaces, customer support departments creating self-service solutions, technical writers making documentation interactive, organizations with extensive knowledge bases, and SaaS companies wanting to add document Q&A features. Ideal for anyone who needs to make large document repositories instantly searchable through natural language queries.\n\n## The Problem It Solves\nTraditional document search returns entire pages or sections, forcing users to read through irrelevant content to find answers. Support teams repeatedly answer the same questions that are already documented. This template creates an intelligent Q&A system that provides precise, contextual answers to specific questions, reducing support tickets by up to 60% and improving user satisfaction.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Install the PDF Vector community node from n8n marketplace\n2. Configure your PDF Vector API key\n3. Set up the webhook URL for your API endpoint\n4. Configure Redis or database for session management\n5. Set response caching parameters\n6. Test the API with sample documents and questions\n\n## Key Features\n- **RESTful API Interface**: Easy integration with any application\n- **Multi-Format Support**: Handle PDFs, Word docs, text files, and images\n- **OCR Processing**: Extract text from scanned documents and screenshots\n- **Contextual Answers**: Provide relevant responses with source citations\n- **Session Management**: Enable conversational follow-up questions\n- **Response Caching**: Improve performance for frequently asked questions\n- **Analytics Tracking**: Monitor usage patterns and popular queries\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for unsupported documents\n\n## API Usage Example\n```bash\nPOST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/doc-qa\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"documentUrl\": \"https://example.com/user-manual.pdf\",\n  \"question\": \"How do I reset my password?\",\n  \"sessionId\": \"user-123\",\n  \"includePageNumbers\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Customization Options\nAdd authentication and rate limiting for production use, implement multi-document search across entire repositories, create specialized prompts for technical documentation or legal documents, add automatic language detection and translation, build conversation history tracking for better context, integrate with Zendesk, Intercom, or other support systems, and enable direct file upload support for local documents.\n\n**Note:** This workflow uses the PDF Vector community node. Make sure to install it from the n8n community nodes collection before using this template.",
