It’s especially useful for generating documents like contracts, invoices, or reports quickly and efficiently without manual intervention.\n\n## What does this workflow do?\nThe workflow receives data from a form in n8n.\nIt uses the form data to replace the corresponding variables (e.g., {{example_variable}}) in a Google Docs template.\nThe document is then generated with the new values, ready for further use, such as sending or archiving.\n\n## How to set up this workflow?\n1. Prepare the template: Create a Google Docs template with variables in the {{variable}} format that you want to replace with form data.\n2. Modify the variables in the n8n form: Make sure the form fields correspond to the variables you want to replace in the Google Docs template.\n3. Connect to Google Docs: Set up the connection to Google Docs in n8n using the appropriate authentication credentials.\n4. Test the workflow: Run the workflow to ensure that the form data correctly replaces the variables in the Google Docs template.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs?\nChange the data source: You can modify the form or other data sources (e.g., API) from which the replacement values will be fetched.\nCustomize the Google Docs template: Adapt the template to include additional fields for replacement as needed.\nIntegrate with other applications: You can expand the workflow to include actions like sending the generated document via email, saving it to Google Drive, or passing it to other systems.\n\n",
