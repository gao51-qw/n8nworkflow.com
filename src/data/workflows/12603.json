  "description": "This workflow automates the **end-to-end analysis of WooCommerce product reviews**, transforming raw customer feedback into **actionable product and customer-care insights**, and delivering them in a structured, visual, and shareable format.\n\nThis workflow analyzes product review sentiment from WooCommerce using AI. It starts by retrieving reviews for a specified product via the WooCommerce. \n\nEach review then undergoes sentiment analysis using LangChain's Sentiment Analysis. The workflow aggregates sentiment data, creates a pie chart visualization via QuickChart, and compiles a comprehensive report using an AI Agent. \n\nThe report includes executive summaries, quantitative data, qualitative analysis, product diagnostics, and operational recommendations. Finally, the **AI-generated report** is converted to HTML and emailed to a designated recipient for review by customer and product teams.\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n#### 1. ✅  Full Automation of Review Analysis\n\nEliminates manual work by automating data collection, sentiment analysis, reporting, visualization, and delivery in a single workflow.\n\n#### 2. ✅ Scalable and Reliable\n\nBatch processing ensures the workflow can handle **dozens or hundreds of reviews** without performance issues.\n\n#### 3. ✅ Action-Oriented Insights (Not Just Sentiment)\n\nInstead of stopping at sentiment scores, the workflow produces:\n\n* Root-cause hypotheses\n* Concrete improvement actions\n* Prioritized recommendations (P0 / P1 / P2)\n* Measurable KPIs\n\n#### 4. ✅ Combines Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis\n\nMerges hard metrics (averages, distributions, outliers) with qualitative insights (themes, risks, opportunities), giving a **360° view of customer feedback**.\n\n#### 5. ✅ Visual + Narrative Output\n\nStakeholders receive both:\n\n* **Visual sentiment charts** for quick understanding\n* **Structured written reports** for strategic decision-making\n\n#### 6. ✅ Ready for Product & Customer Care Teams\n\nThe output format is tailored for non-technical teams:\n\n* Clear language\n* Masked personal data (GDPR-friendly)\n* Immediate usability in meetings, emails, or documentation\n\n#### 7. ✅ Easily Extensible\n\nThe workflow can be extended to:\n\n* Run on a schedule\n* Analyze multiple products\n* Store results in a database or CRM\n* Trigger alerts for negative sentiment spikes\n\n\n#### Ideal Use Cases\n\n* Continuous monitoring of product sentiment\n* Supporting product roadmap decisions\n* Identifying customer pain points early\n* Improving customer support response strategies\n* Reporting customer voice to stakeholders automatically\n\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **Manual Trigger & Configuration**\n   The workflow starts manually and sets the target **WooCommerce product ID** and **store URL**.\n\n2. **Data Retrieval from WooCommerce**\n\n   * Fetches **all reviews** for the selected product via the WooCommerce REST API.\n   * Retrieves **product details** (name, description, categories) to enrich the analysis context.\n\n3. **Batch Processing of Reviews**\n   Reviews are processed in batches to ensure scalability and reliability, even with a large number of reviews.\n\n4. **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis**\n\n   * Each review is analyzed using an OpenAI-based sentiment analysis model.\n   * For every review, the workflow extracts:\n\n     * Sentiment category (Positive / Negative / Neutral)\n     * Strength (intensity)\n     * Confidence (reliability of the classification)\n\n5. **Data Normalization & Aggregation**\n\n   * Review text is cleaned and structured.\n   * Sentiment data is aggregated to compute overall distributions and metrics.\n\n6. **Visual Sentiment Distribution**\n\n   * A pie chart is dynamically generated via QuickChart to visually represent sentiment distribution.\n\n7. **Advanced AI Insight Generation**\n   A specialized AI agent (“Product Insights Analyst”) transforms the raw and aggregated data into a **professional, structured report**, including:\n\n   * Executive summary\n   * Quantitative statistics\n   * Qualitative themes\n   * Product diagnosis\n   * Operational recommendations\n   * Product backlog ideas\n   * Next steps\n\n8. **HTML Conversion & Delivery**\n\n   * The report is converted into clean HTML.\n   * The final output is automatically sent via **email** to stakeholders (e.g. product or customer care teams).\n\n---\n\n### Set up steps\n1. **Configure credentials**:\n   - Set up WooCommerce API credentials in the HTTP Request node.\n   - Add OpenAI API credentials for both sentiment analysis and reporting.\n   - Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials for sending the final email report.\n\n2. **Set parameters**:\n   - In the \"Product ID\" node, replace `PRODUCT_ID` and `YOUR_WEBSITE` with actual product ID and WooCommerce site URL.\n   - Update the recipient email address in the \"Send a message\" node.\n\n3. **Optional adjustments**:\n   - Modify the pie chart design in the \"QuichChart\" node if needed.\n   - Adjust the report structure or language in the \"Product Insights Analyst\" system prompt.\n\n4. **Run the workflow**:\n   - Click \"Execute workflow\" on the manual trigger to start the process.\n   - Monitor execution in n8n to ensure all nodes process correctly.\n\nOnce configured, the workflow will automatically analyze product reviews, generate insights, and deliver a formatted report via email.\n\n---\n\n👉 [Subscribe to my new **YouTube channel**](https://youtube.com/@n3witalia).
