  "description": "### **Real-Time ClickUp Time Tracking to HubSpot Project Sync**\n\nThis workflow automates the synchronization of time tracked on ClickUp tasks directly to a custom project object in HubSpot, ensuring your project metrics are always accurate and up-to-date.\n\n---\n\n### **Use Case & Problem**\n\nThis workflow is designed for teams that use a **custom object in HubSpot** for high-level project overviews (tracking scoped vs. actual hours per sprint) but manage daily tasks and time logging in **ClickUp**. The primary challenge is the constant, manual effort required to transfer tracked hours from ClickUp to HubSpot, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. This automation eliminates that manual work entirely.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n* **Triggers on Time Entry:** The workflow instantly starts whenever a user updates the time tracked on any task in a specified ClickUp space. ⏱️\n* **Fetches Task & Time Details:** It immediately retrieves all relevant data about the task (like its name and custom fields) and the specific time entry that was just updated.\n* **Identifies the Project & Sprint:** The workflow processes the task data to determine which HubSpot project it belongs to and categorizes the work into the correct sprint (e.g., Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Additional Requests).\n* **Updates HubSpot in Real-Time:** It finds the corresponding project record in HubSpot and updates the master `actual_hours_tracked` property. It then intelligently updates the specific field for the corresponding sprint (e.g., `actual_sprint_1_hours`), ensuring your reporting remains granular and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Requirements**\n\n✅ **ClickUp Account** with the following custom fields on your tasks:\n* A **Dropdown** custom field named `Sprint` to categorize tasks.\n* A **Short Text** custom field named `HubSpot Deal ID` or similar to link to the HubSpot record.\n\n✅ **HubSpot Account** with:\n* A **Custom Object** used for project tracking.\n* **Custom Properties** on that object to store total and sprint-specific hours (e.g., `actual_hours_tracked`, `actual_sprint_1_hours`, `total_time_remaining`, etc.).\n\n&gt; **Note:** Since this workflow interacts with a **custom HubSpot object**, it uses flexible HTTP Request nodes instead of the standard n8n HubSpot nodes.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n1.  **Configure Credentials:** Add your ClickUp (OAuth2) and HubSpot (Header Auth with a Private App Token) credentials to the respective nodes in the workflow.\n2.  **Set ClickUp Trigger:** In the **`Time Tracked Update Trigger`** node, select your ClickUp team and the specific space you want to monitor for time updates.\n3.  **Update HubSpot Object ID:** Find the ID of your custom project object in HubSpot. In the HubSpot HTTP Request nodes (e.g., `OnProjectFolder`), replace the placeholder ID `objectTypeId` in the URL with your own objectTypeId\n\n---\n\n### **How to Customize**\n\n* Adjust the **`Code: Extract Sprint & Task Data`** node to change how sprint names are mapped or how time is calculated.\n* Update the URLs in the HubSpot HTTP Request nodes if your custom object or property names differ.",
