  "description": "# AI-powered Meeting Summaries and Action Items to Slack and ClickUp\n\n## How it Works  \n1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow starts when Fireflies notifies that a transcription has finished.  \n2. **Transcript Retrieval**: The transcript is pulled from Fireflies based on the meeting ID.  \n3. **Pre-processing**: The transcript is split into sentences and then aggregated into a raw text block.  \n4. **AI Summarization**: The aggregated transcript is sent to Google Gemini, which generates a short summary and a structured list of action items.  \n5. **Post-processing**: The AI response is cleaned and formatted into JSON. Action items are mapped to titles and descriptions.  \n6. **Distribution**:  \n   - The meeting summary is posted to Slack.  \n   - Action items are created as tasks in ClickUp.  \n\n---\n\n## Use Case  \nThis workflow is designed for teams that want to reduce the manual effort of writing meeting notes and extracting action items.  \n\n- Automatically generate a clear and concise meeting summary  \n- Share the summary instantly with your team on Slack  \n- Ensure action items are not lost by automatically creating tasks in ClickUp  \n- Ideal for distributed teams, project managers, and product teams managing recurring meetings  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements  \n- **n8n instance** set up and running  \n- **Fireflies.ai account** with API access to meeting transcripts  \n- **Google Gemini API (via PaLM credentials)** for AI-powered summarization  \n- **Slack account** with OAuth2 credentials connected in n8n  \n- **ClickUp account** with OAuth2 credentials connected in n8n",
