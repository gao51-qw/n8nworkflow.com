It saves hours of manual data collection and reporting, ensuring stakeholders receive timely updates automatically.\n\n### What it does\nThis workflow automates the entire process of creating and distributing regular analytics reports. On a recurring weekly and monthly schedule, it:\n1.  **Fetches Data:** Gathers the latest data from Google Analytics (users, sessions, conversions), your advertising platform (ad spend), and your CRM (new customers, revenue).\n2.  **Calculates KPIs:** Processes the raw data to calculate essential business metrics, including Monthly Active Users (MAU), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), LTV:CAC ratio, and conversion rates.\n3.  **Logs Historical Data:** Appends the newly calculated KPIs to a Google Sheet, creating a historical record for trend analysis.\n4.  **Generates a Report:** Creates a new Google Slides presentation to serve as the main report.\n5.  **Distributes the Report:** Emails a summary of the key metrics to a predefined list of recipients, including a link to the full Google Slides report.\n6.  **Provides Error Alerts:** If any step in the process fails, it sends an immediate notification to a designated Slack channel so you can address the issue quickly.\n\n### How to set up\n1.  **Configure Credentials:** Add your credentials for Google Analytics, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Gmail, Slack, and the HTTP Request nodes (for your ad platform and CRM).\n2.  **Fill in Placeholders:** In the \"Workflow Configuration\" node, replace all placeholder values with your specific information:\n    *   `gaPropertyId`: Your Google Analytics Property ID.\n    *   `adPlatformApiUrl`: The API endpoint for your advertising platform.\n    *   `crmApiUrl`: The API endpoint for your CRM.\n    *   `reportSpreadsheetId`: The ID of the Google Sheet where data will be stored.\n    *   `slidesTemplateId`: The ID of your Google Slides report template.\n    *   `reportRecipients`: A comma-separated list of email addresses for report distribution.\n    *   `slackChannel`: The Slack channel ID for error notifications.\n3.  **Activate Workflow:** Turn the workflow on. It will now run based on the schedule defined in the \"Weekly/Monthly Schedule\" trigger node.\n\n### How to customize the workflow\n*   **Adjust Schedule:** Modify the \"Weekly/Monthly Schedule\" node to change the reporting frequency (e.g., daily, bi-weekly).\n*   **Change Reporting Period:** In the \"Workflow Configuration\" node, change the `reportPeriodDays` value to adjust the lookback window (e.g., set to `30` for a monthly report).\n*   **Customize KPIs:** Edit the Javascript in the \"Calculate KPIs (MAU, LTV, CAC)\" node to add or modify metrics.\n*   **Enhance the Report:** Expand the \"Create Google Slides Report\" node to dynamically add charts and data from the calculated KPIs into the slides.",
