  "description": "# AI-powered Telegram message analysis with multi-tool notifications (Gmail, Telegram)\n\n \n*This workflow triggers on Telegram updates, analyzes messages with an AI Agent using MCP tools, and sends notifications via Gmail and Telegram.*\n\n## Detailed Description\n\n### Who is this for?\nThis template is for teams, businesses, or individuals using Telegram for communication who need automated, AI-driven insights and notifications. It’s ideal for customer support teams, project managers, or tech enthusiasts wanting to process Telegram messages intelligently and receive alerts via Gmail and Telegram.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?  Use case\nThis workflow solves the challenge of manually monitoring Telegram messages by automating message analysis and notifications. For example, a support team can use it to analyze customer queries on Telegram with AI tools (OpenAI, Airbnb, Brave, FireCrawl) and get notified via Gmail and Telegram for quick responses.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThe workflow:  \n1. Triggers on a Telegram update (e.g., a new message) using the **Listen for Telegram Updates** node.  \n2. Processes the message with the **Analyze Message with AI** node, an AI Agent using MCP tools like OpenAI Chat, Airbnb search, Brave search, and FireCrawl.  \n3. Sends notifications via the **Send Gmail Notification** and **Send Telegram Alert** nodes, including AI-generated insights.\n\n### Setup\n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Telegram bot token for the trigger and notification nodes.  \n- Gmail API credentials for sending emails.  \n- API keys for OpenAI, Airbnb, Brave, and FireCrawl (used in the AI Agent).  \n\n**Steps:**  \n1. Configure the **Listen for Telegram Updates** node with your Telegram bot token.  \n2. Set up the **Analyze Message with AI** node with your OpenAI API key and other tool credentials.  \n3. Configure the **Send Gmail Notification** node with your Gmail credentials.  \n4. Set up the **Send Telegram Alert** node with your Telegram bot token.  \n5. Test by sending a Telegram message to trigger the workflow.  \n\nSetup takes ~15-30 minutes. Detailed instructions are in sticky notes within the workflow.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- Add more AI tools (e.g., sentiment analysis) in the **Analyze Message with AI** node.  \n- Modify the notification message in the **Send Gmail Notification** and **Send Telegram Alert** nodes to include specific AI outputs.  \n- Add nodes for other channels like Slack or SMS after the AI Agent.\n\n### Disclaimer\n*This workflow uses Community nodes (e.g., Airbnb, Brave, FireCrawl), which are available only in self-hosted n8n instances. Ensure your n8n setup supports Community nodes before using this template.*",
