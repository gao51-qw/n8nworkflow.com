A workflow That Actually Helps People and helps you to promote your product and service.\n\n  Just spent hours fine-tuning an n8n automation that genuinely adds value to Reddit conversations and to your service, app, business or message that you want to promote. Here's what it does:\n\n  The Challenge: Finding relevant discussions where my service, app, business or message could actually help someone - without being spammy or salesy.\n\n  The Solution: An intelligent workflow that:\n  - 🔍 Monitors multiple subreddits for photo editing discussions\n  - 🧠 Uses GPT-4.1 to analyze comments (not just posts!) for genuine need\n  - 🎯 Filters out bots, moderators, and irrelevant content\n  - ✍️ Crafts helpful, conversational responses that provide value first\n  - 📊 Tracks everything in Google Sheets for transparency\n\n  Key Features:\n  - Runs every 3 hours automatically\n  - Analyzes comment context, not just keywords\n  - Only engages when the service, app, business or message is genuinely relevant\n  - Focuses on helping, mentions the app naturally if appropriate\n  - Respects Reddit culture and community guidelines\n\n  Why This Matters: Instead of blind self-promotion, this creates genuine interactions. When someone asks \"Anyone know a good service, app, business to do XYZ?\", they get a helpful response from someone\n  who's actually built a solution.\n\n  Tech Stack: n8n, OpenAI GPT-4, Reddit API, Google Sheets\n\n  The best part? It forces me to only engage where I can add real value. No spam, just helpful participation in communities I care about.\n\n  What automation challenges are you working on? Happy to share learnings!\n\n\nQuestions or feedback?: heniykb@gmail.com ",
