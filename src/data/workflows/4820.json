Manually analyzing and cleaning this data for insight is time-consuming.\n\nThis workflow solves the problem by:\n\n- Simulating real user search behavior via Bright Data MCP based AI Agent\n\n- Performing multi-platform search (Google, Bing, Yandex) in one unified flow\n\n- Extracting clean, human-readable results (stripping ads, navigation, etc.)\n\n- Structuring the content using Google Gemini LLM\n\n- Automating delivery via Webhook or saving to disk\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n**Input Fields Node:**\n\n- Accepts the search query\n\n- Accepts action for example - Perform a google search. Replace the action with bing, yandex etc. for other search providers\n\n- Accepts Webhook notification URL\n\n**Bright Data MCP Agent Execution:**\n\n- Triggers Bright Data’s intelligent search agent\n\n- Handles search navigation, result loading, pagination\n\n**Human Readable Data Extractor:**\n\n- Cleanses HTML, removes ads, footers, irrelevant links\n\n- Produces a readable narrative of results\n\n**Final Output Handling:**\n\n- Saves the processed response to disk\n\n- Sends the structured data to a Webhook for real-time use\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n1. Knowledge of Model Context Protocol (MCP) is highly essential. Please read this blog post - [model-context-protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)\n2. You need to have the [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/) account and do the necessary setup as mentioned in the **Setup** section below.\n3. You need to have the Google Gemini API Key. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)\n3. You need to install the Bright Data MCP Server [@brightdata/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightdata/mcp)\n4. You need to install the [n8n-nodes-mcp](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp)\n\n### Setup\n1. Please make sure to setup n8n locally with MCP Servers by navigating to [n8n-nodes-mcp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUb73ErUCsA)\n2. Please make sure to install the Bright Data MCP Server [@brightdata/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightdata/mcp)  on your local machine.\n3. Sign up at [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/).\n4. Create a Web Unlocker proxy zone called mcp_unlocker on Bright Data control panel.\n5. Navigate to Proxies & Scraping and create a new Web Unlocker zone by selecting Web Unlocker API under Scraping Solutions.\n6. In n8n, configure the Google Gemini(PaLM) Api account with the Google Gemini API key (or access through Vertex AI or proxy).\n7. In n8n, configure the credentials to connect with MCP Client (STDIO) account with the Bright Data MCP Server as shown below.\n\n![MCPClientAccount.png](fileId:1465)\n\nMake sure to copy the Bright Data API_TOKEN within the Environments textbox above as API_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt;\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n**Add Scheduled Execution**\n- Add a Cron trigger to run this workflow on a set schedule (e.g., daily/weekly keyword tracking).\n\n**Push Results to Custom Destinations**\n\nConnect output to:\n\n- Google Sheets (for analytics or dashboards)\n\n- PostgreSQL or MySQL DBs (for structured storage)\n\n- Notion or Airtable (for content pipelines)\n\n- Slack or Email (for alerting teams)\n\n\n**Customize Webhook Notifications**\n- Update the Webhook URL in the notification node to push processed results to external APIs, CRMs, or real-time dashboards.\n\n",
