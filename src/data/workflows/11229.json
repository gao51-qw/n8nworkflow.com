  "description": "# Purpose and Audience\nThis n8n workflow creates an automated Telegram bot that adds watermarks to images. When users send photos to the bot, it automatically processes them by applying a logo overlay and returns the watermarked version. The workflow is designed for content creators, businesses, or individuals who need a quick, automated way to brand their images without manual editing software.\n\n## 1. How It Works\nThe workflow operates through a series of connected steps:\n\n- Message Reception: A Telegram trigger listens for incoming messages from users\n- Image Validation: The system checks whether the message contains a photo; if not, it sends a friendly error message asking the user to send an image\n- Image Retrieval: When a photo is detected, the workflow fetches the file path from Telegram's servers and downloads the full-resolution image\n- Upload & Watermarking: The downloaded image is uploaded to ImageKit.io, where a transformation is applied to overlay a logo watermark at 70% opacity\n- Delivery: The watermarked image is automatically sent back to the user via Telegram\n\nThe entire process happens in seconds, providing users with instant watermarked images through a simple chat interface.\n\n## 2. Who Is It For\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n- Social media managers who need to quickly brand images before posting\n- Small business owners protecting their product photos with company logos\n- Content creators who want an easy way to watermark their work on the go\n- Marketing teams requiring consistent branding across visual content\n- Photographers offering quick preview watermarking for client galleries\n- Anyone looking for a mobile-friendly, automated watermarking solution without installing desktop software\n\nThe bot requires minimal technical knowledge to use—simply send an image and receive it back watermarked—making it accessible to non-technical users while being built on a powerful automation platform.",
