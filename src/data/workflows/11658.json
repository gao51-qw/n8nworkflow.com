  "description": "# Zoho CRM → AI‑Generated Competitive Battle Card \n\nThis workflow automatically analyzes competitor websites, which inseted in description field and generates a clean, structured AI‑powered Battle Card for every new Zoho CRM deal. It reads the competitor URL from the deal Description, scrapes the site, runs an AI analysis pipeline and updates the deal with pricing, differentiators, pros/cons and a concise sales battle summary — all fully automated.\n\n\n### Quick Implementation Steps\n\n1. Add Zoho CRM + Gmail OAuth2 + AI API credentials. \n2. Import workflow into n8n. \n3. create a new deal in zoho CRM.\n4. While creating Deal,Add a competitor URL inside the Zoho deal Description. \n5. Activate the workflow. \n6. Wait 5 minutes → Deal updates with AI‑generated Battle Card.\n\n\n## What It Does\nThis workflow removes the manual effort of researching competitors during a sales cycle. Every time a new deal is created, it checks the Description field for a competitor name and website. After validating both, it automatically fetches the competitor webpage and feeds the content into an AI analysis pipeline powered by LangChain.\n\nThe AI transforms the messy, unstructured webpage HTML into a readable, structured and ready‑to‑use Battle Card — including pricing overview, differentiating features, advantages, disadvantages and a compact sales battle summary. This data is pushed directly into the Deal Description and emailed to the sales team. No web research, no copy‑pasting, no manual formatting — the AI does everything.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\n- Sales teams wanting fast competitor intelligence. \n- SDR/BDR teams prepping before first calls. \n- Pre‑sales engineers making pitch notes. \n- Founders/Product teams monitoring competitor positioning. \n- Agencies building automation for CRM users. \n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n instance \n- Zoho CRM OAuth2 credentials \n- Gmail OAuth2 credentials \n- AI model provider API key (Gemini / OpenAI / Claude — interchangeable) \n- Deals containing a competitor name + competitor URL [Must Have]\n\n\n## How It Works & Setup\n\n### Step 1 — Cron Trigger  \nRuns every 5 minutes → pulls newly created deals and last run time.\n\n### Step 2 — Fetch Deals  \nRetrieves deals sorted by Created_Time.\n\n### Step 3 — Identify New Deals  \nFilters deals created after the last workflow run.\n\n### Step 4 — Validate Deal Description  \nEnsures the Description has: \n- Competitor name \n- Competitor website URL\n\n### Step 5 — Extract Competitor Info  \nRegex identifies and extracts the name + first valid URL in the Description.\n\n### Step 6 — Scrape Competitor Website  \nHTTP Request downloads the competitor webpage’s HTML.\n\n### Step 7 — AI‑Generated Battle Card Creation  \n\nThe AI pipeline (LangChain + your chosen LLM) transforms HTML into a structured JSON output containing: \n- Pricing Summary \n- Key Features \n- Pros \n- Cons \n- Battle Summary \n- Competitor Name\n\n### Step 8 — Update Zoho Deal  \nThe script saves the formatted AI Battle Card directly into the Deal Description.\n\n### Step 9 — Notify Sales  \nGmail node sends a summary email to the sales team.\n\n\n## How to Customize Nodes\n\n### Change the AI Output  \n\nEdit LangChain prompt to: \n- Add SWOT \n- Include pricing tiers \n- Include objections \n- Add competitor positioning \n- Add risk scoring\n\n### Change Where Battle Card Is Stored  \n\nModify the Zoho Update node to store data in: \n- Notes \n- Custom fields\n- Attachments \n- Tags \n- Tasks\n\n### Email Customization  \nUpdate subject, body, recipients, etc.\n\n### Filtering Logic  \nModify filters to: \n- Only process specific deal stages \n- Only process certain pipelines \n- Ignore internal test deals \n\n\n## Add‑Ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\n- Auto‑generate a **PDF Battle Card** and attach it to the deal. \n- Send Battle Cards to **Slack**, **Teams**, or a WhatsApp bot. \n- Store all Battle Cards in **Notion**, **Airtable**, or **Google Sheets**. \n- Add a **competitor scoring system** (price, features, risk level). \n- Build a **weekly digest** of all competitors analyzed. \n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n1. **Instant competitor breakdown** when a new lead or deal is created. \n2. **Rapid sales call preparation** with AI summarizing the competition. \n3. **Automated enrichment** of CRM records with meaningful intelligence. \n4. **Internal competitive intelligence dashboards** fed by AI outputs. \n5. **Pitch deck automation** where Battle Cards update slides automatically.\n\nThere are many more possible use cases depending on your CRM setup and AI strategy.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------------|----------|\n| No Battle Card generated | No URL found in Description | Add valid http/https competitor URL |\n| Deal skipped | Time filtering excluded it | Adjust lookback window in code |\n| AI output incomplete | HTML unreadable or blocked | Try different competitor URL |\n| Zoho update fails | OAuth scope missing | Reconnect Zoho with full CRM access |\n| Email not sent | Gmail OAuth expired | Reconnect Gmail |\n| AI output wrong format | Prompt mismatched | Update output schema and prompt |\n\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you need help customizing prompts, enhancing automations or building full‑scale AI workflows, then our [n8n automation developers](https://www.weblineindia.com/hire-n8n-developers/) at WeblineIndia can support:\n\n- AI automations \n- LangChain pipelines \n- CRM integrations \n- n8n workflow development \n- Competitive intelligence tooling \n- And so much more.",
