It is particularly helpful for those who need to convert discussions into actionable items swiftly and effectively.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve?\nManaging action items from meetings can often lead to missed tasks and poor follow-up. This automation alleviates that issue by automatically generating tasks from meeting transcripts, keeping everyone informed about their responsibilities and streamlining communication.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThe workflow leverages n8n to create a Smart Agent that listens for completed meeting transcripts, processes them using AI, and generates tasks in Airtable. Key functionalities include:\n- Capturing completed meeting events through webhooks.\n- Extracting relevant meeting details such as transcripts and participants using API calls.\n- Generating structured tasks from meeting discussions and sending notifications to clients.\n\n1. **Webhook Integration**: Listens for meeting completion events to trigger subsequent actions.\n2. **API Requests for Data**: Pulls necessary details like transcripts and participant information from Fireflies.\n3. **Task and Notification Generation**: Automatically creates tasks in Airtable and notifies clients of their responsibilities.\n\n### Setup\n\n#### N8N Workflow\n1. **Configure the Webhook**: \n   - Set up a webhook to capture meeting completion events and integrate it with Fireflies.\n\n2. **Retrieve Meeting Content**: \n   - Use GraphQL API requests to extract meeting details and transcripts, ensuring appropriate authentication through Bearer tokens.\n\n3. **AI Processing Setup**: \n   - Define system messages for AI tasks and configure connections to the AI chat model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to process transcripts.\n\n4. **Task Creation Logic**: \n   - Create structured tasks based on AI output, ensuring necessary details are captured and records are created in Airtable.\n\n5. **Client Notifications**: \n   - Use an email node to notify clients about their tasks, ensuring communications are client-specific.\n\n6. **Scheduling Follow-Up Calls**: \n   - Set up Google Calendar events if follow-up meetings are required, populating details from the original meeting context.\n",
