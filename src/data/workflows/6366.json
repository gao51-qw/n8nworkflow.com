  "description": "**Description:**\n\nEasily extract, download, and organize multiple JSON files from Google Drive using this no-code automation template for n8n. Ideal for operations, analysts, or data engineers managing bulk document processing, this workflow reads a Google Sheet containing file names and Google Drive URLs, converts those links into downloadable JSONs, and automatically writes each file to a local disk folder—sorted by name.\n\nNo more manual downloading or copy-pasting. Everything is processed in a structured loop, ensuring reliable and scalable folder-based separation of your JSON data files.\n\n**What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)**\n\n🟢 Trigger: Manual Execution: Initiates the flow when you click “Execute Workflow” in n8n.\n\n📄 Google Sheet Reader: Connects to your Google Sheet to fetch rows with columns like Name and Google Drive URL.\n\n🧹 Clean & Filter Data (Python Code Node): Filters out rows missing name or URL. Keeps only valid entries to prevent failure in downstream steps.\n\n🔗 Convert Drive URL to Download Link (JavaScript Code): Extracts the Google Drive File ID and transforms it into a direct download link for each JSON file.\n\n🔁 Batch Looping for Controlled Processing: Uses SplitInBatches to handle each file sequentially to avoid system overload.\n\n📥 Download JSON File via HTTP Request: Makes a GET request to each file’s download URL and loads it as binary data into memory.\n\n🗂️ Generate Local Path for Each File: Prepares the path C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/Healthcare/{filename}.json using the name from the sheet.\n\n💾 Write File to Disk:Saves each JSON file to the local disk at the generated path, effectively separating each entry into its own file.\n\n**Required Integrations**\n\n✅ Google Sheets OAuth2 API (for reading file metadata)\n✅ Local write permissions (for saving files to disk)\n\n**Perfect For**\n\n📦 Bulk JSON Extraction Pipelines\n🏥 Healthcare or Data Ops Teams managing case records or medical file links\n🧾 Invoice or Document Download Automations\n📁 Content Management or Archival Processes\n\n**Why Use This Template?**\n\n- No manual downloads or folder sorting\n- Safe and batch-based processing prevents overload\n- Easily customizable folder paths and formats\n- Great for non-technical users managing large file repositories",
