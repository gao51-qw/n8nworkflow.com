This workflow uses AI to analyze daily performance, summarize key metrics, identify blockers, and deliver polished reports directly to Slack, Email, and Google Drive. ⚙️📊💬\n\n## What This Template Does\n- Triggers automatically every weekday at 6:00 PM (Mon–Fri). ⏰\n- Fetches all completed ClickUp tasks and won GoHighLevel opportunities for the day. 📥\n- Merges and transforms both datasets into a unified structure. 🔄\n- Uses Azure OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze performance and generate structured summaries. 🤖\n- Formats three output versions — Slack (Markdown), Email (HTML), and Google Drive (Text). 🧾\n- Routes and sends reports automatically to connected channels. 📤\n- Uploads the generated text report to Google Drive with timestamped filenames. ☁️\n\n## Key Benefits\n✅ Saves time by automating daily performance reporting.\n ✅ Unifies task and deal data into a single AI-generated summary.\n ✅ Provides real-time visibility into productivity and outcomes.\n ✅ Delivers beautifully formatted, channel-specific reports.\n ✅ Maintains historical reports in Google Drive for reference.\n ✅ Helps managers identify wins, blockers, and next steps quickly.\n\n## Features\n- Automated scheduling via cron (Mon–Fri, 6 PM).\n- ClickUp task and GHL opportunity integration for daily data sync.\n- AI-powered analysis for contextual, actionable summaries.\n- Dynamic formatting for Slack, Email, and Drive outputs.\n- Parallel routing for simultaneous delivery across platforms.\n- No manual steps — runs fully hands-free after setup.\n\n## Requirements\n- ClickUp OAuth2 credentials for task retrieval.\n- GoHighLevel OAuth2 credentials for deal data.\n- Azure OpenAI GPT-4 API credentials.\n- Slack Bot credentials for message posting.\n- SMTP (Gmail/Outlook) credentials for email reports.\n- Google Drive OAuth2 credentials for report upload.\n\n## Target Audience\n🎯 Sales, marketing, and operations teams tracking daily performance.\n 📈 Project managers monitoring team productivity and blockers.\n 🤝 Client success teams summarizing EOD outcomes for leadership.\n 🧠 Business automation teams seeking end-of-day visibility.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n- Connect ClickUp, GoHighLevel, Slack, Gmail/SMTP, and Google Drive credentials. 🔑\n- Set your team, space, folder, and list IDs in the ClickUp node. 📋\n- Update your Slack channel ID in the Slack node configuration. 💬\n- Configure your email sender and recipients in the email node. 📧\n- (Optional) Modify the cron expression for different reporting times. ⏰\n- Test the workflow manually once, then activate for automated EOD execution. ✅",
