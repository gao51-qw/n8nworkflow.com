It’s ideal for **B2B, SaaS, and tech professionals** looking for fresh LinkedIn post ideas or trend insights.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \nThis workflow automatically:  \n1. **Fetches Reddit posts & comments** based on a selected subreddit and keyword.  \n2. **Extracts pain points & insights** using OpenAI (ChatGPT) to identify key frustrations and trends.  \n3. **Generates LinkedIn post ideas** with headlines, hooks, and CTAs tailored for professional audiences.  \n4. **Saves all results into Google Sheets** for easy tracking, editing, and sharing.\n\nIt uses AI to turn unstructured Reddit conversations into actionable content marketing opportunities.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Clone this workflow in your n8n instance.  \n2. **Configure credentials**:  \n   - **Reddit OAuth2** (for fetching posts & comments)  \n   - **OpenAI API key** (no hardcoding—use credentials in n8n)  \n   - **Google Sheets OAuth2** (for output)  \n3. Run the workflow or trigger it using the built-in **Form Trigger** (provide subreddit & keyword).  \n4. Check the generated **Google Sheet** for analyzed insights and post suggestions.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- Reddit account with API credentials  \n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4o recommended)  \n- Google Sheets account  \n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- Change the **AI prompt** to adjust tone or depth of insights.  \n- Add filtering logic to target posts with higher engagement.  \n- Modify the Google Sheets output schema to include custom fields.  \n- Extend it with Slack/Email notifications to instantly share top insights.",
