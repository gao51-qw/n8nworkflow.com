  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis workflow is an AI-powered Booking Assistant that automates restaurant and event reservations through Telegram. It interacts with the user in natural conversation, collects booking details (guest count, preferences, date/time, and special requests), finalizes the draft, and confirms the reservation by storing it in Google Calendar and sending an email confirmation — fully automated end-to-end.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. User Interaction\n- The workflow starts with a Telegram welcome message.  \n- The AI agent asks step-by-step questions:  \n  - Number of guests  \n  - Seating preference (indoor/outdoor/private room)  \n  - Special occasion requests (birthday, date, etc.)  \n  - Preferred date & time  \n- Once details are gathered, it generates a draft booking summary.\n\n### 2. Confirmation & Personal Details\n- The user reviews the draft and confirms.  \n- The assistant then asks for personal details (name, email, phone number).\n\n### 3. Booking & Notifications\n- After confirmation, the details are sent to Google Calendar to create an event.  \n- A confirmation email is sent to the user with all booking information.  \n- A final Telegram message confirms that the reservation is successfully completed.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n- Triggered directly from Telegram Bot.  \n- Simply start chatting with the bot to begin the reservation process.  \n- The assistant will guide the user step by step until the booking is finalized.  \n- Once completed, the user receives both an email confirmation and a Telegram confirmation message.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\nTo use this workflow, you’ll need:  \n- n8n account (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- Telegram Bot Token (for chat interaction)  \n- OpenAI or OpenRouter API Key (for AI-driven conversation)  \n- Google Calendar API access (to create bookings)  \n- Gmail / SMTP credentials (to send confirmation emails)  \n",
