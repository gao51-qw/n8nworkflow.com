Based on your use-case, set the value of the ***Batch Size***.\n\n**IF node:** This node check if all the data by the SplitInBatches are not processed or not. It uses the expression `{{$node[\"SplitInBatches\"].context[\"noItemsLeft\"]}}` which returns a boolean value.\nIf there is data yet to be processed, the expression will return `false`, otherwise `true`.\n\n**Set node:** This node prints a message `No Items Left`. Based on your use-case, connect the false output of the *IF* node to the input of the node you want to execute, after the data is processed by the *SplitInBatches* node.",
