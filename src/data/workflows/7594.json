  "description": "# Summarize Gmail Support Emails with Gemini and Post to Slack\n\nThis workflow automatically checks your Gmail inbox for new support emails, summarizes them using **Google Gemini** and posts concise summaries directly into **Slack**. Instead of manually reading long support emails, your team can stay updated with short, actionable insights in real-time.\n\n\n## Who’s it for\n\n* **Customer Support Teams** – to stay on top of support tickets without reading lengthy emails.\n* **Operations Managers** – who need quick insights on issues raised by customers.\n* **Engineering Teams** – who want alerts and summaries of support escalations in Slack.\n* **Founders/Execs** – who prefer high-level summaries rather than full email threads.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Gmail Trigger – Check Support Emails**\n\t* The workflow runs every minute to detect new incoming emails in your support inbox.\n\n2. **Forward Email to Gemini for Summarization**\n\n\t* Extracts the email body and prepares it for the LLM model.\n\n3. **Gemini – Summarize Support Email**\n\n\t* Google Gemini condenses the email into a short, clear summary.\n\n4. **Slack – Post Summary to Channel**\n\n\t* The summarized text is sent to your chosen Slack channel for instant visibility.\n\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect your **Gmail account** in n8n.\n2. Configure the Gmail Trigger to check emails from your support inbox (or apply filters like subject = “Support” or label = “Support”).\n3. Add your **Google Gemini API credentials** in n8n.\n4. Configure Gemini with a summarization prompt (e.g., “Summarize this email in 3 bullet points”).\n5. Connect your **Slack account** and select the target channel.\n6. Save and activate the workflow.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud).\n* **Google Account** with Gmail API enabled.\n* **Google Gemini API access** (API key).\n* **Slack workspace** with a bot token and permission to post messages.\n\n\n## How to customize\n\n* Change the **email filters** in the Gmail Trigger (e.g., only unread emails, only with label `Support`).\n* Modify the **summarization style** in Gemini (bullet points, short paragraph, etc.).\n* Choose a different **Slack channel** for posting (e.g., #support, #alerts, #dev-team).\n* Add additional nodes for **logging into Google Sheets** or **creating Jira tickets**.\n\n\n## Add-ons\n\n* Save original emails + summaries into **Google Sheets** for tracking.\n* Create **Jira or Trello tasks** automatically for high-priority issues.\n* Add a **translation step** if support emails arrive in multiple languages.\n* Integrate with **Zendesk** or **Freshdesk** if you also use those tools.\n* Integrate OpenAI LLM models.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n* Customer sends a bug report → Gemini summarizes key points → Slack post alerts dev team instantly.\n* Support email with long back-and-forth conversation → condensed into a 3-line summary in Slack.\n* Team lead checks Slack daily instead of logging into Gmail to stay informed.\n\n\n## Common Troubleshooting\n\n| **Issue** | **Possible Cause** | **Solution** |\n| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| No emails detected | Gmail Trigger not configured properly | Check Gmail Trigger settings and labels/filters. |\n| Gemini not summarizing | API key missing or invalid | Re-add Gemini API credentials in n8n. |\n| Slack not receiving messages | Slack auth expired or wrong channel | Reconnect Slack account and verify channel ID. |\n| Workflow runs but nothing posted | Summarization output empty | Adjust Gemini prompt or check email format (HTML vs plain text). |\n\n\n## 👨‍💻Need help?\n\nIf you need assistance setting up or customizing this workflow, feel free to reach out WeblineIndia. We can help you:\n\n* Configure Gmail filters.\n* Optimize Gemini prompts for better summaries.\n* Connect Slack and set up advanced alerts.\n* Extend the workflow with Sheets, Jira or other integrations.",
