  "description": "## This workflow processes emails received in Gmail and adds the sender's **name** and **email address** to a MySQL database.\n\n## Use Cases:\n- A sales or marketing agency can use this to automatically save client contact info to a database to build a list of leads\n- Companies can use this to automatically save contacts to a database in case of Gmail data loss / losing access to their Gmail account\n- Companies can build mailing lists to automatically send promotions to all of the clients who have contacted them in a given time period\n\n## Before using, you need to have:\n- Gmail credential\n- MySQL database credential\n- A Table in the MySQL database to store your contacts\n- The table should have a \"name\" column, which allows NULL values\n- The table should have an \"email\" column, which should be UNIQUE\n\n## How it works:\n- The Gmail Trigger will listen for a new email every minute\n- For each email, the code node will extract the name and email address of the sender. If there is no name, it will return null\n- The MySQL node will insert the new contact into a table in your database\n- If the contact email already exists in your database, the MySQL node will update the contact name\n\n\n## How to use:\n- Please set up the MySQL node by selecting the correct table to store contacts in\n- Please choose your \"email\" column to match on\n- Please choose your \"name\" column to store names\n\n## Customizing this Workflow:\n- You can customize this workflow to save more data to MySQL. Here are some examples:\n- In the MySQL node, click \"Add Value\", and choose one of the fields from the Gmail node to save in your database column. You can try saving the following items:\n  - Subject line\n  - MessageID\n  - ThreadID\n  - Snippet\n  - Recipient Info",
