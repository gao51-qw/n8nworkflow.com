You can change the frequency in the **Schedule Trigger** node.\n\n4. **Modify the AI logic (optional):**\n   - Update the AI Agent prompt to detect additional types like receipts or payment confirmations.\n\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Notify a Slack channel instead of a user:** Just switch the recipient in the Slack node.\n- **Add labels in Gmail:** Add nodes to label or archive invoice emails once detected.\n- **Expand detection:** Modify the AI prompt to detect other financial or transactional emails.\n",
