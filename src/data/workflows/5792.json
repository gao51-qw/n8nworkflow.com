  "title": "Create literary English/German to Chinese dictionary with GPT-4o-mini & Supabase",
  "description": "## **Description**\nThis workflow creates a sophisticated bilingual dictionary that provides literary-style definitions and examples for English and German words. The system automatically detects the input language, generates comprehensive definitions in Chinese, creates three literary-style example sentences with translations, and stores everything in a Supabase database for future reference.\n\n## Who Is This For?\n- Language Learners & Students: Perfect for those studying English or German who want to understand words in literary contexts with Chinese translations.\n- Writers & Content Creators: Ideal for bilingual writers working with English, German, and Chinese who need rich, literary examples for their work.\n- Educators & Translators: Excellent tool for language teachers and professional translators who need comprehensive word definitions with contextual examples.\n- Literary Enthusiasts: Great for readers of literature who encounter unfamiliar words and want to understand their poetic or literary usage.\n## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nTraditional dictionaries often provide basic definitions without literary context or cross-language examples. This workflow addresses several key challenges:\n- Limited Literary Context: Most dictionaries lack poetic, expressive, or literary-style examples that help understand how words are used in sophisticated writing.\n- Cross-Language Learning: Provides seamless translation between English/German and Chinese with culturally appropriate examples.\n- Data Persistence: Automatically saves all lookups to a database, creating a personalized vocabulary collection over time.\n- API Accessibility: Provides a clean webhook interface that can be integrated into apps, websites, or other tools.\n\n## How It Works\n### Main Dictionary Lookup Flow\n1. Input Processing: Receives a word via webhook POST request and automatically detects if it's English or German\n2. AI Analysis: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to generate comprehensive definitions with literary context\n3. Response Formatting: Processes the AI response to extract structured data (word, meaning, examples)\n4. Quality Control: Validates the response and handles unclear or invalid inputs gracefully\n5. Database Storage: Saves the word, Chinese meaning, and examples to Supabase for future reference\n6. API Response: Returns formatted JSON with the complete dictionary entry\n### Data Storage Flow\n1. Parallel Processing: Simultaneously returns the dictionary data to the user and saves it to the database\n2. Structured Storage: Organizes data in Supabase with fields for words, Chinese meanings, and example arrays\n3. Success Confirmation: Provides confirmation when data is successfully stored\n## Setup Instructions\n### Prerequisites & Accounts\nYou'll need accounts and API access for:\n- n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)\n- OpenAI (API key required)\n- Supabase (Database and API credentials)\n### Webhook Configuration\n- The workflow uses two webhook endpoints with the same path for different operations\n- Note the webhook URL provided by n8n for API integration\n- Test the webhook endpoints to ensure they're accessible\napproach\n## Customization Options\n- Extend to support additional input languages by modifying the AI prompt\n- Add support for other target languages beyond Chinese\n- Customize the literary style for different cultural contexts\n\nThis workflow transforms simple word lookups into rich, contextual learning experiences while building a personalized vocabulary database over time.\n",
