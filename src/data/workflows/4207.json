It's ideal for triggering timely outreach, updating CRM records, or feeding lead scoring workflows based on new roles.\n\n## What This Automation Does\nIt scrapes your LinkedIn \"Job Changes\" feed and returns:\n- Name of the person\n- Their new position\n- LinkedIn profile URL\n- Functional category (e.g., marketing, sales, HR, executive)\n\nEach run processes 5 job changes at a time.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Starts the workflow when the user clicks \"Test workflow.\"\n2. **Airtop Enrichment**: Navigates to the LinkedIn job changes page and extracts:\n   - `name`\n   - `new_position`\n   - `linkedin_profile_url`\n   - `position_function` (classification such as marketing, sales, HR, etc.)\n3. **Formatting**: Output is structured into clean JSON for use in further workflows.\n\n## Setup Requirements\n1. [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to LinkedIn\n2. Airtop API key configured in n8n\n3. A LinkedIn account with a populated “Job Changes” feed\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Automate Alerts**: Add Slack, email, or CRM integrations to notify your team.\n- **Enrich and Score Leads**: Chain this with your ICP scoring workflow to evaluate new roles.\n- **Customize Scope**: Expand extraction to more than 5 job changes or add filters based on job titles or functions.\n\nRead more about [Monitoring Job Changes on Linkedin](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/monitor-job-changes-on-linkedin-n8n).\n",
