Built on Azure OpenAI Chat with Structured Output Parser and true/false routing for escalation.\n\n## What This Template Does \n- Trigger for new data: Starts when a new profile, survey, or report file is added.\n- Download & extract: Retrieves the file and converts PDFs/text into analyzable content.\n- Analyze signals: Uses Azure OpenAI Chat to interpret sentiment, workload, performance notes, feedback, and changes (role, compensation, manager, location).\n- Structured parsing: Maps to fields like risk_score, risk_level, key_drivers, recommended_interventions, escalation_required.\n- Logic routing: Applies thresholds (e.g., risk_score ≥ 0.7) and flags for urgent follow-up.\n- Email alerts: Drafts and sends tailored notifications to HR/manager with action steps.\n\n## Key Signals Considered \n- Sentiment & language: Negative tone, burnout cues, disengagement in feedback.\n- Activity trends: Drop in participation, delayed responses, meeting absenteeism.\n- Performance & goals: Recent rating changes, missed OKRs, quality issues.\n- Role & compensation: Lateral moves, pay gaps vs. market, stalled progression.\n- Managerial context: Team churn, conflict mentions, low recognition frequency.\n\n## Features \n- Azure OpenAI Chat: Interprets unstructured text into consistent risk fields.\n- Structured Output Parser: Guarantees schema for downstream decisions.\n- Conditional Logic (true/false): Threshold checks for escalation.\n- Memory: Maintains context across multiple files per employee for trend-aware scoring.\n- Calculate avg span: Computes tenure or recency metrics used in risk scoring.\n- Email Composer & Sender: Generates and dispatches HR-ready alerts.\n\n## Requirements \n- n8n instance with access to employee data sources (Drive, Inbox, HR folder).\n- Extract From PDF configured for clean text output.\n- Azure OpenAI credentials (e.g., GPT‑4o‑mini) connected to Chat Model.\n- Email service (Gmail/SMTP) set in n8n Credentials.\n- Parser schema aligned to your People Analytics fields (risk_score, drivers, actions).",
