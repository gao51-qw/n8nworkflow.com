Designed specifically for commercial insurance brokers and agents, this workflow transforms the tedious process of manual application submissions into a streamlined, one-click operation. Stop wasting hours on administrative tasks and start closing more deals. This template handles everything from reading new applications in a Google Sheet to generating custom PDFs and emailing them to the right carriers all in **40 seconds**, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your clients.\n\n### How it works\n\nThis workflow provides a powerful foundation for automating your commercial insurance submissions. It's designed to save you hours of manual work by streamlining the entire process from application intake to carrier communication.\n\nAt a high level, this is what the flow does:\n\n* **1. Fetches New Applications:** Automatically reads new insurance applications from a designated Google Sheet.\n* **2. Filters Suitable Carriers:** Filters a built-in list of carriers to find the best matches for each application based on revenue and industry requirements.\n* **3. Generates Professional PDFs:** For each matched carrier, it automatically generates a professional PDF application using a pre-formatted Google Docs template.\n* **4. Distributes to Carriers:** Emails the personalized application and unique PDF attachment to each matched carrier.\n* **5. Creates a Summary Report:** Once all submissions are complete, it generates a clean HTML summary report and emails it to the broker.\n\n### Set up steps\n\n**Estimated Set Up Time:** 10-15 minutes\n\nThis template is designed for a quick setup. The detailed, step-by-step instructions are included in the Sticky Notes inside the workflow itself.\n\nThe main setup steps are:\n\n* **1. Copy the Google Sheet:** Make a copy of the provided Google Sheet template to your own Google Drive.\n* **2. Connect Your Google Account:** Authorize your Google account for the three required nodes (Google Sheets, Google Drive, and Google Docs).\n* **3. Configure Your Email:** Add your email credentials to the two `Email Send` nodes (one for sending to carriers and one for notifying the broker).",
