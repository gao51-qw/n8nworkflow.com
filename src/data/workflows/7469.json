If you want to save time by having candidate data and AI scores automatically organized in Google Sheets, this workflow is for you.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n- Monitors a Gmail inbox for new emails with resume attachments (PDF)\n- Extracts the job title from the email subject and matches it against open positions stored in Airtable\n- Uploads the resume file to a designated Google Drive folder for storage\n- Builds a prompt with all relevant context and sends it, along with the resume file, to Gemini AI for analysis\n- Gemini scores the candidate, extracts their name and phone, and provides a one-sentence explanation\n- All results—including candidate info, AI score, feedback, and a download link for the resume—are appended as new rows in Google Sheets\n\n---\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Create accounts and APIs**: You’ll need Google (Gmail, Drive, Sheets), Airtable, and Gemini API access.\n2. **Prepare your Airtable base**: Add your job descriptions (title, code, description, skills, etc.)—these are matched against incoming applications.\n3. **Prepare your Google Sheet**: Create a spreadsheet to store applicant data and scores.\n4. **Connect credentials in n8n**: Set up Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Airtable, and Gemini API credentials in n8n’s credential manager.\n5. **Import this workflow**: Use the workflow import feature in n8n and connect your credentials to each node.\n6. **Test**: Send a test application email with a PDF resume to your connected Gmail—watch the data appear in Google Sheets!\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Google account with access to Gmail, Drive, and Sheets\n- Airtable account for job data\n- Gemini API key (no hardcoded keys—use n8n environment variables or credentials)\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n\n---\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Job matching logic**: Edit the EmailMatcher node to fine-tune how subjects are matched to job titles.\n- **Scoring criteria**: Adjust the prompt in PromptBuilder to change what Gemini evaluates.\n- **Supported file types**: Modify the ReadyAttachment node to accept other resume formats if needed.\n- **Sheet columns**: Edit the Google Sheets node to map new data points or change the output format.\n- **Notifications**: Add Slack or email nodes to notify you when a strong candidate is found.\n\n---",
