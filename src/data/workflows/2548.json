  "title": "Convert URL-encoded webhook data from amoCRM to structured array",
  "description": "This template processes webhooks received from amoCRM in a URL-encoded format and transforms the data into a structured array that n8n can easily interpret. \nBy default, n8n does not automatically parse URL-encoded webhook payloads into usable JSON. This template bridges that gap, enabling seamless data manipulation and integration with subsequent processing nodes.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Input Handling: Processes URL-encoded data received from amoCRM webhooks.\n- Data Transformation: Converts complex, nested keys into a structured JSON array.\n- Ease of Use: Simplifies access to specific fields for further workflow automation.\n\n**Setup Guide:**\n- Webhook Trigger Node: Configure the Webhook Trigger node to receive data from amoCRM.\n- URL-Encoding Parsing: Use the provided nodes to transform the input URL-encoded data into a structured array.\n- Access Transformed Data: Use the resulting JSON structure for subsequent nodes in your workflow, such as filtering, updating records, or triggering external systems.\n\n**Example Data Transformation:**\n- Sample Input (URL-Encoded):\nThe following input format is typically received from amoCRM:\n$json.body['leads[update][0][custom_fields][0][id]']  \n\n- Output (Structured JSON):\nAfter processing, the data is transformed into an easily accessible JSON array format:\n{{ $json.leads.update[‘0’].id }}  \n\nThis output allows you to work with clean, structured JSON, simplifying field extraction and workflow continuation.\n\n**Code Explanation:**\nThis workflow parses URL-encoded key-value pairs using n8n nodes to restructure the data into a nested JSON object. By doing so, the template improves transparency, ensures data integrity, and makes further automation tasks straightforward.\n\n",
