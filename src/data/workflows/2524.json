Create a new n8n workflow.\n2. Add the nodes: Schedule Trigger, HTTP Request, If, and Twilio.\n3. Configure the nodes:\n- Schedule Trigger: Specify the desired interval.\n- HTTP Request: Enter the URL of the service to be monitored.\n- If: Set the condition to check for a status code other than 200.\n4. Twilio: Enter the Twilio account credentials and the phone numbers for sending and receiving the SMS notification.\n5. Connect the nodes: Connect the nodes as shown in the workflow diagram.\n6. Activate the workflow: Save the workflow and activate it.\n\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- The workflow can be customized by changing the interval, the URL, the Twilio credentials, and the SMS message.\n- This workflow is a simple example, and more complex workflows can be created to meet specific needs.",
