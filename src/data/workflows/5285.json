  "description": "This workflow integrates iOS Shortcuts with n8n to create a simple, automatic location-based reminder system. When the user arrives at a specified location, an automation in the Shortcuts app sends a webhook trigger to n8n. If the trigger matches predefined date and time conditions, n8n sends a Telegram message reminder to the user.\n\nThis is perfect for repetitive weekly tasks like taking out the bins, customized with conditions for day and time.\n\n## Key Features\n- Location-Based Trigger: Uses iOS Shortcuts automation to start the workflow upon arrival at a specific location.\n- Time and Day Validation: Logic in n8n checks current weekday and time to ensure reminders are sent only when appropriate.\n- Telegram Integration: Sends reminders directly to your Telegram account using your bot.\n- Minimal Setup: Uses native iOS and simple webhook setup in n8n.\n\n## How It Works\n1. iOS Shortcut Trigger: When the user arrives at a designated location, the iOS shortcut sends a GET request to the n8n webhook.\n2. n8n Webhook Node: Receives the request and triggers the workflow.\n3. Conditional Check: An IF node checks if the current time is after 4:00 PM and it's a Wednesday (or any other configured condition).\n4. Telegram Node: If the condition passes, n8n sends a message like \"Don't forget to take the bins out.\" to your Telegram bot.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Create a Telegram Bot:\n\t- Use **@BotFather** to create a bot and obtain your bot token.\n\t- Add Telegram API credentials in n8n with your bot token.\n2. Setup iOS Shortcut:\n\t- Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.\n\t- Go to the **Automation** tab → Tap **+** → Create Personal Automation.\n\t- Choose Arrive → Select a location.\n\t- Add action: **Get Contents of URL**.\nMethod: **GET**, URL: your n8n Webhook URL (e.g. https://n8n.yourdomain.com/webhook/your-path).\n\t-\tSave the automation. (You can also test the automation by pressing the Play button)\n\n3. Import Workflow into n8n:\n\t-\tLoad the provided workflow JSON.\n\t-\tSet your webhook path and Telegram credentials.\n\t-\tAdjust the logic in the IF node to your usecase. In my case, I check if today is Wednesday and after 4 PM until Midnight.\n\n4. Expose n8n Publicly: Ensure your n8n instance is publicly accessible via HTTPS so the shortcut can reach it.\n\n## Customization Guidance\n- Change Reminder Message: Modify the text inside the Telegram node to suit different reminders.\n- Add More Conditions: Extend the logic to support more days, hours, or different trigger messages.\n- Add Multi-Channel Output: Send reminders via email, SMS, or Slack in addition to Telegram.\n- Use More Triggers: Expand to other types of shortcut triggers (e.g. NFC tag, leaving location, time of day).\n\n## Security and Implementation\n- Webhook Protection: Avoid using easily guessable webhook URLs.\n- Secure Telegram Token: Store your bot token securely in n8n credentials, not in plain workflow text.\n- Limit Shortcut Scope: Only trigger the shortcut at trusted locations or with secure iCloud sync.\n- Automation Permissions: Ensure your iPhone allows shortcut automations to run without confirmation.\n\n## Benefits\n- Automates repetitive location-based reminders without user interaction.\n- Provides a lightweight, native solution using iOS and n8n with no extra apps.\n- Keeps you on track for routine tasks like garbage days, medicine reminders, or arrival-based tasks.\n- Easily extendable for multiple locations or trigger conditions.",
