You can easily adapt it for any niche by editing prompts, adding nodes, and creating or uploading a variety of content to any platform. You can use any LLM and generative AI of your choice. Personally, I prefer the smooth and effective results from ChatGPT 4.1 combined with GPT Image 1. But you can generate videos instead of images for your posts as well 😉\n\n**What Problem Is This Workflow Solving?**\n\n🤦‍♂️ Many auto service businesses struggle with consistently posting engaging content due to time constraints or lack of marketing expertise. \n## 💎This workflow solves that by automating the content creation and posting process, ensuring your social media channels stay fresh and active, ultimately attracting more customers.\n\n**What This Workflow Does:**\n\n- Generates daily social media posts tailored specifically to the auto service niche using AI.\n- Allows easy customization of post and image prompts.\n- Integrates research links through the Tavily Internet Search tool for relevant content.\n- Supports starting posts based on reference article links via Google Sheets.\n- Automatically publishes posts to your connected social media platforms.\n- Enables scheduled or trigger-based posting for maximum flexibility.\n\n**How It Works?**\n\nEasy, actually ☺️ \n\nAI creates daily social media content made just for Auto Service. You can simply edit prompts for both posts and images, set up news or articles research links via the Tavily Internet Search tool. You can also start the workflow with a reference article link through Google Sheets.\n\n## 🎯 Consistently posting relevant and actual niche content helps attract new customers, all while leveraging AI and n8n tools to keep the process seamless and cost-effective. \n\n**Set Up Steps:**\n\nI kept it quick and simple for you ✨\n\n- If you’re happy with the current LLM and image model configurations, just connect your OpenAI API credentials to enable AI content generation.\n- Link your social media accounts (Facebook, Telegram, X, etc.) for autoposting.\n- Optionally connect Google Sheets if you want to trigger posts based on sheet updates with reference links.\n- Customize prompts as needed to match your brand voice, style and marketing tasks.\n- Choose between:\n1) Scheduled automatic generation and posting at the same time as socials algorythms like it.\n2) Google Sheets trigger with reference.\n3) Manual start.\n\n**How to Customize This Workflow to Your Needs?**\n- Switch AI models and edit prompts to better reflect your specific services or promotions.\n- Add or modify research links in Tavily to keep your posts timely and relevant.\n- Adjust posting schedules to match peak engagement times for your audience.\n- Expand or reduce the number of social platforms integrated depending on your marketing strategy.\n- Use Google Sheets to batch upload ideas or curate specific content topics.\n\n\nAfter adjusting a few settings, activate the workflow and let it run. \n\n🤖 The system will then automatically publish your content across your selected social platforms — saving you time and effort. \n\n![ai output example 2.jpg](fileId:1429)![ai output example 3.jpg](fileId:1430)![ai output example 1.jpg](fileId:1431)\n\n📌 You’ll find more detailed tips and additional ai models for customizing ai generation process inside the workflow via sticky notes.\n\n💬 Need help?
