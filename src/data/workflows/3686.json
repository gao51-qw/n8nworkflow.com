Connect your Gmail account to the workflow.  \n2. Define the criteria for \"MustRead\" and \"NotNeed\" emails by updating the filter rules in the nodes.  \n3. Activate the workflow to start organizing your inbox.\n\n### **How to customize this workflow to your needs**  \n- Adjust the filters for archiving emails based on your specific preferences.  \n- Modify the sorting rules for \"MustRead\" and \"NotNeed\" categories to match your workflow.  \n- Add additional actions, such as sending notifications for \"MustRead\" emails.",
