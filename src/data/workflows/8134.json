  "description": "\n## Overview  \nThis workflow automatically collects the latest articles from Google News RSS feeds, cleans and deduplicates them, and stores them neatly in a Google Sheet. It runs on a set schedule (every Monday at 09:00 by default) and helps you build a fresh pool of content ideas for newsletters, blogs, or social media.  \n\n---\n\n## What you can do with it  \n- 🔎 **Research faster** – pull in fresh articles from multiple RSS sources without manual searching.  \n- 🧼 **Clean & normalize** – extract the real article URL (instead of Google redirects), keep only the title, summary, and date.  \n- 🗑 **No duplicates** – filter out empty or repeated entries before they ever reach your sheet.  \n- 📊 **Central storage** – append all new, unique links into a Google Sheet for review or further automation.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works  \n1. **Trigger** – Cron starts the flow every Monday at 09:00 (you can change the schedule).  \n2. **RSS Read** – Fetches articles from multiple Google News queries (e.g., “AI”, “AI Automation”).  \n3. **Merge** – Combines all feed results into one list.  \n4. **Set (Clean URL)** – Extracts the real URL, title, summary, and publication date.  \n5. **Filter** – Ensures only items with a valid title and URL continue.  \n6. **Unique by URL** – Removes duplicate articles across feeds.  \n7. **Google Sheets Append** – Saves new links into your chosen Sheet for review and later use.  \n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions  \n1. **Import workflow** into your n8n instance.  \n2. **Update RSS feeds**:  \n   - Replace the example Google News RSS URLs (`AI`, `AI Automation`) with your own queries.  \n   - Format:  \n     ```\n     https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=YOUR_QUERY&hl=de&gl=DE&ceid=DE:de\n     ```  \n3. **Connect Google Sheets**:  \n   - Add your Google Sheets credentials.  \n   - Select the `documentId` (the spreadsheet) and `sheetName` (the tab) in the `Append new Links` node.  \n   - Recommended columns: `date`, `title`, `url`, `summary`.  \n4. **Adjust schedule**:  \n   - In the `Trigger: Montag 09:00` node, change the cron expression to daily or multiple times per day if you want.  \n5. **Run test**:  \n   - Execute once manually.  \n   - Check your sheet for the first rows.  \n\n---\n\n## Tips & Extensions  \n- ✅ Add more RSS Read nodes for additional sources (blogs, media outlets, niche topics).  \n- ✅ Chain this workflow with an AI node (OpenAI/GPT) to automatically generate post ideas from the collected articles.  \n- ✅ Notify yourself in Slack/Telegram when new articles are added.  \n- ✅ Use a status column (`Draft`, `Approved`, `Posted`) to manage a simple content pipeline directly from the sheet.  \n\n---\n\n👉 With this template you’ll never run out of content ideas – everything flows into one place, ready to inspire your next posts, newsletters, or campaigns.  \n",
