  "description": "# Incident Reporting & Management Workflow (Form + Google Sheets + Email)\n\nThis workflow automates incident reporting and management for operations teams by connecting a public reporting form with real-time logging in Google Sheets and instant alert emails to your support team. Whenever an incident is reported via the n8n form/webhook, all details are saved securely and immediately and the right people are notified the moment issues occur. It's a fast, scalable solution for reliable incident handling.\n\n## Who’s It For\n- Renewable energy operators (solar/wind/green energy).\n- Facility and plant managers.\n- Environmental, EHS and safety teams.\n- Technical support and incident response crews.\n- Maintenance & field operations teams.\n- Anyone aiming for compliance-ready, audit-friendly digital issue reporting.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Form Submission**: An n8n-powered form (or webhook endpoint) receives incident reports, capturing all key details: reporter info, contact, location, date/time, type, severity, actions taken, photos and more.\n2. **Log to Google Sheets**: Each report is instantly appended as a new row in a secure Google Sheet, creating a searchable, timestamped audit trail.\n3. **Email Alert (Gmail)**: An automatic email with incident summary and critical details lands in the support team’s inbox seconds after submission—ensuring your response is always prompt.\n4. **Workflow Automation**: These nodes are linked in n8n, enabling no-code/low-code back-end automation for complete visibility and control.\n\n## How to Set Up\n1. **Import Workflow**: In n8n, use \"Import from File\" to upload the workflow JSON provided.\n2. **Edit Configuration**:\n\t- Update form fields as needed (label, validations, options for severity/category).\n\t- Enter your Google Sheet ID and sharing settings.\n\t- Configure Gmail/SMTP credentials and recipient address (example: `supportteam@mailinator.com` or your own team).\n3. **Deploy Webhook**: Copy your n8n webhook URL and connect it to your reporting interface (form, app, device, etc.).\n4. **Activate**: Enable the workflow in n8n. Submissions are now handled in real time.\n5. **Test**: Submit a sample incident to make sure data logs in Google Sheets and the alert email arrives as expected.\n\n## Requirements\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------|\n| n8n Instance | Orchestrates the workflow |\n| Google Account | To access/use Google Sheets |\n| Gmail/SMTP | For sending incident alerts |\n| Incident Source | n8n Form, webhook, app or device|\n\n## How to Customize\n- **Form Fields**: Add/remove fields or validations in the n8n form for organization-specific needs (e.g., add photos, custom categories).\n- **Alert Routing**: Use IF nodes to send critical alerts via Slack, SMS or escalate to on-call teams based on severity/type.\n- **Backend**: Replace Google Sheets with Notion, Airtable, PostgreSQL or other databases.\n- **Reporting**: Add PDF nodes to auto-generate and send report summaries.\n- **Integrations**: Push incidents to ticketing, asset tracking or calendar scheduling workflows.\n\n## Add‑Ons (Optional Extensions)\n| Feature | Description |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Slack Alerts | Instantly notify Slack channels on critical issues |\n| Database Logging | Store reports in SQL/NoSQL systems |\n| PDF Generation | Email ready-to-use incident reports as PDFs |\n| Calendar Events | Schedule follow-ups or deadline reminders |\n| AI Categorization| Auto-classify incidents by severity/type |\n| Task Creation | Open tickets in Jira, Trello, ClickUp or Asana |\n\n## Use Case Examples\n- Field engineers report solar inverter faults with mobile forms.\n- Security personnel log site intrusions, with photos and severity.\n- IoT sensors auto-post equipment failures as incidents.\n- Compliance or EHS teams capture safety observations in real time.\n- Technicians submit maintenance or post-repair issues instantly.\n\n## Common Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Form not triggering | Webhook URL incorrect | Double-check webhook endpoint and method (POST) |\n| Email not delivered | Wrong SMTP/Gmail credentials | Re-enter credentials or verify SMTP access |\n| Google Sheets not updated| Sheets ID wrong/missing permissions | Use correct ID, share sheet with service account or make accessible |\n| Missing report fields in log | Form field names or types mismatched| Align JSON/form data keys with workflow node mappings |\n| Attachments not saved | Field not set for file type | Review form field definitions and adjust as needed |\n\n## Need Help?\nWant a tailored setup, advanced automations or powerful add-ons (AI, SLAs, PDF logs, ticketing integration)?
