Answers pulled from the distilled IdeaBlocks are roughly 40X more accurate, and user searches return the right information about 52% more accurate. In short, Blockify lets you store less data, spend less on computing, and still get better answers- turning huge documents into a concise, high‑quality knowledge base that anyone can search quickly.\n\nBlockify works by processing chunks of text to create structured data from an unstructured data source.\n\nBlockify® replaces the traditional \"dump‑and‑chunk\" approach with an end‑to‑end pipeline that cleans and organizes content before it ever hits a vector store.\n\nAdmins first define who should see what, then the system ingests any file type—Word, PDF, slides, images—inside public cloud, private cloud, or on‑prem. A ​context‑aware splitter finds natural breaks, and a series of specially developed Blockify LLM model turns each segment into a draft IdeaBlock.\n\nGenAI systems fed with this curated data return sharper answers, hallucinate far less, and comply with security policies out of the box.\n\nThe result: higher trust, lower operating cost, and a clear path to enterprise‑scale RAG without the cleanup headaches that stall most AI rollouts.",
