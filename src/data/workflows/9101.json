  "description": "# Lead Qualification & Smart Outreach — Automated Scoring System\n\nAutomate your **lead intake, scoring, and outreach** pipeline.  \nThis workflow collects leads from forms, enriches and scores them using Relevance AI, routes them by quality, and triggers the right follow-up — all without manual busywork.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 What it Does\n- Collects leads from your forms in real-time.\n- Enriches each lead (individual + company) for better context.\n- Scores leads automatically using **Relevance AI** templates.\n- Routes leads into **HOT / WARM / COLD** tiers for prioritization.\n- Drafts or sends personalized outreach emails for each tier.\n- Logs all leads and outcomes into your CRM or Google Sheets.\n- Notifies your team (e.g., via Slack) when a hot lead arrives.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Why Use It\n- **Save time:** stop manually sorting through raw leads.\n- **Focus on the best opportunities:** route only top leads to your sales team.\n- **Personalized outreach:** automated but tailored by lead quality.\n- **Scalable & repeatable:** works for startups, agencies, or larger teams.\n- **Adaptable:** swap CRMs, forms, or email providers easily.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Prerequisites & Setup\nBefore importing or running the workflow, set up these connections:\n\n- **Relevance AI**  \n  Clone the tools (Resources provided in the workflow) for *lead scoring* and *company scoring*, and copy your API key into the HTTP Request nodes.\n\n- **Form Intake**  \n  Use n8n’s built-in form trigger or connect **Typeform, Tally, HubSpot Forms**, or any webhook-based intake.\n\n- **CRM or Database**  \n  Start with **Google Sheets** (included in the sample workflow) or connect **HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, Airtable, Notion**, or any SQL/NoSQL DB.\n\n- **Email Provider**  \n  Use **Gmail** (included), or swap in **Outlook, HubSpot Email, SendGrid, Mailgun**, etc.\n\n- **Team Notifications (Optional)**  \n  Configure **Slack** (or other tools) for instant alerts on hot leads.\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified Flow)\n1. **Lead Intake:** Collects leads from your form or CRM.\n2. **Lead Enrichment:** Uses Relevance AI to score:\n   - **Individual Fit:** role, expertise, influence.\n   - **Company Fit:** size, industry, market relevance.\n3. **Scoring & Insights:** Combines both into a final lead score with labels and notes.\n4. **Routing:** Splits leads into **HOT / WARM / COLD** tiers.\n5. **Outreach:**  \n   - HOT → drafts a review-ready email for your team.  \n   - WARM / COLD → auto-sends appropriate follow-up emails.\n6. **Logging & Alerts:** Saves structured data to your CRM or sheet and notifies your team of hot leads.\n\n---\n\n## 🙋‍♂️ Who is This For\n- **Startups & SaaS teams** that need to prioritize a flood of inbound leads.\n- **Agencies & consultancies** qualifying prospects from ads or webinars.\n- **Small sales teams** that want to spend time only on the best leads.\n- **Freelancers or solopreneurs** who want a lightweight but effective qualification process.\n- **Automation newbies** who want a production-ready system to **sell for 1k-3k**\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Why It Stands Out\n- **Real intelligence:** uses data-driven Relevance AI scoring rather than static rules.\n- **Action-oriented:** routes and triggers the right next step immediately.\n- **Personalized yet scalable:** adapts outreach to each lead tier.\n- **Flexible integrations:** works with most popular CRMs, forms, and email tools.\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Best Practices & Tips\n- Adjust the **weighting** of individual vs. company scores in your Relevance AI template (default: 40% vs 60%).\n- Tune **Router thresholds** (e.g., HOT ≥ 80, WARM 60-79, COLD &lt; 60) to match your sales goals.\n- Add a **human approval step** for high-value deals.\n- Expand with enrichment APIs (e.g., Clearbit, Apollo) for richer lead data.\n- Keep all **API keys private** and out of screenshots or repos.\n\n---\n\n🎉 With this workflow, \n**Sales teams can focus on building relationships — while the system qualifies and organizes leads automatically** \nOR \n**You can sell to sales teams for ~3k**\n\n---\n\n## Note:\nDemo data is pinned in some nodes to help you understand what the data looks like.\nMake sure to unpin those nodes when using for production.",
