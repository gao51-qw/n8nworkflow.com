  "description": "This n8n workflow recommends Taiwan indie music based on a user's city, mood, birthday, today's weather, and star sign. Here's a concise overview:\n\n1. **Trigger**: Starts manually with the \"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\" node.\n2. **Input Setup**: The \"infomation\" node sets user inputs (e.g., city: Taipei, mood: Happy, birthday: 1996/11/21).\n3. **Song Recommendation**: The \"get song recommendation\" node uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to:\n   - Fetch today's weather for the specified city.\n   - Determine the user's zodiac sign from their birthday.\n   - Check the zodiac sign's daily fortune.\n   - Recommend a Taiwan indie song considering weather and fortune.\n   - Explain the song choice and highlight its features.\n   - Return results in JSON format.\n4. **Data Extraction**: The \"Information Extractor\" node parses the JSON output, extracting fields like date, city, weather, zodiac sign, fortune, song, artist, and additional info.\n5. **Spotify Search**: The \"Spotify\" node searches for the recommended song using the artist and song name, retrieving a Spotify URL.\n6. **Final Output**: The \"Final Output\" node compiles all data, including the Spotify link, into a structured format.\n7. **Additional Note**: A \"Sticky Note\" provides context about the workflow's purpose and credits the creator, n8nguide.\n\nThis workflow integrates AI, weather data, astrology, and Spotify to deliver personalized Taiwan indie music recommendations.",
