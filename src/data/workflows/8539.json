  "description": "## What it does\n\nThe job search process is filled with manual, frustrating tasks—reading endless job descriptions only to find the seniority is wrong, the role requires a language you don't speak, or a \"hybrid\" job has an impossible commute.\n\nThis workflow acts as a personal AI assistant that automates the entire top of your job search funnel. It doesn't just find jobs; it reads the full description, checks the commute time from your home, filters by your specific criteria, and even compares the job requirements against your CV to calculate a match score. It's a personalized, decision-making engine that only alerts you to the opportunities that are a perfect fit.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe workflow is designed to be fully customized from a single `Config` node and runs in a multi-layered sequence to find and qualify job opportunities.\n\n1.  **Scrape Jobs:** The workflow triggers and uses **Apify** to find new job postings on LinkedIn based on a list of keywords you define (e.g., \"AI Workflow Engineer,\" \"Automation Specialist\").\n2.  **AI Triage & Smart Filtering:** For each job found, a **Google Gemini** AI performs an initial triage, extracting key data like the job's language, work model (Remote, Hybrid, On-site), and seniority level. The workflow then applies a series of smart filters based on your personal preferences:\n    * **Language & Seniority:** It discards any jobs that don't match your target language and experience level.\n    * **Commute Check:** For hybrid or on-site roles, it uses the **Google Maps API** to calculate the commute time from your home address and filters out any that exceed your maximum desired travel time.\n3.  **AI Deep Analysis vs. CV:** For the handful of jobs that pass the initial filters, a second, more advanced **Google Gemini** agent performs a deep analysis. It compares the job description against your personal CV (which you paste into the config) to generate a summary, a list of key required skills, and a final **match score** (e.g., 8/10).\n4.  **Log & Alert:** The final step is action. The full analysis of every qualified job is logged in a **Supabase** database for your records. However, only jobs with a match score above your set threshold will trigger an immediate, detailed alert in **Telegram**, ensuring you only focus on the best opportunities.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nThis workflow is designed for easy setup, with most personal preferences controlled from a single node.\n\n### Required Credentials\n\n1.  **Apify:** You will need an Apify API Token.\n2.  **Google Cloud:** You will need credentials for a Google Cloud project with the Google AI (Gemini) and Google Maps APIs enabled.\n3.  **Supabase:** You will need your Supabase Project URL and Service Role Key.\n4.  **Telegram:** You will need a Telegram Bot Token and the Chat ID for the channel where you want to receive alerts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Configuration\n\nAlmost all customization is done in the **`Config` node**. Open it and set the following parameters to match your personal job search criteria:\n\n* `MyCV`: Paste the full text of your CV/resume here. This is used by the AI to compare your skills against the job requirements.\n\n* `JobKeywords`: Search keywords for jobs (e.g., \"engineer\", \"product manager\").\n\n* `JobsToScrape`: The maximum number of relevant job postings to scrape in each run.\n\n* `HomeLocation`: Your home city and country (e.g., \"Breda, Netherlands\"). This is used as the starting point for calculating commute times for hybrid or onsite jobs.\n\n* `MaxCommuteMinutes`: Your personal maximum one-way commute time in minutes. The workflow will filter out any jobs that require a longer travel time.\n\n* `TargetLanguage`: Your preferred language for job postings. The workflow will filter out any jobs not written in this language. You can list multiple languages, separated by a comma.\n\n* `ExperienceLevel`: The seniority level you are looking for. The AI will validate this against the job description.\nThe value can be:    \n```\n\"\" → (Any)\n\"internship\" → (Internship)\n\"entry\" → (Entry Level)\n\"associate\" → (Associate)\n\"mid_senior\" → (Mid-Senior Level)\n\"director\" → (Director)\n\"executive\" → (Executive)\n```\n\n* `Under10Applicants`: Set to `true` if you only want to see jobs with fewer than 10 applicants. Set to `false` to see all jobs.\n\nAfter setting up the `Config` node, configure the **Supabase** and **Telegram** nodes with your specific credentials and table/chat details.\n\n## How to Adapt the Template\n\nThis workflow is a powerful framework for any search and qualification process.\n\n* **Change Job Source:** Swap the **Apify** node to scrape different job boards, or use an `RSS Feed Reader` node to get jobs from sites that provide feeds.\n* **Refine AI Logic:** The prompts in the two **Google Gemini** nodes are the core of the engine. You can edit them to extract different data points, change the scoring criteria, or even ask the AI to evaluate a company's culture based on the tone of the job description.\n* **Change the Database:** Replace the **Supabase** node with **Airtable**, **Google Sheets**, or a traditional database node like **Postgres** to log your results.\n* **Modify Alerts:** Change the **Telegram** node to send alerts via **Slack**, **Discord**, or **Email**. You could also add a step to automatically create a draft application or add the job to a personal CRM.",
