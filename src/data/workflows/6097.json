  "description": "## Automated Personalized Email Icebreakers\n\nThis workflow automates creating personalized email icebreakers. It reads leads from a Google Sheet, scrapes their company website, uses OpenAI to analyze the data and craft a unique opening line, and then saves that icebreaker back into the original sheet.\n\n## How It Works\n\n* **Fetch Lead**: The workflow starts, loops through your leads, and pulls one from your Google Sheet.\n* **Scrape & Summarize**: It scrapes the lead's company website and uses a fast OpenAI model to summarize the key points about the company and the person.\n* **Generate Icebreaker**: This summary is then sent to a more powerful OpenAI model, which follows specific instructions to write a short, personalized icebreaker.\n* **Update Sheet**: The new icebreaker is saved back into the correct lead's row in your Google Sheet, using their email to match the record.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* An n8n instance.\n* An OpenAI API key with available credits.\n* A Google account with a Sheet for your leads.\n* The Google Sheet must have columns for lead data (e.g., `Email`, `Website`, `Company Name`) and an empty column named `icebreaker`.\n* The `Email` column must be unique for each lead.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Add Credentials**: In n8n, add your OpenAI API key and connect your Google account via the **Credentials** menu.\n2.  **Configure Google Sheets Nodes**: Select each of the two Google Sheets nodes (`Client data` and `Add icebreaker to sheet`). In each, choose your credential, select your spreadsheet and the specific sheet name, and ensure the column mapping is correct.\n3.  **Configure OpenAI Nodes**: Select both OpenAI nodes (`Summarising prospect data` and `Creating icebreaker`) and choose your OpenAI credential from the dropdown.\n4.  **Verify Update Node**: On the final `Add icebreaker to sheet` node, ensure the **Operation** is set to `Append Or Update` and the **Matching Columns** field is set to `Email`.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options 💡\n\n* **Trigger**: Change the manual start to an automatic trigger, like when a new row is added to the sheet or on a daily schedule (Cron).\n* **AI Prompt**: Modify the prompt in the \"Creating icebreaker\" node to change the tone, style, or length of the output.\n* **AI Model**: Experiment with different OpenAI models (like `gpt-4o`) for a different balance of cost, speed, and quality.\n* **Data Source**: Replace Google Sheets with a CRM like HubSpot or a database like Postgres.",
