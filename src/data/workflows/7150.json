  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n**Alternatively, you can delete the community node and use the HTTP node instead.\n**\nMost email agent templates are fundamentally broken. They're stateless—they have no long-term memory. An agent that can't remember past conversations is just a glorified auto-responder, not an intelligent system.\n\nThis workflow is Part 1 of building a truly agentic system: creating the brain.\n\nBefore you can have an agent that replies intelligently, you need a knowledge base for it to draw from. This system uses a sophisticated parser to automatically read, analyze, and structure every incoming email. It then logs that intelligence into a persistent, long-term memory powered by mem0.\n\n\n### The Problem This Solves\n\nYour inbox is a goldmine of client data, but it's unstructured, and manually monitoring it is a full-time job. This constant, reactive work prevents you from scaling. This workflow solves that \"system problem\" by creating an \"always-on\" engine that automatically processes, analyzes, and structures every incoming email, turning raw communication into a single source of truth for growth.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\nThis is an autonomous, multi-stage intelligence engine. It runs in the background, turning every new email into a valuable data asset.\n\n1.  **Real-Time Ingest & Prep:** The system is kicked off by the **Gmail Trigger**, which constantly watches your inbox. The moment a new email arrives, the workflow fires. That email is immediately passed to the **Set Target Email** node, which strips it down to the essentials: the sender's address, the subject, and the core text of the message (I prefer using the plain text or HTML-as-text for reliability). While this step is optional, it's a good practice for keeping the data clean and orderly for the AI.\n\n2.  **AI Analysis (The Brain):** The prepared text is fed to the core of the system: the **AI Agent**. This agent, powered by the **LLM of your choice** (e.g., GPT-4), reads and understands the email's content. It's not just reading; it's performing analysis to:\n    * Extract the core message.\n    * Determine the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).\n    * Identify potential red flags.\n    * Pull out key topics and keywords.\n    * The agent uses **Window Buffer Memory** to recall the last 10 messages within the same conversation thread, giving it the context to provide a much smarter analysis.\n\n3.  **Quality Control (The Parser):** We don't trust the AI's first draft blindly. The analysis is sent to an **Auto-fixing Output Parser**. If the initial output isn't in a perfect JSON format, a second **Parsing LLM** (e.g., Mistral) automatically corrects it. This is our \"twist\" that guarantees your data is always perfectly structured and reliable.\n\n4.  **Create a Permanent Client Record:** This is the most critical step. The clean, structured data is sent to **mem0**. The analysis is now logged against the **sender's email address**. This moves beyond just tracking conversations; it builds a complete, historical intelligence file on every person you communicate with, creating an invaluable, long-term asset.\n\n**Optional Use:** For back-filling historical data, you can disable the Gmail Trigger and temporarily connect a **Gmail \"Get Many\"** node to the `Set Target Email` node to process your backlog in batches.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Requirements\n\nTo deploy this system, you'll need the following:\n* An active **n8n** instance.\n* **Gmail** API credentials.\n* An API key for your primary LLM (e.g., **OpenAI**).\n* An API key for your parsing LLM (e.g., **Mistral AI**).\n* An account with **mem0.ai** for the memory layer.\n",
