  "description": "## 📖 Description  \n\n### 🔹 How it works  \nThis workflow uses **AI (Mistral LLM + Pollinations.ai)** to generate **high-quality visual content for social media campaigns**. It automates the process from **brand/campaign input** to **final image upload**, ensuring consistency and relevance.\n\n1. **Input Brand & Campaign Data**  \n   - Retrieves brand profile and campaign goals from Google Drive.  \n   - Cleans and merges the data into a structured JSON format.  \n\n2. **Campaign Goal Generation**  \n   - AI summarizes campaign goals, audience, success metrics, and keywords.  \n   - Produces a clear **campaign goal summary** for content planning.  \n\n3. **Image Prompt Generation**  \n   - AI creates **5 detailed image prompts** reflecting the campaign story.  \n   - Includes **1 caption** and **4–6 relevant hashtags**.  \n\n4. **Image Creation**  \n   - Pollinations.ai generates images based on the AI prompts.  \n   - Each image is renamed systematically (photo1 → photo5).  \n\n5. **Post-Processing & Upload**  \n   - All images are merged into a single item.  \n   - Workflow uploads the final output to Google Drive for campaign use.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Set up steps  \n\n1. **Connect Credentials**  \n   - Add Google Drive and Mistral API credentials in n8n.  \n\n2. **Configure Google Drive Input Nodes**  \n   - Set `fileId` for brand profile and campaign goals.  \n\n3. **Customize AI Prompts**  \n   - Sticky notes explain AI nodes for goal summary and image prompt generation.  \n   - Optionally modify tone, keywords, or target audience for brand-specific campaigns.  \n\n4. **Check Image Output Nodes**  \n   - Ensure Pollinations.ai HTTP request nodes are active.  \n   - Verify renaming code nodes for proper photo sequence.  \n\n5. **Activate Workflow**  \n   - Test workflow manually to ensure images are generated and uploaded correctly.  \n\n---\n## 🔹 Data Handling & Output  \n\n- This workflow **pulls brand profile and campaign goal data** from Google Drive.  \n- Data is processed into **structured JSON**, including:  \n  - **Brand Profile**: name, mission, vision, values, services, tone, keywords, contact info.  \n  - **Campaign Goal**: primary goal, focus, success metrics, target audience, core message.  \n- Supports **population of multiple campaigns or brands** dynamically.  \n- JSON output can be used downstream for **image prompt generation, reporting, or analytics**.  \n- All processing is **automated**, with clear nodes for extraction, parsing, and merging.  \n\n---\n\n**[pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/)** is an open-source  free text and image generation API available.  No signups or API keys required. which  prioritize your privacy with zero data storage and completely anonymous usage.\n\n---\n\n\n⚡ **Result:** A fully automated **AI-to-image workflow** that transforms campaign goals into ready-to-use social media visuals, saving time and maintaining brand consistency.",
