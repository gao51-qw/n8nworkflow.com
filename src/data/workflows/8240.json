High-budget leads are enriched in HubSpot as contacts with detailed properties, and a priority task is created for the sales team. Leads are then routed based on their source (Facebook or SurveyMonkey), logged into Google Sheets for marketing or campaign tracking, and finally, a Slack notification is sent to alert the team in real time.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**Capture & Qualify Leads**\n\n- The workflow triggers on new Typeform submissions.\n\n- It evaluates the budget field to identify high-priority leads (&gt;$5,000).\n\n**CRM Enrichment**\n\n- High-priority leads are automatically created or updated as contacts in HubSpot.\n\n- A priority follow-up task is logged in HubSpot with the lead’s budget details.\n\n**Source-Based Routing**\n\n- If the lead comes from Facebook or SurveyMonkey, their details are logged in a Google Sheet.\n\n- This ensures marketing and campaign teams can analyze and track leads separately.\n\n**Team Notifications**\n\n- Once logged, the workflow sends a Slack message to the sales/marketing channel.\n\n- The message includes the lead’s name, email, phone, budget, and source, ensuring instant visibility for follow-up.\n\n## Why use this?\n\n- Automatically qualifies high-value leads based on budget.\n\n- Syncs lead details seamlessly with HubSpot CRM.\n\n- Routes leads by source for better campaign tracking.\n\n- Keeps sales and marketing teams aligned with real-time Slack alerts.\n\n- Cuts down manual effort, ensuring faster response times and higher conversion rates.",
