  "description": "## ✨ Automate Daily Hindu Festival Posts on X (Twitter) with AI 🐦\n\nThis workflow automates the entire process of creating and publishing culturally rich social media content about Hindu festivals. It starts by building a comprehensive festival calendar for the year in a Google Sheet, then runs daily to post engaging, bilingual updates on X (formerly Twitter). 🗓️\n\nThe workflow uses a sophisticated dual-AI system: **Google Gemini** acts as a content generator creating multiple post options ✍️, while **OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini** acts as a discerning social media manager, selecting the very best post for publication. 🧠 This ensures your content is not only automated but also high-quality and optimized for engagement.\n\n### How it works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow operates in two distinct stages:\n\n**Part 1: Data Population (One-Time Manual Run)**\n\n1.  **🔍 Fetch Festival Data:** Manually trigger the workflow to scrape a list of 2025 Hindu festivals from a public calendar using the [Jina AI Reader API](https://jina.ai/reader/).\n2.  **✨ Enrich with AI:** For each festival, a **Google Gemini** model researches and extracts key details:\n      * The festival's name in Hindi.\n      * A concise description of its significance in English.\n      * A Hindi translation of the description.\n3.  **📝 Store in Google Sheets:** The enriched data for the entire year is then systematically organized and saved in a designated Google Sheet, creating a content calendar.\n\n**Part 2: Daily Automated Posting**\n\n1.  **⏰ Daily Trigger:** A Schedule Trigger node activates the workflow every morning at 8 AM.\n2.  **✔️ Check for Festivals:** The workflow gets today's date and checks the Google Sheet to see if there is a corresponding festival.\n3.  **🎨 Generate Post Options:** If a festival is scheduled for the day, **Google Gemini** generates three distinct and engaging post options for X. Each post is crafted to be concise, use a mix of English and Hindi, and include relevant emojis and hashtags.\n4.  **🏆 Select the Best Post:** **OpenAI's GPT-4o Mini** then evaluates the three generated posts based on criteria like clarity, engagement potential, and effective use of language. It selects the single most impactful post.\n5.  **🚀 Publish to X:** The winning post is automatically published to your connected X account.\n\n### Features ⭐\n\n  * **🤖 Fully Automated Content Pipeline:** From data collection to final publication, no manual intervention is needed after the initial setup.\n  * **🧠 Dual-AI System:** Leverages Google Gemini for creative generation and OpenAI GPT-4o Mini for critical selection, ensuring high-quality output.\n  * **🗣️ Bilingual Content:** Creates posts that blend English and Hindi to enhance cultural connection and broaden audience reach.\n  * **🎯 Dynamic and Contextual:** Posts are automatically tailored to the specific festival of the day.\n  * **🗓️ Centralized Content Calendar:** Uses Google Sheets as a reliable, easy-to-manage database for your yearly social media plan.\n\n### Prerequisites 🛠️\n\nBefore you can use this workflow, you will need to:\n\n  * Have an [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance set up.\n  * Create a new, empty **Google Sheet**.\n  * Obtain credentials for the following services:\n      * **Jina AI:** Get a free Bearer Token from the [Jina AI API page](https://jina.ai/reader/).\n      * **Google:** Set up [Google credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/google/) (OAuth2) for the Google Sheets and Google Gemini nodes.\n      * **OpenAI:** Get an API key from your [OpenAI Platform dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n      * **X (Twitter):** Set up [X credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/twitter/) (OAuth2) to allow n8n to post on your behalf.\n\n### How to use this template 🚀\n\n1.  **🔑 Set up Credentials:**\n      * In n8n, go to the \"Credentials\" section and add new credentials for Jina AI, Google (for both Sheets and Gemini), OpenAI, and X using the API keys and tokens you obtained.\n2.  **📊 Configure the Google Sheet:**\n      * Create a new Google Sheet. In the first row, create the following headers exactly as written:\n          * `Name of the Festival`\n          * `Date`\n          * ` English Description  ` (Note the trailing space)\n          * `Hindi Description`\n      * Open the **\"Add all Rows at once\"** and **\"Fetch Data of Matched Date\"** nodes in the workflow and connect them to your Google account and select the Sheet you just created.\n3.  **▶️ Populate the Data (Manual Step):**\n      * Click the **\"Execute workflow\"** button on the `When clicking ‘Execute workflow’` node. This will run the first part of the workflow, filling your Google Sheet with festival data for 2025. This only needs to be done once.\n4.  **✅ Activate the Workflow:**\n      * Save the workflow and then activate it using the toggle at the top right of the n8n canvas.\n      * The workflow will now run automatically every day to post about the day's festival.\n\n### Extending the Workflow 💡\n\n  * **🖼️ Add Image Generation:** Integrate a node like DALL-E or Midjourney to generate a unique image for each festival and include it in the tweet.\n  * **🌐 Cross-Platform Posting:** Duplicate the final \"Post to X\" node and adapt it to post on other platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Telegram.\n  * **🎨 Change the Tone:** Modify the prompts in the **\"Generate Posts\"** and **\"Select Best Post\"** nodes to change the style of your social media content—make it more formal, humorous, or poetic.\n  * **📅 Use a Different Year:** Update the URL in the **\"Get Festival Data\"** node to fetch data for a different year.
