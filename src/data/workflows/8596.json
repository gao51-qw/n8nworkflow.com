  "description": "![Captura de pantalla 20250916 a las 17.31.18.png](fileId:2640)\nThis automated workflow template helps agencies and social media managers **securely onboard clients** by generating a branded **Connect Accounts** page where clients can link their social profiles **without sharing passwords**. The flow creates a user in Upload-Post and returns a **one-hour magic link** you can send to the client. Once connected, you can publish from the Upload-Post dashboard, via API, or from your own n8n automations using the created profile name.\n\n***Note:*** This workflow uses the **Upload-Post.com** API to create the user and generate a time-limited JWT connect link. You can brand the connect page with your logo via the `logoImage` parameter (and optionally `brandName`, `redirectUrl`, or `allowedPlatforms`).\n\n## Who Is This For?\n- **Marketing & Creative Agencies:** Onboard new clients quickly and securely without requesting credentials.\n- **Social Media Managers & Freelancers:** Standardize account connection across all clients in one simple step.\n- **SaaS & No-Code Builders:** Offer a white-label “connect your socials” experience inside your tools and client portals.\n- **In-House Marketing Teams:** Let internal stakeholders connect brand accounts without IT hand-offs.\n\n## Why This Matters\nCollecting passwords is risky, slow, and non-compliant. Onboarding often means back-and-forth emails, shared logins, and manual setup. This template:\n- **Eliminates Password Sharing:** Clients connect through secure OAuth flows.\n- **Reduces Friction:** A single, short-lived link guides clients to connect supported platforms.\n- **Speeds Activation:** As soon as accounts are linked, you can publish from the dashboard, API, or n8n.\n- **Builds Trust & Compliance:** Brandable, auditable, and privacy-first onboarding.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Trigger:** Start the workflow in n8n.\n2. **Create User:** The **Create user** node provisions a client user in **Upload-Post** (use a unique handle/slug).\n3. **Generate Connect Link:** The **Generate JWT for platform integration** node returns a **one-hour connect URL** (plus metadata), brandable via `logoImage`.\n4. **Share With Client:** Send the link via your preferred channel (Email/Telegram/Slack/CRM).\n5. **Client Connects Accounts:** The client links their social profiles on the secure page—no passwords required.\n6. **Start Publishing:** Post from **https://app.upload-post.com/dashboard**, the **Upload-Post API**, or your **n8n flows** referencing the created profile name.\n\n## Setup\n1. **Upload-Post Account & Credentials**  \n   Create an account at **upload-post.com** and add your API credentials in n8n.\n2. **Configure Nodes**  \n   - **Create user:** Set `newUser` to a unique identifier (e.g., client email/slug).  \n   - **Generate JWT:** Set `user` to the same identifier and (optionally) `logoImage` to a public logo URL. You can also pass `brandName`, `redirectUrl`, and `allowedPlatforms`.\n3. **Branding (Optional)**  \n   Use a square transparent PNG for best results on the connect page.\n4. **Delivery (Optional)**  \n   Add Email/Telegram/Slack nodes to automatically send the connect link to the client and log the action in your CRM.\n\n## Requirements\n- **Accounts:** n8n, Upload-Post.com  \n- **API Keys/Creds:** Upload-Post API credentials  \n- **Social Media:** Clients must have the social accounts they want to connect\n\n## Features\n- **Secure Client Onboarding:** One-click, **no-password** account linking via OAuth.\n- **Time-Limited Access:** **One-hour** magic link for safer sharing and compliance.\n- **Brandable Experience:** Show your own branding on the connect page with `logoImage` (plus `brandName`).\n- **Ready to Publish:** Post immediately from the dashboard, API, or n8n using the profile name.\n- **Scales With You:** Reuse the template for every client and integrate with your CRM and comms tools.\n- **Multi-Platform Support:** Works with all social platforms supported by Upload-Post (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, X, Threads, LinkedIn, Pinterest).\n\nUse this template to onboard clients in minutes and start publishing securely—without ever asking for a password.\n",
