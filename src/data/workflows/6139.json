  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## Overview\nThis workflow automates the process of transcribing audio files and summarizing them using OpenAI models, with the final output stored neatly in Notion. Whether you're a researcher, content creator, student, or professional, this automation saves time by converting voice recordings into actionable summaries with zero manual effort.\n\nCreated by: **Abdullah Dilshad**\nContact: **iamabdullahdilshad@gmail.com**\n\n## Who It’s For\nThis template is ideal for:\n- **Researchers**: Transcribe and summarize interviews, lectures, or research recordings.\n- **Content Creators**: Convert podcasts or videos into transcripts and social captions/show notes.\n- **Students**: Automatically turn lectures or study group audio into summarized notes.\n- **Professionals**: Log meeting notes and summaries directly into your Notion workspace.\n\n## How It Works\nThis four-step workflow performs the following:\n\n- **Step 1:** **Trigger: New Audio in Google Drive**\nAutomatically triggers when a new audio file (MP3/WAV) is uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder.The file is then downloaded for processing.\n\n- **Step 2: Transcribe Audio with Whisper**\nThe audio file is sent to OpenAI’s Whisper model for high-accuracy transcription.\n\n- **Step 3: Summarize Transcript with GPT-4**\nThe transcript is passed to GPT-4, which generates a clean, concise summary.\n\n- **Step 4: Store Summary in Notion**\nA new Notion page is created with the generated summary and optional metadata (file name, upload time, etc.).\n\n## Setup Instructions\n- **Step 1: Google Drive Trigger**\nConnect your Google Drive account.\nSelect the folder you want to monitor.\nThis node detects new file uploads and passes the file for download.\n\n- **Step 2: Download File**\nDownloads the new audio file for transcription.\nStep 3: Transcribe Recording (OpenAI Whisper)\nConnect your OpenAI API Key.\nEnsure this node receives the binary audio file.\nIt will return the transcription as plain text.\n\n- **Step 3: Transcribe Recording (OpenAI Whisper)**\nConnect your OpenAI API Key.\nEnsure this node receives the binary audio file.\nIt will return the transcription as plain text.\n\n- **Step 4: Summarize Transcript (GPT-4 via AI Agent)**\nUse your OpenAI API Key.\nConfigure a summarization prompt like:\n\"Summarize the following transcript in a clear and concise manner:\"\nConnect the output from Whisper into this GPT-4 prompt.\n\n- **Step 5: Notion Integration**\nConnect your Notion account.\nChoose or create a database to store summaries.\nMap the GPT output (summary) to a \"Text\" or \"Rich Text\" property.\nOptionally include metadata like filename, file upload date, etc.",
