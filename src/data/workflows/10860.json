  "description": "## Automated Video Generation, Google Drive Upload, and Email Notification with Veo 3 Fast API\n\n\nThis workflow automates the process of generating videos using the [Veo 3 Fast API](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/veo-3-fast), uploading the video to Google Drive, and notifying the user via email. All tasks are executed seamlessly, ensuring a smooth user experience with automatic error handling.\n\n## Node-by-Node Explanation\n1. **On Form Submission**: Triggers the workflow when a user submits a form with a prompt.\n2. **Veo 3 Fast API Processor**: Sends the user's prompt to the [Veo 3 Fast API](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/veo-3-fast) to generate a video.\n3. **Wait for API Response**: Pauses the workflow for 35 seconds to allow the API response.\n4. **API Request: Check Task Status**: Sends a request to check the status of the video generation task.\n5. **Condition: Task Output Status**: Evaluates whether the task was successful, still processing, or failed.\n6. **Wait for Task to Complete**: Pauses the workflow for 30 seconds to recheck the task status if processing is ongoing.\n7. **Send Email: API Error - Task Failed**: Sends an email if the task fails to generate the video.\n8. **Send Email: API Error - Task ID Missing**: Sends an email if the task ID is missing in the response.\n9. **Download Video**: Downloads the processed video from the provided output URL.\n10. **Upload File to Google Drive**: Uploads the processed video to the user's Google Drive.\n11. **Set Google Drive Permissions**: Sets the necessary sharing permissions for the uploaded video.\n12. **Send an Email: Video Link**: Sends an email with the link to the uploaded video.\n\n## How to Obtain a RapidAPI Key\n1. Go to [Veo 3 Fast on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/veo-3-fast).\n2. Create an account or log in.\n3. Subscribe to the API plan that suits your needs.\n4. After subscription, find your **API Key** in the \"Keys & Access\" section.\n\n## How to Configure Google Drive API\n1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one.\n3. Enable the **Google Drive API** for the project.\n4. Go to **Credentials** and create OAuth 2.0 credentials.\n5. Add the credentials to your n8n Google Drive node for seamless access to your Google Drive.\n\n## Use Case\n- **Use Case**: A content creation team can automate the video production process, upload videos to Google Drive, and share them with stakeholders instantly after the task is complete.\n\n## Benefits\n- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual tasks, saving time and effort by automating video creation and file management.\n- **Error Handling**: Sends notifications for task failures or missing data, ensuring quick resolutions.\n- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically uploads files to Google Drive and shares the link with users, streamlining the workflow.\n\n## Who Is This For\n- **Content Creators**: Automates video creation and file management.\n- **Marketing Teams**: Quick and easy video generation for campaigns.\n- **Developers**: Can integrate with APIs and automate tasks.\n- **Business Teams**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks like file uploads and email notifications.\n",
