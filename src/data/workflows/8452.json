  "description": "## Who's it for\nMarketing teams, business intelligence professionals, competitive analysts, and executives who need consistent industry monitoring with AI-powered analysis and automated team distribution via Discord.\n## What it does\nThis intelligent workflow automatically monitors multiple industry topics, scrapes and analyzes relevant news articles using Claude AI, and delivers professionally formatted intelligence reports to your Discord channel. The system provides weekly automated monitoring cycles with personalized bot communication and comprehensive content analysis.\n## How it works\nThe workflow follows a sophisticated 7-phase automation process:\nScheduled Activation: Triggers weekly monitoring cycles (default: Mondays at 9 AM)\nQuery Management: Retrieves monitoring topics from centralized Google Sheets configuration\nNews Discovery: Executes comprehensive Google News searches using SerpAPI for each configured topic\nContent Extraction: Scrapes full article content from top 3 sources per topic using Firecrawl\nAI Analysis: Processes scraped content using Claude 4 Sonnet for intelligent synthesis and formatting\nDiscord Optimization: Automatically segments content to comply with Discord's 2000-character message limits\nAutomated Delivery: Posts formatted intelligence reports to Discord channel with branded \"Claptrap\" bot personality\n## Requirements\n\nGoogle Sheets account for query management\nSerpAPI account for Google News access\nFirecrawl account for article content extraction\nAnthropic API access for Claude 4 Sonnet\nDiscord bot with proper channel permissions\nScheduled execution capability (cron-based trigger)\n\n## How to set up\n### Step 1: Configure Google Sheets query management\nCreate monitoring sheet: Set up Google Sheets document with \"Query\" sheet\nAdd search topics: Include industry keywords, competitor names, and relevant search terms\nSheet structure: Simple column format with \"Query\" header containing search terms\nAccess permissions: Ensure n8n has read access to the Google Sheets document\n### Step 2: Configure API credentials\nSet up the following credentials in n8n:\nGoogle Sheets OAuth2: For accessing query configuration sheet\nSerpAPI: For Google News search functionality with proper rate limits\nFirecrawl API: For reliable article content extraction across various websites\nAnthropic API: For Claude 4 Sonnet access with sufficient token limits\nDiscord Bot API: With message posting permissions in target channel\n### Step 3: Customize scheduling settings\nCron expression: Default set to \"0 9 * * 1\" (Mondays at 9 AM)\nFrequency options: Adjust for daily, weekly, or custom monitoring cycles\nTimezone considerations: Configure according to team's working hours\nExecution timing: Ensure adequate processing time for multiple topics\n### Step 4: Configure Discord integration\nSet up Discord delivery settings:\nGuild ID: Target Discord server (currently: 919951151888236595)\nChannel ID: Specific monitoring channel (currently: 1334455789284364309)\nBot permissions: Message posting, embed suppression capabilities\nBrand personality: Customize \"Claptrap\" bot messaging style and tone\n### Step 5: Customize content analysis\nConfigure AI analysis parameters:\nAnalysis depth: Currently processes top 3 articles per topic\nContent format: Structured markdown format with consistent styling\nLanguage settings: Currently configured for French output (easily customizable)\nQuality controls: Error handling for inaccessible articles and content\n## How to customize the workflow\n### Query management expansion\nTopic categories: Organize queries by industry, competitor, or strategic focus areas\nKeyword optimization: Refine search terms based on result quality and relevance\nDynamic queries: Implement time-based or event-triggered query modifications\nMulti-language support: Add international keyword variations for global monitoring\n### Advanced content processing\nArticle quantity: Modify from 3 to more articles per topic based on analysis needs\nContent filtering: Add quality scoring and relevance filtering for article selection\nSource preferences: Implement preferred publisher lists or source quality weighting\nContent enrichment: Add sentiment analysis, trend identification, or competitive positioning\n### Discord delivery enhancements\nRich formatting: Implement Discord embeds, reactions, or interactive elements\nMulti-channel distribution: Route different topics to specialized Discord channels\nAlert levels: Add priority-based messaging for urgent industry developments\nArchive functionality: Create searchable message threads or database storage\n### Integration expansions\nSlack compatibility: Replace or supplement Discord with Slack notifications\nEmail reports: Add formatted email distribution for executive summaries\nDatabase storage: Implement persistent storage for historical analysis and trending\nAPI endpoints: Create webhook endpoints for third-party system integration\n### AI analysis customization\nAnalysis templates: Create topic-specific analysis frameworks and formatting\nCompetitive focus: Enhance competitor mention detection and analysis depth\nTrend identification: Implement cross-topic trend analysis and strategic insights\nSummary levels: Create executive summaries alongside detailed technical analysis\n## Advanced monitoring features\n### Intelligent content curation\nThe system provides sophisticated content management:\nRelevance scoring: Automatic ranking of articles by topic relevance and publication authority\nDuplicate detection: Prevents redundant coverage of the same story across different sources\nContent quality assessment: Filters low-quality or promotional content automatically\nSource diversity: Ensures coverage from multiple perspectives and publication types\n### Error handling and reliability\nGraceful degradation: Continues processing even if individual articles fail to scrape\nRetry mechanisms: Automatic retry logic for temporary API failures or network issues\nContent fallbacks: Uses article snippets when full content extraction fails\nNotification continuity: Ensures Discord delivery even with partial content processing\n## Results interpretation\n### Intelligence report structure\nEach monitoring cycle delivers:\nTopic-specific summaries: Individual analysis for each configured search query\nSource attribution: Complete citation with publication date, source, and URL\nStructured formatting: Consistent presentation optimized for quick scanning\nProfessional analysis: AI-generated insights maintaining factual accuracy and business context\n### Performance analytics\nMonitor system effectiveness through:\nProcessing metrics: Track successful article extraction and analysis rates\nContent quality: Assess relevance and usefulness of delivered intelligence\nTeam engagement: Monitor Discord channel activity and report utilization\nSystem reliability: Track execution success rates and error patterns\n## Use cases\n### Competitive intelligence\nMarket monitoring: Track competitor announcements, product launches, and strategic moves\nIndustry trends: Identify emerging technologies, regulatory changes, and market shifts\nPartnership tracking: Monitor alliance formations, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships\nLeadership changes: Track executive movements and organizational restructuring\n### Strategic planning support\nMarket research: Continuous intelligence gathering for strategic decision-making\nRisk assessment: Early warning system for industry disruptions and regulatory changes\nOpportunity identification: Spot emerging markets, technologies, and business opportunities\nBrand monitoring: Track industry perception and competitive positioning\n### Team collaboration enhancement\nKnowledge sharing: Centralized distribution of relevant industry intelligence\nDiscussion facilitation: Provide common information baseline for strategic discussions\nDecision support: Deliver timely intelligence for business planning and strategy sessions\nCompetitive awareness: Keep teams informed about competitive landscape changes\n## Workflow limitations\nLanguage dependency: Currently optimized for French analysis output (easily customizable)\nProcessing capacity: Limited to 3 articles per query (configurable based on API limits)\nPlatform specificity: Configured for Discord delivery (adaptable to other platforms)\nScheduling constraints: Fixed weekly schedule (customizable via cron expressions)\nContent access: Dependent on article accessibility and website compatibility with Firecrawl\nAPI dependencies: Requires active subscriptions and proper rate limit management for all integrated services",
