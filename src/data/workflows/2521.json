A final form ending indicates if that action succeeded or not.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those\n- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node\n    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.\n\n## How to use\n\n- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node\n- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n- Please note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the Execute Command Node.\n- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.\n- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments. For production use consider the n8n enterprise edition which provides a **reliable** way to manage credentials across different environments.",
