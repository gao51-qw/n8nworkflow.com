  "description": "🔧 Automated Workflow: Scrape Travel Agent Contacts and Send Personalized Survey Emails\nThis workflow is designed to automate the process of scraping travel agent contact data, standardizing the information, storing it, and then sending out personalized survey emails using AI. It’s especially useful for outreach campaigns, research, or lead generation.\n\n⚙️ Workflow Breakdown\n📍 Part 1: Scraping and Storing Travel Agent Data\n1. HTTP Scrape Website\nType: HTTP Request (POST)\n\nFunction: Calls a third-party scraping API (https://api.firecrawl.dev...) to scrape data from a travel agent listing site.\n\nPurpose: Extract raw HTML or structured data from a website containing contact info.\n\n2. OpenAI Standardise Data\nType: OpenAI Message Model\n\nFunction: Uses AI to clean and standardize the raw scraped data into structured JSON (e.g., name, email, agency, location).\n\nPurpose: Ensures uniformity in formatting, making data easier to process downstream.\n\n3. Split Out\nType: Item Splitter\n\nFunction: Splits the standardized array of agent records into individual items.\n\nPurpose: Allows appending each agent as a separate row in Google Sheets.\n\n4. Google Sheet - Data Store\nType: Google Sheets (Append)\n\nFunction: Stores each individual record in a spreadsheet.\n\nPurpose: Maintains a centralized and accessible log of scraped and processed contacts.\n\n📍 Part 2: Read Records and Send Personalized Survey Emails\nTriggered Manually – when “Test Workflow” button is clicked.\n\n1. Trigger – When clicking 'Test workflow'\nType: Manual Trigger\n\nFunction: Starts the second part of the workflow manually.\n\nUse Case: Testing or running the outreach email process on demand.\n\n2. Google Sheet Data Store (Read)\nType: Google Sheets (Read)\n\nFunction: Reads the stored travel agent records from the spreadsheet.\n\nPurpose: Retrieves contact details and context for personalized messaging.\n\n3. OpenAI Mail Composer\nType: OpenAI Message Model\n\nFunction: Generates a custom email for each agent using their details.\n\nPurpose: Creates human-like, engaging emails that include a survey link (optional input).\n\n4. Google Sheet Update Records\nType: Google Sheets (Update)\n\nFunction: Optionally marks the record as \"emailed\" or logs the date of outreach.\n\nPurpose: Prevents duplicate outreach and helps track campaign status.\n\n5. Send Email\nType: Email Node (SMTP or integrated service)\n\nFunction: Sends the personalized email generated by OpenAI.\n\nPurpose: Delivers the survey to each travel agent with contextually relevant messaging.\n\n🧠 Use Case:\nTargeted email outreach to travel agents.\n\nCollect insights or feedback via survey links.\n\nUse personalized messaging to improve response rates.\n\n📌 Benefits:\n✅ Fully automated scraping and processing.\n\n✅ Personalized at scale using OpenAI.\n\n✅ Easily repeatable for different domains or campaigns.\n\n✅ Centralized recordkeeping in Google Sheets.\n\n🛠️ Tech Stack:\nn8n: Automation and workflow management\n\nOpenAI: AI-based text standardization and email generation\n\nFirecrawl (or similar): Web scraping API\n\nGoogle Sheets: Data storage and tracking\n\nEmail Node: Survey email delivery\n\n",
