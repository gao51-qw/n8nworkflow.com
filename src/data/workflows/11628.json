  "description": "## **Who’s it for**\nThis workflow is built for B2B SaaS and CX teams that are drowning in unstructured customer feedback across tools. It’s ideal for Customer Success, Product and Support leaders who want a light “voice of customer engine” without rebuilding their stack: Gmail for interactions, Slack for conversations, Pipedrive for notes and Zendesk for tickets, plus Notion for follow-up tasks. \n\n## **How it works / What it does**\nThe workflow runs on a schedule or manual trigger and first sets the CSM’s email address. It then uses an AI “Data agent” to pull recent customer signals from multiple sources: Gmail messages, Slack messages, Pipedrive notes and Zendesk tickets.\nA “Signals agent” compresses each piece of feedback into a concise, neutral summary, which is then grouped by topic via a “Clustering agent”. Each cluster gets a label, count and examples.\nFinally, an “Action agent” routes clusters based on their label:\n- Create Zendesk tickets for product/performance issues\n- Post to a dedicated Slack channel for billing / contract topics\n- Create Notion tasks for sales-related feedback\n- Send targeted Gmail messages to the CSM for high-risk or engagement-related items\n## **How to set up**\n1. Import the workflow into n8n.\n2. Connect credentials for Gmail, Slack, Pipedrive, Zendesk, Notion and OpenAI.\n3. Update the CSM email in the “Set CSM email” node.\n4. Adjust date filters, send-to addresses and Slack channel IDs as needed.\n5. Enable the schedule trigger for weekly or daily digests.\n## **Requirements**\n- Active accounts & credentials for: Gmail, Slack, Pipedrive, Zendesk and Notion\n- OpenAI (or compatible) API key for the LLM node\n- At least one Slack channel for posting feedback (e.g. #billing-feedback)\n## **How to customize the workflow**\n- Change the time window or filters (sender, channel, query) for each data source.\n- Edit the clustering and routing prompts to match your own categories and teams.\n- Add new destinations (e.g. Jira, HubSpot) by connecting more tools to the Action agent.\n- Modify thresholds (e.g. minimum count) before a cluster triggers an action.\n- Localize labels and email copy to your team’s language and tone.",
