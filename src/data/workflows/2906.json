  "description": "This n8n automation is designed to analyze cryptocurrency trends by extracting, processing, and interpreting candlestick charts using AI-powered agents. The workflow enhances technical analysis by integrating real-time market data, ensuring traders receive accurate and actionable insights.\n\n[![Video Thumbnail](https://ailistmaster.com/sites/default/files/2025-02/maxresdefault-min.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW03ztGgbg0)\n\n## Workflow Breakdown:\n\n🔹 1. **Chat Node – Provide Crypto Information**\nUsers enter a crypto symbol in the required format (EXCHANGE:SYMBOL), such as BINANCE:BTCUSDT. This ensures the workflow retrieves the correct market data.\n\n🔹 **Retrieve Daily Candlestick Chart**\nOnce the input is received, the workflow fetches the full-day candlestick chart for the selected crypto, providing a macro-level market trend.\n\n🔹 **AI Agent – Analyze Daily Chart**\nThe first AI agent, powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenRouter, analyzes the daily candlestick pattern to detect trends and potential market signals.\n\n🔹 **Fetch 5-Minute Candlestick Chart**\nTo refine the analysis, the workflow retrieves a 5-minute interval candlestick chart, allowing for real-time market movement evaluation.\n\n🔹 **AI Agent – Advanced Candlestick Analysis**\nThis AI agent combines the 5-minute chart with the daily analysis to provide an in-depth market prediction. Here’s where the real magic happens—AI interprets short-term trends in the context of long-term movements.\n\n🔹 **Shared Windows Buffer – Store Intermediate Results**\nThe Windows Buffer temporarily stores analysis results, ensuring seamless data flow between AI agents for a more structured interpretation.\n\n🔹 **Serp API – Retrieve Crypto News**\nTo add fundamental analysis, the Serp API tool fetches the latest crypto-related news from the web, providing additional market context.\n\n🔹 **Chat Window – Deliver Final Insights**\nOnce all data points are processed, the final market analysis is displayed in the chat window, combining technical and fundamental analysis for a more comprehensive trading strategy.\n\n## Use Case:\n\nThis automation simplifies crypto market analysis by integrating AI-driven technical and fundamental insights. It’s ideal for:\n\n✅ Traders looking for automated market insights\n✅ Analysts seeking structured candlestick interpretations\n✅ Developers wanting to integrate AI-powered trading analysis into applications\n\nBy automating candlestick chart analysis, this workflow enhances decision-making and reduces manual effort, making it a valuable tool for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\n## Setup Instructions:\n\n1️⃣ Import the workflow to your n8n instance\n\n2️⃣ Prepare & add credentials:\n\n1. OpenRouter (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) Get a free API key from https://openrouter.ai/\n2. Serp API (for news retrieval) Get a free API key from https://serpapi.com/\n3. Chart Img (For candlestick chart) Get a free API key from https://chart-img.com/\n\n3️⃣ Run the workflow and get AI-powered crypto insights!\n\n## NOTE\n**Remember:** Not all LLM models are capable of analyzing image data, so choose your model wisely.\n\n**Limitations:** All free services come with usage limits. For example, OpenRouter has a daily limit, and once it's consumed, the workflow will stop processing further requests.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis workflow is designed purely for educational and research purposes. It does not provide financial advice. 🚀",
