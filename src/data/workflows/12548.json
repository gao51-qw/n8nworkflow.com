  "description": "## Analyze crypto markets with interactive graphs using CoinGecko and C1 by Thesys\n\nThis n8n template   can answer questions about **real-time prices, market moves, trending coins, and token details** with **interactive UI in real time** (cards, charts, buttons) instead of plain text using C1 by Thesys. Data is fetched through the **CoinGecko Free MCP tool**.\n\n### [Check out a working demo of this template here](https://www.thesys.dev/n8n?url=https://www.thesys.dev/n8n?url=https%3A%2F%2Fasd2224.app.n8n.cloud%2Fwebhook%2F51638b0c-7765-4fa8-9b95-a0422128e203%2Fchat).\n\n### What this workflow does\n1. A user sends a message in the **n8n Chat** UI (public chat trigger).\n2. The **AI Agent** interprets the request.\n3. The agent calls **CoinGecko Free MCP** to fetch market data (prices, coins, trending, etc.).\n4. The model responds through **C1 by Thesys** with a **streaming, UI** answer.\n\n### Example prompts you can try right away\nCopy/paste any of these into the chat:\n\n- “What’s the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum?”\n- “Give me today’s market summary: total market cap, BTC dominance, top gainers/losers.”\n- “Compare ETH vs SOL over 30 days with a chart.”\n\n&gt; Note: This template is for information and visualization, not financial advice.\n\n\n### How it works\n\n1. User sends a prompt\n2. C1 model based on prompt will use CoinGecko MCP to fetch live data\n3. C1 Model generates a UI Schema Response\n4. Schema is rendered as UI using Thesys GenUI SDK on the frontend\n\n\n### Setup \n\nMake sure you have the following:\n\n#### 1️⃣  Thesys API Key\nYou’ll need an API key to authenticate and use Thesys services.\n\n👉 Get your key [here](https://console.thesys.dev/keys)  \n\n### What is C1 by Thesys?\nC1 by [Thesys](https://www.thesys.dev/)  is an API middleware that augments LLMs to respond with **interactive UI (charts, buttons, forms)** in real time instead of text.\n\n### Facing setup issues?\n#### If you get stuck or have questions:\n\n- #### 💬 Join the [Thesys Community](https://discord.com/invite/Pbv5PsqUSv)  \n- #### 📧 Email support:  support@thesys.dev\n",
