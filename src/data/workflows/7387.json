  "description": "# Google Ads automated reporting to spreadsheets with Airtable\n\n## Who's it for\nDigital marketing agencies, PPC managers, and marketing teams who manage multiple Google Ads accounts and need automated monthly performance reporting organized by campaign types and conversion metrics.\n## What it does\nThis workflow automatically retrieves Google Ads performance data from multiple client accounts and populates organized spreadsheets with campaign metrics. It differentiates between e-commerce (conversion value) and lead generation (conversion count) campaigns, then organizes data by advertising channel (Performance Max, Search, Display, etc.) with monthly tracking for budget and performance analysis.\n## How it works\nThe workflow follows an automated data collection and reporting process:\n\nAccount Retrieval: Fetches client information from Airtable (project names, Google Ads IDs, campaign types)\nActive Filter: Processes only accounts marked as \"Actif\" for budget reporting\nCampaign Classification: Routes accounts through e-commerce or lead generation workflows based on \"Typologie ADS\"\nGoogle Ads Queries: Executes different API calls depending on campaign type (conversion value vs. conversion count)\nData Processing: Organizes metrics by advertising channel (Performance Max, Search, Display, Video, Shopping, Demand Gen)\nDynamic Spreadsheet Updates: Automatically fills the correct monthly column in client spreadsheets\nSequential Processing: Handles multiple accounts with wait periods to avoid API rate limits\n\n## Requirements\n\nAirtable account with client database\nGoogle Ads API access with developer token\nGoogle Sheets API access\nClient-specific spreadsheet templates (provided)\n\n## How to set up\n### Step 1: Prepare your reporting template\n\nCopy the Google Sheets reporting template\nCreate individual copies for each client\nEnsure proper column structure (months B-M for January-December)\nLink template URLs in your Airtable database\n\n### Step 2: Configure your Airtable database\nSet up the following fields in your Airtable:\n\nProject names: Client project identifiers\nID GADS: Google Ads customer IDs\nTypologie ADS: Campaign classification (\"Ecommerce\" or \"Lead\")\nStatus - Prévisionnel budgétaire: Account status (\"Actif\" for active accounts)\nAutomation budget: URLs to client-specific reporting spreadsheets\n\n### Step 3: Set up API credentials\nConfigure the following authentication:\n\nAirtable Personal Access Token: For client database access\nGoogle Ads OAuth2: For advertising data retrieval\nGoogle Sheets OAuth2: For spreadsheet updates\nDeveloper Token: Required for Google Ads API access\nLogin Customer ID: Manager account identifier\n\n### Step 4: Configure Google Ads API settings\nUpdate the HTTP request nodes with your credentials:\n\nDeveloper Token: Replace \"[Your token]\" with your actual developer token\nLogin Customer ID: Replace \"[Your customer id]\" with your manager account ID\nAPI Version: Currently using v18 (update as needed)\n\n### Step 5: Set up scheduling\n\nDefault schedule: Runs on the 3rd of each month at 5 AM\nCron expression: 0 5 3 * *\nRecommended timing: Early month execution for complete previous month data\nProcessing delay: 1-minute waits between accounts to respect API limits\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n### Campaign type customization\nE-commerce campaigns:\n\nTracks: Cost and conversion value metrics\nQuery: metrics.conversions_value for revenue tracking\nUse case: Online stores, retail businesses\n\nLead generation campaigns:\n\nTracks: Cost and conversion count metrics\nQuery: metrics.conversions for lead quantity\nUse case: Service businesses, B2B companies\n\n### Advertising channel expansion\nCurrent channels tracked:\n\nPerformance Max: Automated campaign type\nSearch: Text ads on search results\nDisplay: Visual ads on partner sites\nVideo: YouTube and video partner ads\nShopping: Product listing ads\nDemand Gen: Audience-focused campaigns\n\nAdd new channels by modifying the data processing code nodes.\n### Reporting period adjustment\n\nCurrent setting: Last month data (DURING LAST_MONTH)\nAlternative periods: Last 30 days, specific date ranges, quarterly reports\nCustom timeframes: Modify the Google Ads query date parameters\n\n### Multi-account management\n\nSequential processing: Handles multiple accounts automatically\nError handling: Continues processing if individual accounts fail\nRate limiting: Built-in waits prevent API quota issues\nBatch size: No limit on number of accounts processed\n\n## Data organization features\n### Dynamic monthly columns\n\nAutomatic detection: Determines previous month column (B-M)\nColumn mapping: January=B, February=C, ..., December=M\nData placement: Updates correct month automatically\nMulti-year support: Handles year transitions seamlessly\n\n### Campaign performance breakdown\nEach account populates 10 rows of data:\n\nPerformance Max Cost (Row 2)\nPerformance Max Conversions/Value (Row 3)\nDemand Gen Cost (Row 4)\nDemand Gen Conversions/Value (Row 5)\nSearch Cost (Row 6)\nSearch Conversions/Value (Row 7)\nVideo Cost (Row 8)\nVideo Conversions/Value (Row 9)\nShopping Cost (Row 10)\nShopping Conversions/Value (Row 11)\n\n### Data processing logic\n\nCost conversion: Automatically converts micros to euros (÷1,000,000)\nPrecision rounding: Rounds to 2 decimal places for clean presentation\nZero handling: Shows 0 for campaign types with no activity\nData validation: Handles missing or null values gracefully\n\n## Results interpretation\n### Monthly performance tracking\n\nHistorical data: Year-over-year comparison across all channels\nChannel performance: Identify best-performing advertising types\nBudget allocation: Data-driven decisions for campaign investments\nTrend analysis: Month-over-month growth or decline patterns\n\n### Account-level insights\n\nMulti-client view: Consolidated reporting across all managed accounts\nCampaign diversity: Understanding which channels clients use most\nPerformance benchmarks: Compare similar account types and industries\nResource allocation: Focus on high-performing accounts and channels\n\n## Use cases\n### Agency reporting automation\n\nClient dashboards: Automated population of monthly performance reports\nBudget planning: Historical data for next month's budget recommendations\nPerformance reviews: Ready-to-present data for client meetings\nTrend identification: Spot patterns across multiple client accounts\n\n### Internal performance tracking\n\nTeam productivity: Track account management efficiency\nCampaign optimization: Identify underperforming channels for improvement\nGrowth analysis: Monitor client account growth and expansion\nForecasting: Use historical data for future performance predictions\n\n### Strategic planning\n\nBudget allocation: Data-driven distribution across advertising channels\nChannel strategy: Determine which campaign types to emphasize\nClient retention: Proactive identification of declining accounts\nNew business: Performance data to support proposals and pitches\n\n## Workflow limitations\n\nMonthly execution: Designed for monthly reporting (not real-time)\nAPI dependencies: Requires stable Google Ads and Sheets API access\nRate limiting: Sequential processing prevents parallel account handling\nTemplate dependency: Requires specific spreadsheet structure for proper data placement\nPrevious month focus: Optimized for completed month data (run early in new month)\nManual credential setup: Requires individual configuration of API tokens and customer IDs",
