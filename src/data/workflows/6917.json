Predefined templates give you:\n- ⚡ **Faster execution** — no calls to AI models\n- 🎯 **Total control** over tone, formatting, and structure\n- 🛠️ **Easy customization** using variables like `[BusinessName]`, `[Location]`, etc.\n- 💰 **Zero additional cost per email**\n\n\n## 👤 Who It’s For\n- **Freelancers** or **Agencies** running outreach campaigns\n- **Startups** or **SMBs** with lead data in Google Sheets\n- Anyone who wants to automate email sending with **consistency, control, and low cost**.\n\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n1. **Manual Trigger** starts the workflow.\n2. **Google Sheets (Leads tab)** supplies a list of businesses with fields like name, location, email, category, etc.\n3. Loop started to execute each item.\n4. **Google Sheets (Email Template tab)** holds predefined subject and body templates (HTML supported).\n5. A **random template** is selected for each email.\n6.
