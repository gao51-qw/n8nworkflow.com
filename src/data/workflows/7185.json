  "description": "### ⚙ Automated Contract Employee Placement & Management System: Setup Guide\n\nThis guide will walk you through setting up your n8n workflow. By the end, you'll have a fully automated system for managing your contract employee placements, from generating documents to sending renewal reminders.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\nThis workflow is structured in three logical phases to automate the entire contract management lifecycle:\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Placement Trigger & Data Retrieval**: The workflow begins when a new placement record is created in your CRM or database. It automatically retrieves all necessary employee and client data to prepare for contract generation.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Contract Generation & Delivery**: The system uses a pre-made Google Docs template to generate a professional contract. It then automatically sends this document for e-signature via DocuSign to both the employee and the client.\n\n3.  **Phase 3: Post-Placement Management & Reminders**: Once the contract is signed, the workflow updates your database, notifies your team, and adds the start date to your calendar. A separate scheduled automation runs weekly to proactively check for expiring contracts and send renewal reminders.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup Guide\n\nFollow these steps to configure the workflow in your n8n instance.\n\n### **Step 1: Prerequisites & Database Setup**\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following accounts and a workspace set up:\n* **n8n Instance:** Your self-hosted or cloud-based n8n instance.\n* **Airtable:** Your main database for managing placements.\n* **Google Docs:** A contract template saved in your Google Drive.\n* **DocuSign:** For handling electronic signatures.\n* **Slack:** For internal team notifications.\n* **Google Calendar:** For adding start dates to a shared team calendar.\n\n**Airtable Database Preparation:**\nCreate an Airtable base with a `Placements` table. This table must include the following columns:\n* `Candidate Name`\n* `Candidate Email`\n* `Client Name`\n* `Client Contact Email`\n* `Start Date`\n* `End Date`\n* `Status`\n\n**Google Docs Template Preparation:**\nCreate a contract template in Google Docs with placeholders in the format `{{placeholder}}` (e.g., `{{candidateName}}`, `{{clientName}}`).\n\n### **Step 2: Workflow Import & Credential Configuration**\n\n1.  Import the workflow's `.json` file into your n8n instance. All the necessary nodes will appear on your canvas.\n2.  Click on any node with a red **\"!\"** icon (e.g., the `Airtable` or `DocuSign` node).\n3.  Click **\"Create new credential\"** and follow the instructions to connect your accounts. Repeat this for all nodes that require credentials.\n\n### **Step 3: Node-Specific Configuration**\n\nConfigure the following key nodes to match your specific setup:\n\n1.  **Webhooks Trigger**:\n    * Click on the `Webhooks Trigger` node and copy the **Webhook URL**.\n    * Configure your CRM or Airtable to send a `POST` request to this URL whenever a new placement is created.\n\n2.  **Airtable Nodes**:\n    * For every `Airtable` node in the workflow, enter the correct `Base ID` and `Table Name` (`Placements`) that you created in Step 1.\n\n3.  **Google Docs Node**:\n    * In the `Template File ID` field, enter the file ID of your Google Docs contract template.\n    * Map the placeholders you created in your template to the dynamic data from your database (e.g., `{{candidateName}}` should be mapped to `={{ $json.candidate_name }}`).\n\n4.  **DocuSign Node**:\n    * Enter your `Account ID` in the credentials settings.\n    * Map the `Signer Name` and `Signer Email` fields to the data from your database.\n    * Ensure your DocuSign envelope template is configured with anchor text (e.g., `/signature/`) that matches the anchor tags in the DocuSign node.\n\n5.  **Cron Trigger**:\n    * The `Cron Trigger` node is set up to check for expiring contracts. You can adjust the `Interval` parameter (e.g., `Every Week`) to match your desired schedule.\n\n### **Step 4: Activation**\n\n1.  Once all credentials and node configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Toggle the workflow to **\"Active\"** in the top-right corner.\n\nThe workflow is now live! It will automatically handle contract generation, signatures, and reminders for every new placement.",
