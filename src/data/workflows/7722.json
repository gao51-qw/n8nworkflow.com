Here's the flow:\n\n1. **Receive Message from Slack:** A webhook triggers when a message is posted in Slack.\n2. **Check if it’s a valid query:** Filters out non-user messages (e.g., bot mentions).\n3. **Run Agent with RAG:**\n   - Uses GPT-4 with `Query Data Tool` to retrieve relevant document chunks.\n   - Returns a well-formatted, context-aware answer.\n4. **Send Response to Slack:** Fetches user info and posts the answer back in the same channel.\n5. **Document Upload Flow:**\n   - HR can upload the PDF Code of Conduct file.\n   - It’s parsed, chunked, embedded using OpenAI, and stored for future query retrieval.\n   - A backup copy is saved to Google Drive.\n\n## 🛠️ How to set up\n\n1. **Prepare your environment:**\n   - Slack Bot token & webhook configured (Sample slack app manifest: https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/slack_bot_manifest.json)\n   - OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 & embedding)\n   - Google Drive credentials (optional for backup)\n\n2. **Upload the Code of Conduct PDF:**\n   - Use the designated node to upload your document (Sample file: https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/20220419-ingrs-code-of-conduct-policy-en.pdf)\n   - This triggers chunking → embedding → data store.\n\n3. **Deploy the chatbot:**\n   - Host the webhook and connect it to your Slack app.\n   - Share the command format with employees (e.g., `@CodeBot Can I accept gifts from partners?`)\n\n4. **Monitor and iterate:**\n   - Improve chunk size or embed model if queries aren’t accurate.\n   - Review unanswered queries to enhance coverage.\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- n8n (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n- Slack App (with `chat:write`, `users:read`, `commands`)\n- OpenAI account (embedding + GPT-4 access)\n- Google Drive integration (for backups)\n- Uploaded Code of Conduct in PDF format\n\n## 🧩 How to customize the workflow\n\n| What to Customize            | How to Do It                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 🔤 **Prompt style**           | Edit the System & User prompts inside the `Code Of Conduct Agent` node       |\n| 📄 **Document types**         | Upload additional policy PDFs and tag them differently in metadata          |\n| 🤖 **Agent behavior**         | Tune GPT temperature or replace with different LLM                          |\n| 💬 **Slack interaction**      | Customize message formats or trigger phrases                                |\n| 📁 **Data Store engine**      | Swap to Pinecone, Weaviate, Supabase, etc. depending on use case            |\n| 🌐 **Multilingual support**   | Preprocess text and support locale detection via Slack metadata             |",
