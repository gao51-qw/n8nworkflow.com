  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the import of your Google Keep notes into a structured Google Sheet, using Google Drive, OpenAI for AI-powered processing, and JSON file extraction. It's perfect for users who want to turn exported Keep notes into a searchable, filterable spreadsheet – optionally enhanced by AI summarization or transformation.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- Researchers, knowledge workers, and digital minimalists who rely on Google Keep and want to better organize or analyze their notes.\n\n- Anyone who regularly exports Google Keep notes and wants a clean, automated workflow to store them in Google Sheets.\n\n- Users looking to apply AI to process, summarize, or extract insights from raw notes.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nExporting Google Keep notes via Google Takeout gives you unstructured .json files that are hard to read and manage. This workflow solves that by:\n- Filtering relevant .json files\n- Extracting note content\n- (Optionally) applying AI to analyze or summarize each note\n- Writing the result into a structured Google Sheet\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. Google Drive Search: Looks for .json files inside a specified \"Keep\" folder.\n\n2. Loop: Processes files in batches of 10.\n\n3. File Filtering: Filters by .json extension.\n\n4. Download + Extract: Downloads each file and extracts note content from JSON.\n\n5. Optional Filtering: Only keeps non-archived notes or those meeting content criteria.\n\n6. AI Processing (optional): Uses OpenAI to summarize or transform the note content.\n\n7. Prepare for Export: Maps note fields to be written.\n\n8. Google Sheets: Appends or updates the target sheet with the note data.\n\n## Setup\n- Export your Google Keep notes using Google Takeout:\n\n- Deselect all, then choose only Google Keep.\n\n- Choose “Send download link via email”.\n\n- Unzip the downloaded archive and upload the .json files to your Google Drive.\n\n- Connect Google Drive, OpenAI, and Google Sheets in n8n.\n\n- Set the correct folder path for your notes in the “Search in ‘Keep’ folder” node.\n\n- Point the Google Sheet node to your spreadsheet\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\nSkip AI processing: If you don't need summaries or transformations, remove or disable the OpenAI Chat Model node.\n\nFilter criteria: Customize the Filter node to extract only recent notes, or those containing specific keywords.\n\nAI prompts: Edit the Tools Agent or Chat Model node to instruct the AI to summarize, extract tasks, categorize notes, etc.\n\nField mapping: Adjust the “Set fields for export” node to control what gets written to the spreadsheet.\n\nUse this template to build a powerful knowledge extraction tool from your Google Keep archive – ideal for backups, audits, or data-driven insights.",
