If needed, logic can be added to map based on name lookup.\n\n🛠 Setup Instructions:\nConfigure Odoo API credentials for both v15 and v18. (https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/odoo/)\nAdjust domain filters in the “Get Customers” node if needed.\nRun the workflow to begin real-time customer syncing.\n\n📌 Compatibility:\nWorks with Odoo Community & Enterprise\nTested on n8n v1.17+\nRequires access to Odoo’s JSON-RPC API\n",
