This template solves the challenge of automatically collecting, analyzing, and visualizing customer support data to identify trends, improve response times, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.\n\n## 🔧 How it Works\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors customer support channels using AI-powered analysis, processes tickets and feedback, and provides actionable insights for improving customer support operations.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Scheduled Trigger** - Runs the workflow at specified intervals to maintain real-time monitoring\n2. **AI-Powered Ticket Analysis** - Uses advanced NLP to categorize, prioritize, and analyze support tickets\n3. **Multi-Channel Integration** - Monitors email, chat, help desk systems, and social media\n4. **Automated Insights** - Generates reports on trends, response times, and satisfaction scores\n5. **Dashboard Integration** - Stores all data in Google Sheets for comprehensive analysis and reporting\n\n## 📊 Google Sheets Column Specifications\n\nThe template creates the following columns in your Google Sheets:\n\n| Column | Data Type | Description | Example |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| **timestamp** | DateTime | When the ticket was processed | \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\" |\n| **ticket_id** | String | Unique ticket identifier | \"SUP-2024-001234\" |\n| **customer_email** | String | Customer contact information | \"john@example.com\" |\n| **subject** | String | Ticket subject line | \"Login issues with new app\" |\n| **description** | String | Full ticket description | \"I can't log into the mobile app...\" |\n| **category** | String | AI-categorized ticket type | \"Technical Issue\" |\n| **priority** | String | Calculated priority level | \"High\" |\n| **sentiment_score** | Number | Customer sentiment (-1 to 1) | -0.3 |\n| **urgency_indicator** | String | Urgency classification | \"Immediate\" |\n| **response_time** | Number | Time to first response (hours) | 2.5 |\n| **resolution_time** | Number | Time to resolution (hours) | 8.0 |\n| **satisfaction_score** | Number | Customer satisfaction rating | 4.2 |\n| **agent_assigned** | String | Support agent name | \"Sarah Johnson\" |\n| **status** | String | Current ticket status | \"Resolved\" |\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n**Estimated setup time: 20-25 minutes**\n\n### Prerequisites\n- n8n instance with community nodes enabled\n- ScrapeGraphAI API account and credentials\n- Google Sheets account with API access\n- Help desk system API access (Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc.)\n- Email service integration (optional)\n\n### Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n#### 1. Install Community Nodes\n```bash\n# Install required community nodes\nnpm install n8n-nodes-scrapegraphai\nnpm install n8n-nodes-slack\n```\n\n#### 2. Configure ScrapeGraphAI Credentials\n- Navigate to Credentials in your n8n instance\n- Add new ScrapeGraphAI API credentials\n- Enter your API key from ScrapeGraphAI dashboard\n- Test the connection to ensure it's working\n\n#### 3. Set up Google Sheets Connection\n- Add Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials\n- Grant necessary permissions for spreadsheet access\n- Create a new spreadsheet for customer support analysis\n- Configure the sheet name (default: \"Support Analysis\")\n\n#### 4. Configure Support System Integration\n- Update the `websiteUrl` parameters in ScrapeGraphAI nodes\n- Add URLs for your help desk system or support portal\n- Customize the user prompt to extract specific ticket data\n- Set up categories and priority thresholds\n\n#### 5. Set up Notification Channels\n- Configure Slack webhook or API credentials for alerts\n- Set up email service credentials for critical issues\n- Define alert thresholds for different priority levels\n- Test notification delivery\n\n#### 6. Configure Schedule Trigger\n- Set analysis frequency (hourly, daily, etc.)\n- Choose appropriate time zones for your business hours\n- Consider support system rate limits\n\n#### 7. Test and Validate\n- Run the workflow manually to verify all connections\n- Check Google Sheets for proper data formatting\n- Test ticket analysis with sample data\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Customization Options\n\n### Modify Analysis Targets\n- Add or remove support channels (email, chat, social media)\n- Change ticket categories and priority criteria\n- Adjust analysis frequency based on ticket volume\n\n### Extend Analysis Capabilities\n- Add more sophisticated sentiment analysis\n- Implement customer churn prediction models\n- Include agent performance analytics\n- Add automated response suggestions\n\n### Customize Alert System\n- Set different thresholds for different ticket types\n- Create tiered alert systems (info, warning, critical)\n- Add SLA breach notifications\n- Include trend analysis alerts\n\n### Output Customization\n- Add data visualization and reporting features\n- Implement support trend charts and graphs\n- Create executive dashboards with key metrics\n- Add customer satisfaction trend analysis\n\n## 📈 Use Cases\n\n- **Support Ticket Management**: Automatically categorize and prioritize tickets\n- **Response Time Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks in support processes\n- **Customer Satisfaction Monitoring**: Track and improve satisfaction scores\n- **Agent Performance Analysis**: Monitor and improve agent productivity\n- **Product Issue Detection**: Identify recurring problems and feature requests\n- **SLA Compliance**: Ensure support teams meet service level agreements\n\n## 🚨 Important Notes\n\n- Respect support system API rate limits and terms of service\n- Implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid rate limiting\n- Regularly review and update your analysis parameters\n- Monitor API usage to manage costs effectively\n- Keep your credentials secure and rotate them regularly\n- Consider data privacy and GDPR compliance for customer data\n\n## 🔧 Troubleshooting\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI connection errors: Verify API key and account status\n- Google Sheets permission errors: Check OAuth2 scope and permissions\n- Ticket parsing errors: Review the Code node's JavaScript logic\n- Rate limiting: Adjust analysis frequency and implement delays\n- Alert delivery failures: Check notification service credentials\n\n**Support Resources:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI documentation and API reference\n- n8n community forums for workflow assistance\n- Google Sheets API documentation for advanced configurations\n- Help desk system API documentation\n- Customer support analytics best practices\n",
