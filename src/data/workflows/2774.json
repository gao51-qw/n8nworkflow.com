  "description": "![Typeform WF.png](fileId:1065)\n\n**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n**How It Works:**  \n\nTypeform Quiz Integration: This workflow streamlines the process of handling quiz answers submitted via Typeform. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates with KlickTipp.  \nData Transformation: Input data is validated and transformed to meet KlickTipp’s API requirements, including formatting phone numbers and converting dates.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n**Typeform Trigger:**  \n- Captures new quiz submissions from Typeform, including user details and quiz responses.\n\n**Data Processing and Transformation:**  \n- Formats phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  \n- Converts dates (e.g., birthdays) to UNIX timestamps.  \n- Maps multiple-choice quiz answers to string values for API compatibility.  \n- Scales numeric quiz responses for tailored use cases.  \n\n**Subscriber Management in KlickTipp:**  \n- Adds participants as subscribers to a designated KlickTipp list, with custom field mappings for:  \n  - Personal details (e.g., name, email, phone number, birthday).  \n  - Quiz responses (e.g., intended usage of KlickTipp, company location, and team size).\n - Tags contacts for segmentation: Adds fixed and dynamic tags to contacts.  \n\n**Error Handling:**  \n- Handles empty or malformed data gracefully, ensuring clean submissions to KlickTipp.  \n\n**Setup Instructions**  \n\n**Install and Configure Nodes:**  \n- Set up the Typeform and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.  \n- Authenticate your Typeform and KlickTipp accounts.  \n\n**Prepare Custom Fields in KlickTipp:**  \n- Create custom fields to store quiz answers and personal details, such as:  \n\n | **Field Name**                                     | **Field Type**   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Typeform \\| URL Linkedin                           | URL              |\n| Typeform \\| Question 1 KlickTipp benefits          | Text             |\n| Typeform \\| Question 2 KlickTipp headquarter       | Text             |\n| Typeform \\| Question 3 Members CHT                 | Decimal Number   |\n\nAfter creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don’t appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  \n\n**Field Mapping and Adjustments:**  \nVerify and customize field assignments in the workflow to align with your specific form and subscriber list setup.  \n\n**Workflow Logic**  \n\n1. **Trigger via Typeform Submission**:  \n   The workflow initiates upon receiving a new quiz submission.  \n2. **Transform Data for KlickTipp**:  \n   Converts and validates data from Typeform to match KlickTipp’s API requirements.  \n3. **Add to KlickTipp Subscriber List**:  \n   Submits the cleaned data to KlickTipp, including all relevant quiz answers.  \n\n4. **Get all tags from KlickTipp and create a list:** Fetches all existing Tags and turns them into an array\n\n5. **Define tags to dynamically set for contacts:** Definiton of variables that are received from the form submission and should be converted into tags\n\n6. **Merge tags of both lists:** Checks whether the list of existing tags in KlickTipp contains the tags which should be dynamically set based on the form submission\n\n7. **Tag creation and tagging contacts:** Creates new tags if it previously did not exist and then tags the contact\n\n\n**Benefits**  \n\n**Efficient lead generation:** Contacts from forms are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  \n**Automated processes:** Experts can start workflows directly, such as welcome emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  \n**Error-free data management:** The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  \n\n**Testing and Deployment**  \n\nTest the workflow by filling the form on Typeform and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  \n\n**Notes**  \n\n**Customization:** Update field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup. This ensures accurate data syncing.  \n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Typeform KlickTipp Knowledge Base help article](https://www.klicktipp.com/de/support/wissensdatenbank/typeform-integration-n8n/)\n- [Use KlickTipp Community Node in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/install-klicktipp-node-n8n/)\n- [Automate Workflows: KlickTipp Integration in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/klicktipp-integration-n8n/)",
