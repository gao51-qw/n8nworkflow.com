Cloud-based n8n instances currently do not support community nodes.  \n\n## Summary\n\nThis workflow template allows you to **dynamically run SuiteQL queries in NetSuite** by sending an HTTP request to an n8n Webhook node. Once triggered, the workflow uses token-based authentication to execute your SuiteQL query and returns the results as JSON. This makes it easy to integrate real-time NetSuite data into dashboards, reporting tools, or other applications.\n\n## Who Is This For?\n\n- **Developers & Integrators**: Easily embed NetSuite data retrieval into custom apps or internal tools.  \n- **Enterprises & Consultants**: Integrate dynamic reporting or data enrichment from NetSuite without manual exports.  \n- **System Administrators**: Automate routine queries and reduce manual intervention.\n\n## Use Cases & Benefits\n\n### 1. Dynamic Data Access\nSend any SuiteQL query on demand instead of hardcoding queries or manually running reports.\n\n### 2. Seamless Integration\nQuickly pull NetSuite data into front-end systems (like Excel dashboards, custom web apps, or internal tools) by calling the webhook endpoint.\n\n### 3. Simplified Reporting\nAutomate data extraction and formatting, reducing the need for manual exports and improving efficiency.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger**:  \n   - An HTTP request to the webhook node initiates the workflow.  \n\n2. **Input Processing**:  \n   - The workflow reads the SuiteQL query from the incoming request parameter (`suiteql`).  \n\n3. **Query Execution**:  \n   - The NetSuite node uses your token-based authentication credentials to run the SuiteQL query.  \n\n4. **Response**:  \n   - Results are returned as JSON in the HTTP response, ready for further processing or immediate consumption.\n\n## Prerequisites & Setup\n\n1. **NetSuite Community Node**  \n   - This workflow requires the NetSuite community node. Make sure your **self-hosted** n8n instance supports community nodes.\n\n2. **NetSuite Token-Based Authentication**  \n   - Enable TBA in NetSuite. Obtain the required consumer key, consumer secret, token ID, and token secret.\n\n3. **n8n Webhook**  \n   - Copy the auto-generated webhook URL (e.g. `http://&lt;your-n8n-domain&gt;/webhook/unique-id`) from the Webhook node.\n\n4. **Usage**  \n   - Send an HTTP GET or POST request to the webhook with your SuiteQL query. For example:  \n     ```sh\n     curl \"http://&lt;your-n8n-domain&gt;/webhook/unique-id?suiteql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20account%20LIMIT%2010\"\n     ```  \n   - The workflow will execute the query and return JSON data.\n\n## Customization\n\n- **Change the Query**:  \n  Simply adjust the `suiteql` parameter in your HTTP request to run different SuiteQL statements.\n\n- **Data Transformation**:  \n  Insert nodes (e.g., Function, Set, or Format) to modify or reformat the data before returning it.\n\n- **Extend Integration**:  \n  Chain additional nodes to push the retrieved data to other services (Google Sheets, Slack, custom dashboards, etc.).\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- Remember that this template is **only compatible with self-hosted n8n** because it uses a community node. - \n[netsuite community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-netsuite\n)\n- If you have questions, suggestions, or need support, contact us at [support@dataants.org](mailto:support@dataants.org).\n\n---\n",
