  "description": "This workflow provides a comprehensive weather reporting system with two main functionalities: a scheduled daily summary and an interactive AI agent for dynamic queries.\n\n## Who's it for?\n\nThis template is ideal for anyone who wants to stay updated on the weather, from individuals planning their day to teams needing automated daily briefings. It's also a great example for developers and n8n users who want to explore the capabilities of AI Agents and integrating external APIs in their workflows.\n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nThis workflow operates in two distinct modes:\n\n1.  **Scheduled Daily Summary:**\n    *   The workflow triggers automatically every day at 9:00 AM (customizable) or can be run manually.\n    *   It fetches the latest weather data for a specified location (default is near Chiba, Japan) from the Open-Meteo API.\n    *   It then formats a message with the day's maximum and minimum temperatures.\n    *   Finally, it sends this summary to a designated Gmail address and a Slack channel.\n\n2.  **AI-Powered Forecasts via Chat:**\n    *   When you send a message to the Chat Trigger webhook, it activates the AI Agent.\n    *   The AI Agent, powered by an OpenAI model, understands natural language questions like \"What's the humidity right now?\" or \"Will it be warmer tomorrow?\".\n    *   The agent uses an HTTP Request tool to fetch real-time, specific data from the weather API to answer your question.\n    *   The generated answer is then sent back to you via both Gmail and Slack.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1.  **Configure Credentials:** Add your credentials for OpenAI, Gmail, and Slack in the credentials menu.\n2.  **Set Your Location:** In the `Fetch Weather Data` and `HTTP Request Tool for AI` nodes, update the `latitude` and `longitude` in the URL to your desired location.\n3.  **Update Email and Slack:**\n    *   In the `Send Email Summary` and `Send AI Response via Email` nodes, change the recipient email address to your own.\n    *   In the `Send Slack Summary` and `Send AI Response via Slack` nodes, select your desired Slack channel.\n4.  **Adjust the Schedule:** Modify the `Schedule Trigger` node to change the time or frequency of the daily summary.\n5.  **Activate the Workflow:** Click the \"Active\" toggle in the top-right corner to enable the workflow.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n*   **Change the Message:** You can easily customize the notification message in the `Format Daily Summary` node (for the summary) and in the `Send...` nodes for both flows.\n*   **Add More Data:** The Open-Meteo API provides a wealth of data. You can fetch additional information like precipitation, wind speed, or UV index by modifying the URL in the HTTP Request nodes.\n*   **Integrate Other Services:** Add other notification nodes like Discord, Telegram, or Microsoft Teams to send the weather reports to more platforms.",
