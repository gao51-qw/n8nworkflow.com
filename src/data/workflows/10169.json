  "description": "# Validated RSVP Confirmation with Automated Badge Generation\n\n### **Overview:**\n\nThis comprehensive workflow automates the entire event RSVP process from form submission to attendee confirmation, including real-time email validation and personalized digital badge generation.\n\n### **✨ KEY FEATURES**:\n• Real-time Email Validation - Verify attendee emails using VerifiEmail API to prevent fake registrations\n\n• Automated Badge Generation - Create beautiful, personalized event badges with attendee details\n\n• Smart Email Routing - Send confirmation emails with badges for valid emails, rejection notices for invalid ones\n\n• Comprehensive Logging - Track all RSVPs (both valid and invalid) in Google Sheets for analytics\n\n• Dual Path Logic - Handle valid and invalid submissions differently with conditional branching\n\n• Anti-Fraud Protection - Detect disposable emails and invalid domains automatically\n\n### **🔧 WORKFLOW COMPONENTS:**\n\n1. Webhook Trigger - Receives RSVP submissions\n2. Email Validation - Verifies email authenticity using VerifiEmail API\n3. Conditional Logic - Separates valid from invalid submissions\n4. Badge Creator - Generates HTML-based personalized event badges\n5. Image Converter - Converts HTML badges to shareable PNG images using HTMLCssToImage\n6. Email Sender - Delivers confirmation with badge or rejection notice via Gmail\n7. Data Logger - Records all attempts in Google Sheets for tracking and analytics\n\n### **🎯 PERFECT FOR**:\n• Conference organizers managing hundreds of RSVPs\n• Corporate event planners requiring verified attendee lists\n• Webinar hosts preventing fake registrations\n• Workshop coordinators issuing digital badges\n• Community event managers tracking attendance\n\n### **💡 BENEFITS:**\n• Reduces manual verification time by 95%\n• Eliminates fake email registrations\n• Creates professional branded badges automatically\n• Provides real-time RSVP tracking and analytics\n• Improves attendee experience with instant confirmations\n• Maintains clean, verified contact lists\n\n### **🛠️ REQUIRED SERVICES:**\n• n8n (cloud or self-hosted)\n• VerifiEmail API (https://verifi.email)\n• HTMLCssToImage API (https://htmlcsstoimg.com)\n• Gmail account (OAuth2)\n• Google Sheets\n\n### **📈 USE CASE SCENARIO:**\nWhen someone submits your event RSVP form, this workflow instantly validates their email, generates a personalized badge with their details, and emails them a confirmation—all within seconds. Invalid emails receive a helpful rejection notice, and every submission is logged for your records. No manual work required!\n\n### **🎨 BADGE CUSTOMIZATION:**\nThe workflow includes a fully customizable HTML badge template featuring:\n• Gradient background with modern design\n• Attendee name, designation, and organization\n• Event name and date\n• Email address and validation timestamp\n• Google Fonts (Poppins) for professional typography\n\n### **📊 ANALYTICS INCLUDED:**\nTrack metrics like:\n• Total RSVPs received\n• Valid vs invalid email ratio\n• Event-wise registration breakdown\n• Temporal patterns\n• Organization/company distribution\n\n###  **⚡ PERFORMANCE:**\n• Processing time: ~3-5 seconds per RSVP\n• Scales to handle 100+ concurrent submissions\n• Email delivery within 10 seconds\n• Real-time Google Sheets updates\n\n### **🔄 EASY SETUP:**\n1. Import the workflow JSON\n2. Configure your credentials (detailed instructions included)\n3. Create your form with required fields (name, email, event, designation, organization)\n4. Connect the webhook\n5. Activate and start receiving validated RSVPs!\n\n### **🎓 LEARNING VALUE:**\nThis workflow demonstrates:\n• Webhook integration patterns\n• API authentication methods\n• Conditional workflow branching\n• HTML-to-image conversion\n• Email automation best practices\n• Data logging strategies\n• Error handling techniques\n\n---\n\n\n",
