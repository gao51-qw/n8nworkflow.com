  "description": "## This n8n template implements a Calendly Booking Link Generator that creates single-use, personalized booking links, logs them to Google Sheets, and optionally notifies a Slack channel\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis template is designed for **teams and businesses that send Calendly links proactively** and want to **generate trackable, single-use booking links on demand**. It’s perfect for:\n\n- **Sales and SDR teams** sending 1:1 outreach and needing unique booking links per prospect\n- **Customer success and support teams** who want prefilled, one-click rescheduling or follow-up links\n- **Marketing and growth teams** that want UTM-tagged booking links for campaigns\n- **Ops/RevOps** who need a central log of every generated link for tracking and reporting\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow turns a simple HTTP request into a fully configured **single-use Calendly booking link**:\n\n1. **Webhook Trigger (`POST`)**\n   - Receives JSON payload with recipient details:\n   - `name`, `email`, optional `event_type_uri`, optional `utm_source`\n2. **Configuration & Input Normalization**\n   - `Set Configuration` extracts and normalizes:\n     - `recipient_name`, `recipient_email`\n     - `requested_event_type` (can be empty)\n     - `utm_source` (defaults to `\"n8n\"` if not provided)\n3. **Calendly API – User & Event Types**\n   - `Get Current User` calls `GET /users/me` using Calendly OAuth2 to get the current user URI\n   - `Extract User` stores `user_uri` and `user_name`\n   - `Get Event Types` calls `GET /event_types?user={user_uri}&active=true` to fetch active event types\n   - `Select Event Type`:\n     - Uses `requested_event_type` if provided, otherwise selects the **first active** event type\n     - Stores event type URI, name, and duration (minutes)\n4. **Create Calendly Single-Use Scheduling Link**\n   - `Create Single-Use Link` calls `POST /scheduling_links` with:\n     - `owner`: selected event type URI\n     - `owner_type`: `\"EventType\"`\n     - `max_event_count`: `1` (single use)\n5. **Build Personalized Booking URL**\n   - `Build Personalized Link`:\n     - Reads the base `booking_url` from Calendly\n     - Appends query parameters to prefill:\n       - `name` (encoded)\n       - `email` (encoded)\n       - `utm_source`\n     - Stores:\n       - `base_booking_url`\n       - `personalized_booking_url`\n       - `recipient_name`, `recipient_email`\n       - `event_type_name`, `event_duration`\n       - `link_created_at` (ISO timestamp)\n6. **Optional Logging and Notifications**\n   - `Log to Google Sheets` (optional but preconfigured):\n     - Appends each generated link to a **“Generated Links”** sheet\n     - Columns: Recipient Name, Recipient Email, Event Type, Duration (min), Booking URL, Created At, Status\n   - `Notify via Slack` (optional):\n     - Posts a nicely formatted Slack message with:\n       - recipient name & email\n       - event name & duration\n       - clickable booking link\n7. **API Response to Caller**\n   - `Respond to Webhook` returns a structured JSON response:\n     - `success`\n     - `booking_url` (personalized)\n     - `base_url`\n     - `recipient` object\n     - `event` object (name + duration)\n     - `created_at`\n     - `expires` explanation (`\"Single-use or 90 days\"`)\n\nThe result is an **API-style service** you can call from any system to generate trackable, single-use Calendly links.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1. Calendly OAuth2 setup\n- Go to `calendly.com/integrations` or `developer.calendly.com`\n- Create an **OAuth2 application** (or use an existing one)\n- In n8n, create **Calendly OAuth2 credentials**:\n  - Add client ID, client secret, and redirect URL as required by Calendly\n  - Connect your Calendly user account\n- In the workflow, make sure all Calendly HTTP Request nodes use your **Calendly OAuth2 credential**\n\n### 2. Webhook Trigger configuration\n- Open the `Webhook Trigger` node\n- Confirm:\n  - **HTTP Method**: `POST`\n  - **Path**: `generate-calendly-link`\n  - **Response Mode**: `Response Node` (points to `Respond to Webhook`)\n- Copy the **Production URL** from the node once the workflow is active\n- Use this URL as the endpoint for your CRM, outbound tool, or any system that needs to request links\n\n**Expected request body:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n  \"event_type_uri\": \"optional\",\n  \"utm_source\": \"optional\"\n}\n```\n\nIf `event_type_uri` is not provided, the workflow automatically uses the **first active event type** for the current Calendly user.\n\n### 3. Google Sheets setup (optional but recommended)\n- Create a Google Sheet for tracking links\n- Add a sheet/tab named e.g. **“Generated Links”**\n- Set the header row to:\n  - `Recipient Name`, `Recipient Email`, `Event Type`, `Duration (min)`, `Booking URL`, `Created At`, `Status`\n- In n8n:\n  - Create **Google Sheets OAuth2** credentials\n  - Open the `Log to Google Sheets` node\n  - Update:\n    - `documentId` → your spreadsheet ID\n    - `sheetName` → your tab name (e.g. “Generated Links”)\n\n### 4. Slack notification setup (optional)\n- Create a Slack app at `api.slack.com`\n- Add Bot Token scopes (for basic posting):\n  - `chat:write`\n  - `channels:read` (or `groups:read` if posting to private channels)\n- Install the app to your workspace and get the **Bot User OAuth Token**\n- In n8n:\n  - Create a **Slack API** credential using the bot token\n  - Open the `Notify via Slack` node\n  - Select your credential\n  - Set:\n    - `select`: `channel`\n    - `channelId`: your desired channel (e.g. `#sales` or `#booking-links`)\n\n### 5. Test the workflow end-to-end\n- Activate the workflow\n- Use Postman, curl, or another system to `POST` to the webhook URL, e.g.:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Test User\",\n  \"email\": \"test@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n- Verify:\n  - The HTTP response contains a valid `booking_url`\n  - A new row is added to your Google Sheet (if configured)\n  - A Slack notification is posted (if configured)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Calendly account** with at least one **active event type**\n- **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted) with public access for the webhook\n- **Calendly OAuth2 credentials** configured in n8n\n- (Optional) **Google Sheets account** and OAuth2 credentials\n- (Optional) **Slack workspace** with permissions to install a bot and post to channels\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Input & validation\n- Update the `Set Configuration` node to:\n  - Enforce required fields (e.g. fail if `email` is missing)\n  - Add more optional parameters (e.g. `utm_campaign`, `utm_medium`, `language`)\n- Add an `IF` node after the Webhook Trigger for stricter validation and custom error responses\n\n### Event type selection logic\n- In `Select Event Type`:\n  - Change the fallback selection rule (e.g. pick the **longest** or **shortest** duration event)\n  - Add logic to map a custom field (like `event_key`) to specific event type URIs\n\n### Link parameters & tracking\n- In `Build Personalized Link`:\n  - Add additional query parameters (e.g. `utm_campaign`, `source`, `segment`)\n  - Remove or rename existing parameters if needed\n- If you don’t want prefilled name/email, remove those query parameters and just keep tracking fields\n\n### Google Sheets logging\n- Extend the `Log to Google Sheets` mapping to include:\n  - `utm_source` or other marketing attributes\n  - Sales owner, campaign name, or pipeline stage\n  - Any additional fields you compute in previous nodes\n\n### Slack notification formatting\n- In `Notify via Slack`:\n  - Adjust the message text to your team’s tone\n  - Add emojis or @mentions for certain event types\n  - Include `utm_source` or other metadata for debugging and tracking\n\n## Key features\n\n- **Single-use Calendly links** – each generated link is limited to one booking (or expires after ~90 days)\n- **Prefilled recipient details** – name and email are embedded in the URL, making it frictionless to book\n- **Webhook-first design** – easily call this from CRMs, outreach tools, or any external system\n- **Central link logging** – every link is stored in Google Sheets for auditing and reporting\n- **Optional Slack alerts** – keep sales/support teams notified when new links are generated\n- **Safe error handling** – HTTP nodes are configured with `continueRegularOutput` to avoid hard workflow failures\n\n## Example scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Sales outreach\n1. A CRM workflow triggers when a lead moves to “Meeting Requested”.\n2. It calls this n8n webhook with the lead’s `name` and `email`.\n3. The workflow generates a single-use Calendly link, logs it to Sheets, and posts to Slack.\n4. The CRM sends an email to the lead with the personalized booking link.\n\n### Scenario 2: Automated follow-up link\n1. A support ticket is resolved and the system wants to offer a follow-up call.\n2. It calls the webhook with `name`, `email`, and a dedicated `event_type_uri` for “Follow-up Call”.\n3. The generated link is logged and returned via API, then included in an automated email.\n\n### Scenario 3: Campaign tracking\n1. A marketing automation tool triggers this webhook for each contact in a campaign, passing `utm_source` (e.g. `q1-outbound`).\n2. The workflow adds `utm_source` to the link and logs it in Google Sheets.\n3. Later, you can analyze which campaigns generated the most completed bookings from single-use links.\n\nThis template gives you a **reliable, reusable Calendly link generation service** that plugs into any part of your stack, while keeping tracking, logging, and team visibility fully automated.\n\n\n",
