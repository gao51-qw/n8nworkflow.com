  "description": "# Initial Outreach Email Workflow\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to automate personalized cold email outreach using AI and a lead database.  \nIt’s designed to contact unengaged leads, personalize messages at scale, and schedule follow-ups automatically.  \n\n**Use cases are many:** Reach out to new leads, qualify prospects, start conversations, and set up consistent follow-up routines.  \nGreat for sales teams, recruiters, and agencies running cold outreach campaigns.  \n\n---\n\n## Good to know\n- Each AI personalization costs about **$0.001 with Groq** (free tier available; pricing may vary by provider).  \n- The workflow limits emails to **15 per day by default** to protect your email reputation and reduce spam risk.  \n- The email template is fully customizable to match your **brand tone and offer**.  \n- Outreach timing and follow-up intervals are easy to adjust within the workflow.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n- **NocoDB** fetches leads who haven’t been contacted yet (no “Initial Contact Date”).  \n- The **Limit node** ensures no more than 15 emails per run.  \n- **AI personalizes** your chosen email template with lead name and company.  \n- Emails are sent via **SMTP or Gmail node**.  \n- Each contacted lead is updated in the database with today’s **Initial Contact Date** and a **Next Follow-up Date** (default 3 days later).  \n- The workflow runs on a **daily schedule** at 10:30 AM (configurable).  \n\n---\n\n## How to use\n- Set up a **NocoDB/any database table** with:  \n  - `first_name`  \n  - `email`  \n  - `Initial Contact Date`  \n  - `Next Follow up/Contact`  \n  - `organization_name` (optional)  \n- Customize the **email template** inside the AI node.  \n- Adjust the **daily limit** and schedule to match your outreach capacity.  \n- Import leads into NocoDB and configure credentials for **NocoDB, AI provider, and SMTP**.  \n- Run the workflow manually for testing before going live.  \n",
