When a new form is dedected, a message is sent in the #general Slack channel with a hyperlink to the new channel.\n\n**This is useful for:**\nWebflow form submissions can only notify a single user email as standard, but by using this workflow you can notify team members of new submissions instead of having to login into Webflow to go download form submissions.\n\n**Usage guide**\n[Full written and video guide](https://blog.kreonovo.co.za/send-webflow-form-submissions-to-slack-automatically/)\n\nThe main steps are to create credentials for Webflow and Slack, connect them, and start using the workflow. The video guide illustrates a realword usecase using a Webflow template. The video also breaks down each node in detail to explain what it does in case you want to make modifications.",
