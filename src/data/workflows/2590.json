This template is ideal for developers and project managers looking to stay up-to-date with software updates.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Daily Trigger: The workflow initiates daily using the Schedule Trigger node.\n- Fetch Repository Data: The HTTP Request node retrieves the latest release details from the specified GitHub repository.\n- Check if new: The IF node check if the release was done in the last 24 hours.\n- Split Content: The Split Out node processes the JSON response to extract and structure relevant data.\n- Convert Markdown: The Markdown node converts release notes from Markdown format to HTML, making them ready to use in emails.\n- Send a notification by email\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- Simple to customize by modifying the GitHub URL.\n- Automatically processes and formats release notes for better readability.\n- Modular design, allowing integration with other workflows like Gmail or Slack notifications.\n\n**Setup Steps:**\n\n- Modify Repository URL: Update the Sticky Note node with the URL of the repository you want to monitor.\n- Modify SMTP details: Update the Send Email node with your SMTP details.\n",
