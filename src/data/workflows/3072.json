  "title": "Send voice calls in seconds: Automate Text-To-Speech using ClickSend API",
  "description": "This workflow automates the process of sending **text-to-speech (TTS) voice calls** using API. It allows users to submit a form with the message content, recipient's phone number, voice type, and language, and then sends a voice call with the provided text. \n\nThis workflow is a simple yet powerful way to automate text-to-speech voice calls using API. It’s ideal for notifications, reminders, or any scenario where voice communication is needed.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to send voice calls with text-to-speech functionality. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Form Submission**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Form Trigger** node, where users submit a form with the following fields:\n     - **Body**: The text message to be converted to speech (max 600 characters).\n     - **To**: The recipient's phone number (including the international prefix, e.g., +39xxxxxxxxxx).\n     - **Voice**: The voice type (male or female).\n     - **Lang**: The language for the voice call (e.g., en-us, it-it, fr-fr, etc.).\n   - Once the form is submitted, the workflow is triggered.\n\n2. **Send Voice Call**:\n   - The **Send Voice** node sends a POST request to the **ClickSend API** (`https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/voice/send`).\n   - The request includes:\n     - The **text message** (Body) to be converted to speech.\n     - The **recipient's phone number** (To).\n     - The **voice type** (Voice).\n     - The **language** (Lang).\n     - **Machine detection** is enabled to detect if the call is answered by a machine.\n   - The API processes the request and initiates a voice call to the specified number, where the text is read aloud by the selected voice.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - The recipient receives a voice call, and the submitted text is read aloud in the chosen voice and language.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Register on ClickSend**:\n   - Go to [ClickSend](https://clicksend.com/?u=586989) and create an account.\n   - Obtain your **API Key** and take advantage of the **2 € free credits** provided.\n\n2. **Configure ClickSend API in n8n**:\n   - In the **Send Voice** node, set up **HTTP Basic Authentication**:\n     - **Username**: Use the username you registered with on ClickSend.\n     - **Password**: Use the **API Key** provided by ClickSend.\n\n3. **Set Up the Form Trigger**:\n   - The **Form Trigger** node is pre-configured with fields for:\n     - **Body**: The text message to be converted to speech.\n     - **To**: The recipient's phone number.\n     - **Voice**: Choose between male or female voice.\n     - **Lang**: Select the language for the voice call.\n   - Customize the form fields if needed (e.g., add more languages or voice options).\n\n4. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Submit the form with the required details (text, phone number, voice, and language).\n   - The workflow will send a voice call to the specified number, and the recipient will hear the text read aloud.\n\n5. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more languages or voice options.\n     - Sending multiple voice calls in bulk.\n     - Integrating with other APIs or services for advanced use cases.\n---\n\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
