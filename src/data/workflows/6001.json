Below is a step-by-step guide to importing the Smart Restaurant Order & Suggestion System workflow in n8n.\n\n### Steps to Import a Workflow in n8n\n\n1. **Obtain the Workflow JSON**\n   - **Source the Workflow**: Workflows are shared as JSON files or code snippets, e.g., from the n8n community, a colleague, or exported from another n8n instance.\n   - **Format**: Ensure you have the workflow in JSON format, either as a file (e.g., workflow.json) or copied text.\n\n2. **Access the n8n Workflow Editor**\n   - Log in to n8n (via n8n Cloud or self-hosted instance).\n   - Navigate to the Workflows tab in the n8n dashboard.\n   - Click Add Workflow to create a blank workflow.\n\n3. **Import the Workflow**\n   - **Option 1: Import via JSON Code (Clipboard)**:\n     - Click the three dots (⋯) in the top-right corner to open the menu.\n     - Select Import from Clipboard.\n     - Paste the JSON code into the text box.\n     - Click Import to load the workflow.\n   - **Option 2: Import via JSON File**:\n     - Click the three dots (⋯) in the top-right corner.\n     - Select Import from File.\n     - Choose the .json file from your computer.\n     - Click Open to import.\n\n### Setup Notes\n- **Google Sheet Columns**:\n  - **Customer Details Sheet**: `Customer id`, `Customer name`, `Customer mobile number` (e.g., `CUST-JW4Z8Y`, `ajay`, `9898989898`; `CUST-VEITPW`, `akash`, `9898976898`).\n  - **Customer Order Details Sheet**: `Customer id`, `Dish name`, `Dish quantity`, `Per unit price`, `Actual price` (e.g., `CUST-JW4Z8Y`, `Tandoori Chicken`, `1`, `250`, `250`; `CUST-VEITPW`, `Masala Dosa`, `1`, `150`, `150`).\n- **Google Sheets Credentials**: Configure OAuth2 settings in the extract and save nodes with your Google Sheet ID and credentials.\n- **Gemini AI**: Set up the Gemini AI node with Google Chat Model and Think Tool credentials.\n- **Telegram Integration**: Authorize the Send Suggestions node with Telegram API credentials and the customer’s chat ID or mobile number.\n- **Trigger Setup**: Configure the New Order Trigger node to detect new orders (e.g., via form or webhook).",
