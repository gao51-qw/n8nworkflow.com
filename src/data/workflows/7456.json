  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow automates your initial hiring pipeline by creating an AI-powered CV scanner. It collects job applications through a web form, uses AI to analyze the candidate's CV against your job description, and neatly organizes the results in a Google Sheet.\n\nHere’s the step-by-step process:\n*   **The Application Form:** A `Form Trigger` provides a public web form for candidates to submit their name, email, and CV (as a PDF).\n*   **Initial Logging:** As soon as an application is submitted, the candidate's name and email are added to a Google Sheet. This ensures every applicant is logged, even if a later step fails.\n*   **CV Text Extraction:** The workflow uses **Mistral's OCR** model to accurately extract all the text from the uploaded CV PDF.\n*   **AI Analysis:** The extracted text is sent to **Google Gemini**. A detailed prompt instructs the AI to act as a hiring assistant, scoring the CV against the specific requirements of your job role and providing a detailed explanation for its score.\n*   **Structured Output:** A `JSON Output Parser` ensures the AI's analysis is returned in a clean, structured format, making the data reliable.\n*   **Final Record:** The AI-generated qualification score and explanation are added to the candidate's row in the Google Sheet, giving you a complete, analyzed list of applicants.\n\n### Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~15 minutes**\n\nYou'll need API keys for Mistral and Google AI, and to connect your Google account.\n\n1.  **Get Your Mistral API Key:**\n    *   Visit the Mistral Platform at [console.mistral.ai/api-keys](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys).\n    *   Create and copy your API key.\n    *   In the workflow, go to the **`Extract CV Text`** node, click the **Credential** dropdown, and select **`+ Create New Credential`**.\n    *   Paste your key into the **API Key** field and **Save**.\n\n2.  **Get Your Google AI API Key:**\n    *   Visit Google AI Studio at [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).\n    *   Click **\"Create API key in new project\"** and copy the key.\n    *   In the workflow, go to the **`Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite`** node, click the **Credential** dropdown, and select **`+ Create New Credential`**.\n    *   Paste your key into the **API Key** field and **Save**.\n\n3.  **Connect Your Google Account:**\n    *   Select the **`Create 'CVs' Spreadsheet`** node.\n    *   Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`** to connect your Google account.\n    *   Repeat this for the **`Log Candidate Submission`** and **`Add CV Analysis`** nodes, selecting the credential you just created.\n\n4.  **Create Your Spreadsheet:**\n    *   Click the \"play\" icon on the **`Start Here`** node to run it. This will create a new Google Sheet in your Google Drive named \"CVs\" with the correct columns.\n\n5.  **Customize the Job Role:**\n    *   Go to the **`AI Qualification`** node.\n    *   In the **Text** parameter, find the `job_requirements` section and replace the example job description with your own. Be as detailed as possible for the best results.\n\n6.  **Start Screening!**\n    *   Activate the workflow using the toggle at the top right.\n    *   Go to the **`Application Form`** node and click the **\"Open Form URL\"** button.\n    *   Fill out the form with a test application and upload a sample CV.
