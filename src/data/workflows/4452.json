  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* **Finance teams** that need to process incoming invoices faster with minimal errors\n* **Small to mid-sized businesses** that want to automate invoice intake, review, and storage\n* **Operations managers** who require approval workflows and centralized record-keeping\n\n## **What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\nManually processing invoices is time-consuming, error-prone, and often lacks structure. This workflow solves those challenges by:\n\n* **Automating the intake of invoices** from multiple sources (email, Google Drive, web form)\n* **Extracting invoice data using AI**, eliminating manual data entry\n* **Implementing an email-based approval system** to add human oversight\n* **Automatically storing approved invoice data** in Google Sheets for easy access and reporting\n* **Notifying stakeholders** when invoices are approved or rejected\n\n## **What this workflow does**\n\nThis end-to-end invoice processing workflow includes:\n\n1. **Three invoice input methods**: Google Drive folder monitor, Gmail attachments, and web form uploads\n2. **PDF to text extraction** for each input method using native PDF parsing\n3. **AI-powered invoice analysis** with GPT-4 to extract structured fields such as vendor, total, and due date\n4. **Dynamic categorization** of invoice type (e.g., Travel, Software, Utilities) via AI\n5. **Email-based approval workflow** with embedded forms to collect decisions and notes\n6. **Automated Google Sheets logging** of all invoice data, approval status, and reviewer feedback\n7. **Rejection notifications** sent automatically to your finance team for transparency and follow-up\n\n## **Setup**\n\n1. **Copy the Google Sheet template** here:  \n👉 [PDF Invoice Parser with Approval Workflow – Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ueJfN5dFTXY3_AdvnYUL5_RjV9YwSFvbxwA_ivtqnJk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n2. **Connect your Google Drive** account and specify the invoice folder ID  \n3. **Set up Gmail** to monitor incoming invoices with PDF attachments  \n4. **Enable your form trigger** to accept direct uploads from your internal or external users  \n5. **Enter your OpenAI API key** in the AI processing node for data extraction  \n6. **Configure Google Sheets** with a target spreadsheet to store invoice data  \n7. **Set recipient email addresses** for invoice approvals and rejection notifications  \n8. **Test with a sample invoice** to ensure end-to-end flow is working  \n\n\n## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n* **Change input sources**: Replace Gmail with Outlook or use Slack uploads instead\n* **Add validation steps**: Include regex or keyword checks before AI analysis\n* **Customize the AI schema**: Modify the expected JSON structure based on your internal finance system\n* **Integrate with accounting tools**: Add Xero, QuickBooks, or custom API nodes to push data\n* **Route based on category**: Add conditional logic to handle invoices differently based on vendor or category\n* **Multi-level approvals**: Add additional email steps if higher-level signoff is needed\n* **Audit logging**: Use database or Google Sheets to maintain a historical log of approvals and rejections\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**",
