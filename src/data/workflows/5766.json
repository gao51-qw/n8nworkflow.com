  "description": "### This N8N template makes it easy to extract key YouTube video data - including title, view count, like count, comment count, and many more - and save it directly into a connected Google Sheet.\n\nUse cases are many: Whether you're **YouTubers**, **content strategists**, **growth marketers**, and **automation engineers**, this tool gives you fast, structured access to video-level insights in seconds.\n\n## How It Works\n- The workflow begins when you click **Execute Workflow** or **Test Workflow** manually in N8N.\n- It reads the list of video URLs in the connected Google Sheet. Only the URLs marked with the **Ready** status will be processed.\n- The tool loops through each video and prepares the necessary data for the YouTube API call later.\n- For each available URL, the tool extracts the video ID and sends a request to the YouTube API to fetch key metrics.\n- The response is checked:\n     - **If successful**: the video’s statistics are written back to the corresponding row in the Google Sheet and the row's status is marked as **Finished**.\n     - **If unsuccessful**: the row's status is updated to **Error** for later review.\n\n## How To Use\n- Download the workflow package.\n- Import the workflow package into your N8N interface.\n- Duplicate the [**YouTube - Get Video Statistics** Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9gyb27WiRHz--g-xi-QH1W3WppZJdSfY6L32-DyUw0/edit?gid=426418282#gid=426418282) into your Google Sheets account.\n- Set up **Google Cloud Console** credentials in the following nodes in N8N, ensuring enabled access and suitable rights to Google Sheets and YouTube services:\n    + For Google Sheets access, ensure each node is properly connected to the correct tab in your connected Google Sheet template:\n       Node **Google Sheets - Get Video URLs** → connected to Tab **Video URLs**;\n       Node **Google Sheets - Update Data** → connected to Tab **Video URLs**;\n       Node **Google Sheets - Update Data - Error** → connected to Tab **Video URLs**.\n    + For YouTube access, set up a GET method to connect to YouTube API in the following node:\n      Node **HTTP - Find Video Data**.\n- In your connected Google Sheet, enter the video URLs that you want to crawl and set the rows' status to **Ready**.\n- Run the workflow by clicking **Execute Workflow** or **Test Workflow** in N8N.\n- View the results in your connected Google Sheet: Successful fetches will update the rows' status in **Column A** in the **Video URLs** tab to **Finished** and the video metrics will populate. If the call fails, the rows' status in **Column A** in the tab will be marked as **Error**.\n\n## Requirements\n- Basic setup in Google Cloud Console (OAuth or API Key method enabled) with enabled access to YouTube and Google Sheets.\n\n## How To Customize\n- By default, the workflow is manually triggered in N8N. However, you can automate the process by adding **a Google Sheets trigger** that monitors new entries automatically.\n- If you want to fetch additional video fields or analytics (like tags, category ID, etc.), you can expand the **HTTP - Find Video Data** node to include those.\n\n## Need Help?\nJoin our community on different platforms for support, inspiration and tips from others.\n\nWebsite: https://www.agentcircle.ai/\nEtsy: https://www.etsy.com/shop/AgentCircle\nGumroad: http://agentcircle.gumroad.com/\nDiscord Global: https://discord.gg/d8SkCzKwnP\nFB Page Global: https://www.facebook.com/agentcircle/\nFB Group Global: https://www.facebook.com/groups/aiagentcircle/\nX: https://x.com/agent_circle\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@agentcircle\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentcircle",
