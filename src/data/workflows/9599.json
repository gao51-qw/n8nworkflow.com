  "description": "### **Monitor RSS Feeds, Extract Full Articles, and Save to Supabase**\n\n## Overview\n\nThis workflow solves a common problem with RSS feeds: they often only provide a short summary or snippet of the full article. This template automatically monitors a list of your favorite blog RSS feeds, filters for new content, visits the article page to extract the **entire blog post**, and then saves the structured data into a Supabase database.\n\nIt's designed for **content creators**, **marketers**, **researchers**, and anyone who needs to build a personal knowledge base, conduct competitive analysis, or power a content aggregation system without manual copy-pasting.\n\n-----\n\n## Use Cases\n\n  * **Content Curation:** Automatically gather full-text articles for a newsletter or social media content.\n  * **Personal Knowledge Base:** Create a searchable archive of articles from experts in your field.\n  * **Competitive Analysis:** Track what competitors are publishing without visiting their blogs every day.\n  * **AI Model Training:** Collect a clean, structured dataset of full-text articles to fine-tune an AI model.\n\n-----\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow runs automatically on a set schedule (default is once per day).\n2.  **Fetch RSS Feeds:** It takes a list of RSS feed URLs you provide in the \"blogs to track\" node.\n3.  **Filter for New Posts:** It checks the publication date of each article and only continues if the article is newer than a specified age (e.g., published within the last 60 days).\n4.  **Extract Full Content:** For each new article, the workflow uses the [Jina AI Reader URL (`https://r.jina.ai/`)](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://jina.ai/reader/%5D\\(https://jina.ai/reader/\\)) to scrape the full, clean text from the blog post's webpage. This is a free and powerful way to get past the RSS snippet limit.\n5.  **Save to Supabase:** Finally, it organizes the extracted data and saves it to your chosen Supabase table. The following data is saved by default:\n      * `title`\n      * `source_url` (the link to the original article)\n      * `content_snippet` (the full extracted article text)\n      * `published_date`\n      * `creator` (the author)\n      * `status` (a static value you can set, e.g., \"new\")\n      * `content_type` (a static value you can set, e.g., \"blog\")\n\n-----\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nYou can get this template running in about 10-15 minutes.\n\n1.  **Set Up Your RSS Feed List:**\n\n      * Navigate to the **\"blogs to track\"** Set node.\n      * In the `source_identifier` field, replace the example URLs with the RSS feed URLs for the blogs you want to monitor. You can add as many as you like.\n      * *Tip:* The best way to find a site's RSS feed is to use a tool like Perplexity or a web-browsing enabled LLM.\n\n    \n\n    ```javascript\n    // Example list of RSS feeds\n    ['https://blog.n8n.io/rss', 'https://zapier.com/blog/feeds/latest/']\n    ```\n\n2.  **Configure the Content Age Filter:**\n\n      * Go to the **\"max\\_content\\_age\\_days\"** Set node.\n      * Change the `value` from the default `60` to your desired timeframe (e.g., `7` to only get articles from the last week).\n\n3.  **Connect Your Storage Destination:**\n\n      * The template uses the **\"Save Blog Data to Database\"** Supabase node.\n      * First, ensure you have a table in your Supabase project with columns to match the data (e.g., `title`, `source_url`, `content_snippet`, `published_date`, `creator`, etc.).\n      * In the n8n node, create new credentials using your Supabase Project URL and Service Role Key.\n      * Select your table from the list and map the data fields from the workflow to your table columns.\n      * **Want to use something else?** You can easily replace the Supabase node with a **Google Sheets**, **Airtable**, or the built-in **n8n Table** node. Just drag the final connection to your new node and configure the field mapping.\n\n4.  **Set Your Schedule:**\n\n      * Click on the first node, **\"Schedule Trigger\"**.\n      * Adjust the trigger interval to your needs. The default is every day at noon.\n\n5.  **Activate Workflow:**\n\n      * Click the \"Save\" button, then toggle the workflow to **Active**. You're all set\\!",
