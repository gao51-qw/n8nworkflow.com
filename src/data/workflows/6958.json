  "description": "# ⚙️ Advanced Equipment Health Monitor with MS Teams Integration (n8n | API | Google Sheets | MSTeams)\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically monitors equipment health by fetching real-time metrics like temperature, voltage and operational status. If any of these parameters cross critical thresholds, an alert is instantly sent to a Microsoft Teams channel and the event is logged in Google Sheets. The workflow runs every 15 minutes by default.\n\n## ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Import the workflow JSON** into your n8n instance.\n2. **Open the \"Set Config\" node** and update:\n   - API endpoint\n   - Teams webhook URL\n   - Threshold values\n   - Google Sheet ID\n3. **Activate the workflow** to start receiving alerts every 15 minutes.\n\n## 🎯 Who’s It For\n\n- Renewable energy site operators (solar, wind)\n- Plant maintenance and operations teams\n- Remote infrastructure monitoring services\n- IoT-integrated energy platforms\n- Enterprise environments using Microsoft Teams\n\n## 🛠 Requirements\n\n| Tool | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| n8n Instance | To run and schedule automation |\n| HTTP API | Access to your equipment or IoT platform health API |\n| Microsoft Teams | Incoming Webhook URL configured |\n| Google Sheets | Logging and analytics |\n| SMTP (optional) | For email-based alternatives or expansions |\n\n## 🧠 What It Does\n\n- **Runs every 15 minutes** to check the latest equipment metrics.\n- **Compares values** (temperature, voltage, status) against configured thresholds.\n- **Triggers a Microsoft Teams message** when a threshold is breached.\n- **Appends the alert data** to a Google Sheet for logging and review.\n\n## 🧩 Workflow Components\n\n- **Set Node:** Configures thresholds, endpoints, webhook URL and Sheet ID.\n- **Cron Node:** Triggers the check every 15 minutes.\n- **HTTP Request Node:** Pulls data from your equipment health monitoring API.\n- **IF Node:** Evaluates if conditions are within or outside defined limits.\n- **MS Teams Alert Node:** Sends structured alerts using a Teams incoming webhook.\n- **Google Sheets Node:** Logs alert details for recordkeeping and analytics.\n\n## 🔧 How To Set Up – Step-by-Step\n\n1. **Import Workflow:**\n   - In n8n, click **Import** and upload the provided `.json` file.\n\n2. **Update Configurations:**\n   - Open the **Set Config** node.\n   - Replace the placeholder values:\n     - `apiEndpoint`: URL to fetch equipment data.\n     - `teamsWebhookUrl`: Your MS Teams channel webhook.\n     - `temperatureThreshold`: Example = 80\n     - `voltageThreshold`: Example = 400\n     - `googleSheetId`: Google Sheet ID (must be shared with n8n service account).\n\n3. **Check Webhook Integration:**\n   - Ensure your MS Teams webhook is properly authorized and points to a live channel.\n\n4. **Run & Monitor:**\n   - Enable the workflow and view logs/alerts.\n   - Adjust thresholds as needed.\n\n## 🧪 How To Customize\n\n| Customization | How |\n|---------------|-----|\n| Add more parameters (humidity, pressure) | Extend the HTTP + IF node conditions |\n| Change alert frequency | Edit the Cron node |\n| Use Slack or Email instead of Teams | Replace MS Teams node with Slack or Email node |\n| Add PDF Report Generation | Use HTML → PDF node and email the report |\n| Export to Database | Add a PostgreSQL or MySQL node instead of Google Sheets |\n\n## ➕ Add‑ons (Advanced)\n\n| Add-on | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 📦 Auto-Ticketing | Auto-create issues in Jira, Trello or ClickUp for serious faults |\n| 📊 Dashboard Sync | Send real-time logs to BigQuery or InfluxDB |\n| 🧠 Predictive Alerts | Use machine learning APIs to flag anomalies |\n| 🗂 Daily Digest | Compile all incidents into a daily summary email or Teams post |\n| 📱 Mobile Alert | Integrate Twilio for SMS alerts or WhatsApp notifications |\n\n## 📈 Example Use Cases\n\n1.
