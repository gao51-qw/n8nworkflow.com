If you often find yourself stuck at the research stage or manually drafting blog content, this workflow automates the entire process from topic discovery to publication.\n\n---\n\n## What it does\n\nThe workflow takes a **keyword**, performs a Google search using **Dumpling AI**, analyzes the top-ranking pages and People Also Ask (PAA) questions, and then uses **GPT-4** to generate a detailed blog post based on the most valuable question. The blog draft is sent for approval via email, and once approved, it’s automatically published to **WordPress**.\n\nHere’s what happens step by step:  \n1. Receives a keyword through a simple form  \n2. Uses **Dumpling AI** to perform a Google search and extract:  \n   - Top 2 organic search results  \n   - People Also Ask (PAA) questions and answers  \n   - Top related searches  \n3. Filters for insightful PAA questions  \n4. Sends the data to **GPT-4** to generate a blog post in JSON format  \n5. Emails the draft blog post for manual review and approval  \n6. If approved, publishes the post automatically to WordPress\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Form Trigger**: Captures the keyword input  \n2. **Dumpling AI**: Searches Google and extracts SEO data including top results, PAA, and related searches  \n3. **Code Node**: Processes the raw search data into a structured format for GPT-4  \n4. **Filter Node**: Checks if PAA questions are available  \n5. **GPT-4**: Chooses a strong PAA question and writes the blog post  \n6. **Gmail**: Sends the draft blog post to your inbox for review  \n7. **Approval Node**: Waits for manual approval  \n8. **WordPress**: Publishes the approved post automatically\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- ✅ **Dumpling AI API key** stored securely as credentials  \n- ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4 credentials**  \n- ✅ **Gmail account** with OAuth2 connected to n8n  \n- ✅ **WordPress account** with API credentials configured\n\n---\n\n## How to customize\n\n- Edit the GPT-4 prompt to control the blog structure, tone, or style  \n- Add extra filters to select specific types of PAA questions (e.g., how-to, guides)  \n- Change the review recipient email in the Gmail node  \n- Add additional formatting or SEO optimization steps before publishing  \n- Integrate with Notion, Airtable, or Slack to log or notify team members after publication\n\n---\n\n&gt; This workflow turns a single keyword into a fully researched, GPT-4 generated, and auto-published blog post — helping you scale content creation efficiently while maintaining quality.\n",
