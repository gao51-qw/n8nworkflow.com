It automates the process of extracting data from receipts/invoices, logging it to a Google Sheet, and notifying the finance team via email.\n## 👤 Who’s it for\nIdeal users:\n- Employees submitting business trip expense claims\n- HR or Admins reviewing travel-related reimbursements\n- Finance teams responsible for processing claims\n\n## ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\n1. **Employee submits a form** with trip information (name, department, purpose, dates) and uploads one or more receipts/invoices (PDF).\n2. **Uploaded files are saved to Google Drive** for record-keeping.\n3. Each PDF is passed to a **DocClaim Assistant agent**, which uses GPT-4o and a structured parser to extract structured invoice data.\n4. The data is **transformed and formatted** into a standard JSON structure.\n5. Two parallel paths are followed:\n   - Invoice records are appended to a **Google Sheet** for centralized tracking.\n   - A detailed **HTML email** summarizing the trip and expenses is generated and sent to the **finance department** for claim processing.\n\n## 🛠 How to set up\n\n1. **Create a form** to capture:\n   - Employee Name\n   - Department\n   - Trip Purpose\n   - From Date / To Date\n   - Receipt/Invoice File Upload (multiple PDFs)\n\n2. **Configure file upload node** to store files in a specific Google Drive folder.\n\n3. **Set up DocClaim Agent** using:\n   - GPT-4o or any LLM with document analysis capability\n   - Output parser for standardizing extracted receipt data (e.g., vendor, total, tax, date)\n\n4. **Transform extracted data** into a structured claim record (Code Node).\n\n5. **Path 1**: Save records to a Google Sheet (one row per expense).\n\n6. **Path 2**:\n   - Format the employee + claim data into a dynamic **HTML email**\n   - Use `Send Email` node to notify the finance department (e.g., `finance@yourcompany.com`)\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- n8n running with access to:\n  - Google Drive API (for file uploads)\n  - Google Sheets API (for logging expenses)\n  - Email node (SMTP or Gmail for sending)\n- GPT-4o or equivalent LLM with document parsing ability\n- PDF invoices with clear formatting\n- Shared Google Sheet for claim tracking\n- Optional: Shared inbox for finance team\n\n\n\n## 🧩 How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Add approval steps**: route the email to a manager before finance\n- **Attach original PDFs**: include uploaded files in the email as attachments\n- **Localize for other languages**: adapt form labels, email content, or parser prompts\n- **Sync to ERP or accounting system**: replace Google Sheet with QuickBooks, Xero, etc.\n- **Set limits/validation**: enforce max claim per trip or required fields before submission\n- **Auto-tag expenses**: add categories (e.g., travel, accommodation) for better reporting\n",
