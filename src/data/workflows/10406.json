  "description": "# 📬 SPAM MANAGER FOR LEAD GENERATION\n\nAutomatically identifies and manages spam replies from your outreach inbox; such as “Delivery failed” or “There was a problem with your delivery” which comes from \"mailer-daemon@googlemail.com\" for Gmail. This is to remove these messages to keep your email lists clean and improve domain reputation.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Who it’s for\n\nThis workflow is designed for **lead generation managers, outreach specialists, and freelancers** who send cold or automated emails at scale.\n\nIt helps you **automatically filter and manage bounce or spam responses** without manually combing through your inbox, ensuring your sender domain stays healthy and your lead lists remain accurate.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n\n1. **Trigger:** Watches your Gmail inbox for replies from system senders like `mailer-daemon@googlemail.com`.  \n2. **Extract Email:** Pulls out the email address from each bounce or spam message.  \n3. **Merge:** Compares the extracted address with your **main lead sheet**.  \n4. **Update Sheet:**  \n   - If the email exists in your main sheet, it updates that record’s **SPAM field** to `\"YES\"`.  \n   - Otherwise, it adds the address to a dedicated **Unsubscribe or Bad Emails table**.  \n5. **Mark as Read:** Tags and marks the email as processed in Gmail for better visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Requirements\n\nTo run this workflow, you’ll need:\n- **Gmail Credentials** → For reading and tagging emails.  \n- **NocoDB API Token** → For reading and updating your lead list and spam records.(You can use Sheets, Airtable or any other DB you use).  \n\nBoth can be securely added through the **n8n Credentials Manager**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How to Customize\n\n- **Sender Filter:** Change the Gmail Trigger to include other mailer domains or error messages.  \n- **Data Storage:** Replace NocoDB with Google Sheets or Airtable.  \n- **Tagging:** Adjust or remove the Gmail label used for spam-marked messages.  \n- **Message Matching:** Edit the `MERGE` code node to fit your column names (e.g., `Email`, `Address`, etc.).  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Why this workflow matters\n\nBy automating spam and bounce handling, you:\n- Keep your **lead database clean and current**  \n- Reduce bounce rates and spam flags  \n- Improve your **email deliverability and sender score**  \n- Save time spent manually checking failed emails  \n\n---\n\n## 🪄 Quick Setup Tips\n\n- Add your Gmail and DB credentials under the **Credentials tab**.  \n- Update the DB project and table IDs in relevant nodes.  \n- Test with a few known bounce messages to verify connection and matching.  \n- Optional: Add a “SPAM” tag in Gmail for quick inbox filtering. \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" is used in this workflow.  \n\n---\n\n\n## 🧾 Workflow Info\n\n**Workflow Name:** SPAM MANAGER FOR LEAD GENERATION  \n**Category:** Email & Data Hygiene  \n**Version:** 1.0  \n**Created for:** Outreach and CRM Automation  \n\n\n---\n\n**Author:** Itunu  \n**Portfolio:** [Itunu’s Automation Portfolio](https://github.com/E2nuu/itunu-automation-portfolio)",
