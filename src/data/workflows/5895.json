  "description": "Drowning in security alerts? Spending hours translating technical logs from Wazuh, your SIEM, or other tools into business-friendly reports for leadership? This n8n workflow is your automated Security Analyst, designed to save you time and bridge the communication gap between technical teams and non-technical executives.\n\nUsing a powerful **two-stage AI process** via the NixGuard Security RAG connector, this workflow transforms raw security event data into a concise, actionable daily briefing.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1.  **Stage 1: Intelligent Filtering & Data Structuring:** On a daily schedule, the workflow first calls the AI to sift through all recent security events. It intelligently identifies significant alerts and structures them into a clean, machine-readable JSON array, cutting through the noise.\n2.  **Stage 2: Executive Summarization:** If critical alerts are found, the workflow feeds this structured JSON into a second AI prompt. It tasks the AI to act as a Senior Security Analyst, generating a high-level summary that focuses on business impact, key threat patterns, and a clear, single recommendation—all in plain English.\n3.  **Automated Delivery:** The final Markdown report is automatically converted to HTML and emailed as a professional daily security briefing to your stakeholders.\n\n**Key Features & Benefits:**\n\n*   **Slash Reporting Time:** Automate the manual, time-consuming process of daily security analysis and reporting.\n*   **Bridge the Technical Gap:** Deliver clear, non-technical summaries that executives can understand and act upon instantly.\n*   **Reduce Alert Fatigue:** Let AI filter out the low-level noise and only escalate what truly matters.\n*   **Two-Stage AI Processing:** Leverage a sophisticated AI chain for more accurate and relevant results than a single prompt.\n*   **Highly Customizable:** Easily adapt the prompts, schedule, and data sources (any system compatible with the NixGuard RAG connector) to fit your exact needs.\n\n**Who is this for?**\n\n*   **Security Analysts, Engineers, and Managers** who need to automate daily reporting.\n*   **SecOps and DevOps Teams** looking to integrate security intelligence into their automated workflows.\n*   **IT Directors and VPs** who need to provide consistent security posture updates to leadership.\n*   Anyone responsible for communicating cybersecurity risk to non-technical stakeholders.\n\nStop copying and pasting logs.
