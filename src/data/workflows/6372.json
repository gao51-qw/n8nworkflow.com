The agent follows strict guidelines (e.g., skipping URLs, brand names, etc.).  \n   - The translated text is sent to the \"Translate Google Slides\" node, which replaces the original text in the presentation using the slide's `objectId` for targeting.  \n\n4. **Execution Flow**:  \n   - The workflow includes delays (\"Wait 10 sec\" and \"Wait 3 sec\") to manage API rate limits and ensure smooth execution.  \n   - The process repeats for each batch of slides until all content is translated.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Prerequisites**:  \n   - Ensure access to the source Google Slides presentation (specified by `fileId` in \"Duplicate presentation\").  \n   - Set up Google OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive and Slides (nodes reference credentials like \"Google Slides account\").  \n   - Configure the Google Gemini (PaLM) API credentials for the translation agent.  \n\n2. **Configuration**:  \n   - Update the `fileId` in the \"Duplicate presentation\" node to point to your source presentation.  \n   - Adjust the translation guidelines in the \"Translation expert\" node if needed (e.g., language pairs or exclusion rules).  \n   - Modify batch sizes or wait times (e.g., \"Wait 10 sec\") based on API constraints.  \n\n3. **Execution**:  \n   - Run the workflow manually or trigger it via the \"Execute Workflow\" node from another workflow.  \n   - Monitor progress in n8n’s execution log, as each slide is processed and translated sequentially.  \n\n4. **Output**:  \n   - The translated presentation is saved as a new file in Google Drive, with the filename including a timestamp (e.g., `NAME_PRESENTATION_{lang}_{timestamp}`).  \n\n*Note*: The workflow is currently inactive (`\"active\": false`); enable it after configuration.\n\n---\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
