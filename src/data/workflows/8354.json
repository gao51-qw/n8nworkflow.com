  "description": "## Tasks Briefing\n\nThis template posts a clean, Slack-ready **morning summary of your Google Tasks due today**. It fetches tasks, filters only those due “today” in your timezone, asks a local **LLM (via LangChain + Ollama)** to produce a short summary (no steps, just a concise brief), strips any hidden `&lt;think&gt;` blocks, and delivers the message to your chosen Slack channel.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Trigger at Morning (Cron)** – runs at **7:00 AM** (you can change the hour) to kick things off daily.\n2. **Get many tasks (Google Tasks node)** – pulls tasks from your selected Google Tasklist.\n3. **Code (Filter Due Today)** – normalizes dates to your timezone, keeps only tasks due today, and emits a fallback flag if none exist.\n4. **If** – routes:\n\n   * **True (has tasks)** → continues to the LLM summary path.\n   * **False (no tasks)** → sends a “No tasks due today” message to Slack.\n5. **Code (Build LLM Prompt)** – builds a compact, Markdown-only prompt for the model (no tool calls).\n6. **Basic LLM Chain (LangChain)** + **Ollama Model** – generates a short summary for Slack.\n7. **Code (Cleanup)** – removes any `&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;` content if the model includes it.\n8. **Send a message (Slack)** – posts the final brief to your Slack channel.\n\n## Required credentials\n\n* **Google Tasks OAuth2 API** – to read tasks from your Google Tasklist.\n* **Slack API** – to post the summary into a channel.\n* **Ollama** – local model endpoint (e.g., `qwen3:4b`); used by the LangChain LLM nodes.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Google Tasks credential**\n\n   * In Google Cloud Console: enable **Google Tasks API**, create an **OAuth Client (Web)**, and set the redirect URI shown by n8n.\n   * In n8n **Credentials**, add **Google Tasks OAuth2 API** with scope:\n\n     * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` (read/write) or\n     * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks.readonly` (read-only).\n   * In the **Get many tasks** node, select your credential and your **Tasklist**.\n\n2. **Slack credential & channel**\n\n   * In n8n **Credentials**, add **Slack API** (bot/user token with `chat:write`).\n   * In **Send a message** nodes, select your Slack credential and set the **Channel** (e.g., `#new-leads`).\n\n3. **Ollama model (LangChain)**\n\n   * Ensure **Ollama** is running on your host (default `http://localhost:11434`).\n   * Pull a model (e.g., `ollama pull qwen3:4b`) or use another supported model (`llama3:8b`, etc.).\n   * In **Ollama Model** node, select your **Ollama** credential and set the **model** name to match what you pulled.\n\n4. **Timezone & schedule**\n\n   * The **Cron** node is set to **7:00 AM**. Adjust as needed.\n   * The **Code (Filter Due Today)** node is configured for **Asia/Dhaka**; change the `TZ` constant if you prefer a different timezone.\n\n5. **(Optional) Cleanup safety**\n\n   * The template includes a **Code (Cleanup)** node that strips `&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;` blocks from model output. Keep this connected before the Slack node.\n\n6. **Test the flow**\n\n   * Run the workflow once manually:\n\n     * If you have tasks due today, you should see a concise summary posted to your Slack channel.\n     * If none are due, you’ll receive a friendly “No tasks due today” message.\n\n7. **Activate**\n\n   * When everything looks good, toggle the workflow **Active** to receive the daily summary automatically.\n\n",
