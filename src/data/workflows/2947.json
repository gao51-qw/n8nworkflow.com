  "description": "# Weather via Slack 🌦️💬\n\n## Overview\nThis workflow provides real-time weather updates via Slack using a **custom Slack command**:  \n`/weather [cityname]`\n\nUsers can type this command in Slack (e.g., `/weather New York`), and the workflow will fetch and post the latest forecast, including temperature, wind conditions, and a short weather summary.\n\nWhile this workflow is designed for Slack, users can modify it to send weather updates via **email, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or any other communication platform**.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Webhook Trigger** – The workflow is triggered when a user runs `/weather [cityname]` in Slack.\n2. **Geocoding with OpenStreetMap** – The city name is converted into latitude and longitude coordinates.\n3. **Weather Data from NOAA** – The coordinates are used to retrieve detailed weather data from the **National Weather Service (NWS)** API.\n4. **Formatted Weather Report** – The workflow extracts relevant weather details, such as:\n   - Temperature (°F/°C)\n   - Wind speed and direction\n   - Short forecast summary\n5. **Slack Notification** – The weather forecast is posted back to the Slack channel in a structured format.\n\n## Requirements\n- A **custom Slack app** with:\n  - The ability to create a **Slash Command (`/weather`)**\n  - OAuth permissions to post messages in Slack\n- An **n8n instance** to host and execute the workflow\n\n## Customization\n- Replace Slack messaging with **email, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, or another service**.\n- Modify the weather data format for different output preferences.\n- Set up scheduled weather updates for specific locations.\n\n## Use Cases\n- Instantly check the weather for any location directly in Slack.\n- Automate weather reports for team members or projects.\n- Useful for remote teams, outdoor event planning, or general weather tracking.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. **Create a custom Slack app**:\n   - Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.\n   - Add a **Slash Command** (`/weather`) with the webhook URL from n8n.\n   - Enable OAuth scopes for sending messages.\n2. **Deploy the webhook** – Ensure it can receive and process Slack commands.\n3. **Run the workflow** – Type `/weather [cityname]` in Slack and receive instant weather updates.\n",
