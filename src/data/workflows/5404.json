  "description": "This automated n8n workflow qualifies B2B leads via voice calls using the VAPI API and integrates the collected data into Google Sheets. It triggers when a new lead’s phone number is added, streamlining lead qualification and data capture.\n\n## What is VAPI?\nVAPI is an API service that enables voice call automation, used here to qualify leads by capturing structured data through interactive calls.\n\n### Good to Know\n\n- VAPI API calls may incur costs based on usage; check VAPI pricing for details.\n- Ensure Google Sheets access is properly authorized to avoid data issues.\n- Use credential fields for the HTTP Request node 'Bearer token' instead of hardcoding.\n- Use a placeholder Google Sheet document ID (e.g., \"your-sheet-id-placeholder\") to avoid leaking private data.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Detect when a new phone number is added for a lead using the **New Lead Captured node**.\n2. Use the Receive Lead Details from **VAPI node** to capture structured data (name, company, challenges) via a POST request.\n3. Trigger an outbound VAPI call to qualify the lead with the **Initiate Voice Call (VAPI) node**.\n4. Store the collected data into a Google Sheet using the **Save Qualified Lead to CRM Sheet node**.\n5. Send a success response back to VAPI with the **Send Call Data Acknowledgement node**.\n\n### How to Use\n\n- Import the workflow into n8n.\n- Configure VAPI API credentials in the HTTP Request node using credential fields.\n- Set up Google Sheets API access and authorize the app.\n- Create a Google Sheet with the following columns: Name (text), Company (text), Challenges (text), Date (date).\n- Test with a sample lead phone number to verify call initiation and data storage.\n- Adjust the workflow as needed and retest.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. VAPI API credentials\n2. Google Sheets API access\n\n### Customizing This Workflow\nModify the Receive Lead Details from VAPI node to capture additional lead fields or adjust call scripts for specific industries.",
