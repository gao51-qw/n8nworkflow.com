  "description": "## Overview\nThis n8n workflow automatically converts and enhances multiple photos into professional ID-style portraits using Gemini AI (Nano Banana). It processes images in batch from Google Drive, applies professional ID photo standards (proper framing, neutral background, professional attire), and outputs the enhanced photos back to Google Drive.\n\n**Input:** Google Drive folder with photos  \n**Output:** Professional ID-style portraits in Google Drive output folder\n\nThe workflow uses a simple form interface where users provide Google Drive folder URLs and an optional custom prompt. It automatically fetches all images from the input folder, processes each through the Defapi API with Google's **nano-banana** model, monitors generation status, and uploads finished photos to the output folder. Perfect for HR departments, recruitment agencies, or anyone needing professional ID photos in bulk.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- A Defapi account and API key (Bearer token configured in n8n credentials): Sign up at [Defapi.org](https://defapi.org)\n- An active n8n instance with Google Drive integration\n- Google Drive account with two **public** folders:\n  - **Input folder**: Contains photos to be processed (must be set to public/anyone with the link)\n  - **Output folder**: Where enhanced photos will be saved (must be set to public/anyone with the link)\n- Photos with clear faces (headshots or upper body shots work best)\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. Prepare Google Drive Folders\n- Create two Google Drive folders:\n  - One for input photos (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/xxxxxxx`)\n  - One for output photos (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/yyyyyy`)\n- **Important**: Make both folders **public** (set sharing to \"Anyone with the link can view\")\n  - Right-click folder → Share → Change \"Restricted\" to \"Anyone with the link\"\n- Upload photos to the input folder (supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`)\n\n### 2. Configure n8n Credentials\n- **Defapi API**: Add HTTP Bearer Auth credential with your Defapi API token (credential name: \"Defapi account\")\n- **Google Drive**: Connect your Google Drive OAuth2 account (credential name: \"Google Drive account\"). See https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-generic/\n\n### 3. Run the Workflow\n- Execute the workflow in n8n\n- Access the form submission URL\n- Fill in the form:\n  - **Google Drive - Input Folder URL**: Paste your input folder URL\n  - **Google Drive - Output Folder URL**: Paste your output folder URL  \n  - **Prompt** (optional): Customize the AI generation prompt or leave blank to use the default\n\n### 4. Monitor Progress\nThe workflow will:\n- Fetch all images from the input folder\n- Process each image through the AI model\n- Wait for generation to complete (checks every 10 seconds)\n- Download and upload enhanced photos to the output folder\n\n## Workflow Structure\nThe workflow consists of the following nodes:\n\n1. **On form submission** (Form Trigger) - Collects Google Drive folder URLs and optional prompt\n2. **Search files and folders** (Google Drive) - Retrieves all files from the input folder\n3. **Code in JavaScript** (Code Node) - Prepares image data and prompt for API request\n4. **Send Image Generation Request to Defapi.org API** (HTTP Request) - Submits generation request for each image\n5. **Wait for Image Processing Completion** (Wait Node) - Waits 10 seconds before checking status\n6. **Obtain the generated status** (HTTP Request) - Polls API for completion status\n7. **Check if Image Generation is Complete** (IF Node) - Checks if status is not \"pending\"\n8. **Format and Display Image Results** (Set Node) - Formats result with markdown and image URL\n9. **HTTP Request** (HTTP Request) - Downloads the generated image file\n10. **Upload file** (Google Drive) - Uploads the enhanced photo to the output folder\n\n## Default Prompt\nThe workflow uses this professional ID photo generation prompt by default:\n\n```\nCreate a professional portrait suitable for ID documentation with proper spacing and composition.\n\nFraming: Include the full head, complete shoulder area, and upper torso. Maintain generous margins around the subject without excessive cropping.\n\nOutfit: Transform the existing attire into light business-casual clothing appropriate for the individual's demographics and modern style standards. Ensure the replacement garment appears natural, properly tailored, and complements the subject's overall presentation (such as professional shirt, refined blouse, contemporary blazer, or sophisticated layered separates).\n\nPose & Gaze: Position shoulders square to the camera, maintaining perfect frontal alignment. Direct the gaze straight ahead into the lens at identical eye height, avoiding any angular deviation in vertical or horizontal planes.\n\nExpression: Display a professional neutral demeanor or subtle closed-lip smile that conveys confidence and authenticity.\n\nBackground: Utilize a solid, consistent light gray photographic background (color code: #d9d9d9) without any pattern, texture, or tonal variation.\n\nLighting & Quality: Apply balanced studio-quality illumination eliminating harsh contrast or reflective artifacts. Deliver maximum resolution imagery with precise focus and accurate natural skin color reproduction.\n```\n\n## Customization Tips for Different ID Photo Types\n\nBased on the default prompt structure, here are specific customization points for different use cases:\n\n### 1. **Passport & Visa Photos**\n**Key Requirements**: Most countries require white or light-colored backgrounds, neutral expression, no smile.\n\n**Prompt Modifications**:\n- **Background**: Change to `Plain white background (#ffffff)` or `Light cream background (#f5f5f5)`\n- **Expression**: Change to `Completely neutral expression, no smile, mouth closed, serious but not tense`\n- **Framing**: Add `Head size should be 70-80% of the frame height.
