  "description": "# Extracting Comments from an X Post\n\n## Use Case\nEngaging with conversations on X (formerly Twitter) is critical for brands and individuals monitoring sentiment, leads, or emerging trends. Manually collecting comments is time-consuming—this automation enables scalable extraction of comment data to inform your outreach or analysis.\n\n## What This Automation Does\nThis automation extracts comments from a specified X post, with the following input parameters:\n\n- **`airtop_profile`**: The name of your [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to X.\n- **`x_post_url`**: The URL of the X post to extract comments from.\n- **`max_number_of_comments`**: The maximum number of comments to retrieve.\n\n## How It Works\n1. Takes input via a form or another workflow.\n2. Normalizes the input values.\n3. Creates a new browser session using Airtop.\n4. Navigates to the provided X post.\n5. Uses a prompt to extract up to the specified number of comments, returning:\n   - Author name\n   - Author profile URL\n   - Comment text\n\n## Setup Requirements\n1. [Airtop API Key](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys) — free to generate.\n2. An [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to X (requires one-time login).\n\n## Next Steps\n- **Pair with X Monitoring**: Use this with the [X monitoring automation](https://www.airtop.ai/blog/automating-x-monitoring-with-airtop-and-make) to detect relevant posts and extract discussion context automatically.\n- **Feed into Analytics**: Combine with summarization or sentiment analysis tools to understand audience response at scale.\n- **Export for CRM/BI**: Pipe the structured comment data into your CRM or business intelligence stack for lead tracking or reporting.\n\nRead more about [Extracting Comments from X Posts](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/extract-x-post-comments-n8n)\n",
