This makes it easier to visualize and do other SEO related tasks and activities without having to log into Search Console\n\n## Setup and use\n\n1. Set your desired schedule\n2. Enter your desired domain\n3. Connect to your Google sheets or make a copy of this sheet. \n\n## Detailed Setup\n\n- **Inputs and Outputs:**\n- Input: API response from Google Search Console regarding keywords, page data, and date data.\n- Output: Entries written to Google Sheets containing keyword data, clicks, impressions, CTR, and positions.\n\n2. **Setup Instructions:**\n- **Prerequisites:**\n- An n8n instance set up and running.\n- Active Google Account with access to Google Search Console and Google Sheets.\n- Google OAuth 2.0 credentials for API access.\n\n- **Step-by-Step Setup:**\n1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.\n2. Add the nodes as described in the JSON.\n3. Configure the **Google OAuth2** credentials in n8n to enable API access.\n4. Set your domain in the **Set your domain** node.\n5. Customize the Google Sheets document URLs to your personal sheets.\n6. Adjust the schedule in the **Schedule Trigger** node as per your requirements.\n7.
