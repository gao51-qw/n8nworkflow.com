Tasks are analyzed to generate structured summaries, productivity metrics, and KPI scores. JavaScript logic refines and standardizes the results. The final performance data is stored in Google Sheets as a live KPI dashboard.\n\n## Step-by-step  \n- **Step 1: Collect ClickUp task data**  \n  - **Schedule Trigger** – Starts the workflow automatically at defined intervals.  \n  - **Get many folders** – Fetches all folders from the selected ClickUp space.  \n  - **Loop Over Items** – Iterates through folders to process tasks sequentially.  \n  - **Get many tasks** – Retrieves tasks associated with each folder or list.  \n\n- **Step 2: Analyze tasks and compute KPIs**  \n  - **Message a model** – Sends task details to an AI model to generate summaries and raw performance metrics.  \n  - **Code in JavaScript** – Parses AI output, recalculates KPI scores, and assigns standardized ratings.  \n\n- **Step 3: Update employee KPI dashboard**  \n  - **Append or update row in sheet** – Writes or updates task and employee performance data in Google Sheets.  \n\n## Why use this?  \n- Automates employee performance tracking without manual reporting.  \n- Produces consistent KPI scores across all ClickUp tasks.  \n- Helps managers quickly identify overdue or high-priority work.  \n- Keeps Google Sheets dashboards continuously up to date.  \n- Improves visibility into productivity and task execution trends.  \n",
