  "description": "## Try It Out!\n\n🚀 Reddit Crypto Intelligence & Market Spike Detector\n\n⸻\n\n🧠\nWorkflow Description\n\nReddit Crypto Intelligence & Market Spike Detector is an automated market sentiment and price-monitoring workflow that connects social chatter with real-time crypto price analytics.\nIt continuously scans new posts from r/CryptoCurrency, extracts recently mentioned coins, checks live price movements via CoinGecko, and alerts you on Discord when a significant spike or drop occurs.\n\nThis automation empowers traders, analysts, and communities to spot early market trends before they become mainstream — all using free APIs and open data.\n\n⸻\n\n⚙️\nHow It Works\n\n1. Monitor Reddit Activity\n\n◦ Automatically fetches the latest posts from r/CryptoCurrency using Reddit’s free RSS feed.\n◦ Captures trending titles, post timestamps, and mentions of coins or tokens (e.g., $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $PEPE).\n\n2. Extract Coin Mentions\n\n◦ A Code Node parses the feed using regex (\\$[A-Za-z0-9]{2,10}) to identify any symbols or tickers discussed.\n◦ Removes duplicates and normalizes all results for accurate data mapping.\n\n3. Fetch Market Data\n\n◦ Each detected coin symbol is matched with CoinGecko’s public API to fetch live market data, including current price, market rank, and 24-hour price change.\n◦ No API key required — completely free and reliable source.\n\n4. Detect Market Movement\n\n◦ A second Code Node filters the fetched data to identify price movements greater than ±5% within the last 24 hours.\n◦ This helps isolate meaningful market action from routine fluctuations.\n\n5. Generate and Send Alerts\n\n◦ When a spike or dip is detected, the workflow composes a rich alert message including:\n▪ 💎 Coin name and symbol\n▪ 💰 Current price\n▪ 📈 24h percentage change\n▪ 🕒 Timestamp of detection\n◦ The message is sent automatically to your Discord channel using a preconfigured webhook.\n\n⸻\n\n💬\nExample Output\n\n🚨 Crypto Reddit Mention & Price Spike Alert! 🚨\n\n💎 ETHEREUM (ETH)\n💰 $3,945.23\n📈 Change: +6.12%\n\n💎 SOLANA (SOL)\n💰 $145.88\n📈 Change: +8.47%\n\n🕒 Checked at: 2025-10-31T15:00:00Z\n\nIf no coins cross the ±5% threshold:\n\n“No price spikes detected in the latest Reddit check.”\n\n🔔 #MarketIntel #CryptoSentiment #PriceAlert\n\n⸻\n\n🪄\nKey Features\n\n• 🧠 Social + Market Intelligence – Combines Reddit sentiment with live market data to detect potential early signals.\n• 🔎 Automated Coin Detection – Dynamically identifies newly discussed tokens from live posts.\n• 📊 Smart Spike Filtering – Highlights only meaningful movements above configurable thresholds.\n• 💬 Discord Alerts – Delivers clear, structured, and timestamped alerts to your community automatically.\n• ⚙️ Fully No-Cost Stack – Utilizes free Reddit and CoinGecko APIs with no authentication required.\n\n⸻\n\n🧩\nUse Cases\n\n• Crypto Traders: Detect early hype or momentum shifts driven by social chatter.\n• Analysts: Automate social sentiment tracking tied directly to live market metrics.\n• Community Managers: Keep members informed about trending coins automatically.\n• Bots & AI Assistants: Integrate this logic to enhance automated trading signals or alpha alerts.\n\n⸻\n\n🧰\nRequired Setup\n\n• Discord Webhook URL – For automatic alert posting.\n• (Optional) CoinGecko API endpoint (no API key required).\n• n8n Instance – Self-hosted or Cloud; free tier is sufficient.\n• Workflow Schedule – Recommended: hourly (Cron Node interval = 1 hour).\n\n⸻\n\nAFK Crypto Website: afkcrypto.com",
