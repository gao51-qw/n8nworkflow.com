  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow automatically monitors your Gmail inbox and uses OpenAI's GPT model to intelligently classify incoming emails into four key categories:\n - High Priority - Urgent emails requiring immediate attention from executives, clients, or stakeholders\n - Promotion - Marketing emails, sales offers, product launches, and event invitations\n - Finance/Billing - Invoices, receipts, payment notifications, and financial records\n - Customer Support - Help requests, troubleshooting queries, and service-related issues\n  \nOnce classified, emails are automatically labeled in Gmail using the appropriate tags, making it easy to filter, search, and prioritize your communications.\n\n## How to set up\n### Requirements\n - Gmail account with OAuth2 access enabled\n - OpenAI API key with GPT model access\n - Custom Gmail labels created for each category\n\n### Step-by-step setup\n 1. Create Gmail Labels\n  - In Gmail, create these labels: \"High Priority\", \"Promotion\", \"Finance/Billing\", \"Customer Support\"\n  - Note the label IDs (you'll need to replace the hardcoded ones in the workflow)\n 2. Configure Credentials\n  - Add your Gmail OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n  - Add your OpenAI API credentials\n 3. Update Label IDs\n  - Replace the hardcoded label IDs in each Gmail node with your actual label IDs\n  - You can find label IDs by testing the Gmail node or using Gmail API\n 4. Adjust Classification Rules\n  - Review the Text Classifier categories and modify descriptions to match your specific needs\n  - Add or remove categories as required\n 5. Set Polling Frequency\n  - The workflow is set to check every minute - adjust based on your email volume\n",
