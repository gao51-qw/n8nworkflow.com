  "description": "# 🚀 Auto-Save Instagram Leads to Google Sheets\n\nThis workflow automatically captures leads submitted through an Instagram Form and saves the data directly to a Google Sheet. It ensures that every new lead is instantly logged, creating a centralized database for your marketing and sales teams.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Receive Lead Data**  \n   The workflow starts with an **Instagram Lead Webhook** that listens for new lead submissions from your Instagram account's lead form.\n\n2. **Normalize Data**  \n   A **Code node** processes the raw data received from Instagram. This node normalizes the lead information, such as name, email, and phone number, into a consistent format. It also adds a **\"Source\"** field to identify the lead as coming from Instagram and timestamps the entry.\n\n3. **Save to Google Sheets**  \n   Finally, the **Save to Google Sheets node** takes the normalized data and appends it as a new row in your designated Google Sheet. It uses the email field to check for existing entries and can either append a new row or update an existing one, preventing duplicate data.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Create Google Sheet\n- Create a new Google Sheet with the following headers in the first row (A1):  \n\n### 2. Get Sheet ID\n- Find your **Sheet ID** in the URL of your Google Sheet.  \n- It's the long string of characters between `/d/` and `/edit`.  \n- Example:  \n- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in the **Save to Google Sheets** node with your actual ID.\n\n### 3. Connect Instagram Form\n- Copy the **Webhook URL** from the \"Instagram Lead Webhook\" node.  \n- In your Instagram lead form settings, paste this URL as the webhook destination.  \n- Ensure your form fields are mapped correctly (e.g., **name, email, phone, message**).\n\n---\n✅ Once configured, every Instagram lead will instantly appear in your Google Sheet — organized, timestamped, and ready for follow-up.\n",
