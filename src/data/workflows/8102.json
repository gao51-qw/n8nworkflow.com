This workflow solves those issues by:\n\n* **Automating project creation** from initial concept to fully structured ClickUp project with tasks and subtasks\n* **Standardizing task breakdown** using AI to generate professional Agile user stories with proper descriptions\n* **Eliminating manual setup** while ensuring consistency across all projects and teams\n* **Improving project planning quality** through AI-driven task analysis and structured output\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow transforms raw project ideas into complete, professional ClickUp projects with AI-generated task breakdowns and subtasks, following Agile best practices.\n\n**Step by step:**\n1. **Form Trigger** captures project details through a web form (Project Name and Full Features description)\n2. **Project Naming AI Agent** uses OpenAI to clean up project names, create professional descriptions, and generate random Jira-style project keys\n3. **ClickUp Create List** establishes the main project list in your ClickUp workspace\n4. **Task Generator AI Agent** analyzes project features and creates detailed task breakdown following Agile user story format\n5. **Split Out** breaks down the AI-generated task array into individual items for processing\n6. **Loop Over Items** processes each main task individually through batch processing\n7. **ClickUp Create Task** creates each main task with descriptions in the project list\n8. **Split Out Subtasks** extracts subtasks from each main task for individual processing\n9. **Execute Sub-workflow** triggers the subtask creation workflow to build parent-child task relationships\n10. **Gmail Notification** sends success notification email with project link and list ID\n11. **Sub-workflow Loop** handles individual subtask creation in ClickUp with proper parent task relationships\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Connect your OpenAI account** by adding your API key to the OpenAI Chat Model node for AI-powered project analysis\n2. **Configure ClickUp credentials** by adding your ClickUp API key and updating team ID and space ID for your workspace\n3. **Set up Gmail OAuth2** credential for sending notification emails\n4. **Update email recipient** in the Gmail node from the placeholder email to your actual email address\n5. **Configure the Execute Workflow node** to reference the correct sub-workflow ID for subtask creation\n6. **Customize the form fields** in the Form Trigger node based on your project input requirements\n7. **Test the workflow** with a sample project to ensure proper task generation and ClickUp integration\n8. **Verify notifications** are being sent correctly with proper project links\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n* **Modify task generation prompts**: adjust the AI prompts in the Task Generator node to match your specific project methodology or industry requirements\n* **Add custom fields**: enhance the form trigger with additional project metadata fields like priority, team assignment, or project type\n* **Switch AI models**: replace the OpenAI Chat Model node with other AI providers like Google Gemini, Claude, or local models by using the appropriate n8n AI nodes for different cost and performance requirements\n\n## Need help customizing?\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**  ",
