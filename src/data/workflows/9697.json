Healthcare Organizations: Compliance-critical offboarding with HIPAA and patient data access\n4. Financial Services: Regulated industries requiring audit trails and secure access revocation\n5. Professional Services: Knowledge-intensive businesses where brain drain is costly\n6. Retail & Hospitality: High-turnover environments needing efficient, consistent offboarding\n7. Remote-First Companies: Distributed teams requiring coordinated equipment recovery\n\n## What You'll Need\nRequired Integrations\n\n1. Jotform - Exit interview and resignation form (free tier works)\nCreate your form for free on [Jotform using this link](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=mediajade)\n\n2. OpenAI API - GPT-4 for AI exit interview analysis (~$0.20-0.50 per exit interview)\n\n3. Gmail - Automated notifications to employees, managers, IT, and HR\n\n4. Google Sheets - Exit interview database and retention analytics\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Import Template - Copy JSON and import into n8n\n2. Add OpenAI Credentials - Set up OpenAI API key (GPT-4 for best insights)\n3. Create Jotform Exit Interview - Build comprehensive form with these sections:\n4. Configure Gmail - Add Gmail OAuth2 credentials\n5. Setup Google Sheets:\nCreate spreadsheet with \"Exit_Interviews\" sheet\nReplace YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID in workflow\nColumns will auto-populate on first submission\n\n## Customization Options\n\n1. AI Prompt Refinement: Tailor analysis for your industry, company culture, and specific concerns\n2. Red Flag Categories: Customize what constitutes a red flag for your organization\nEquipment Types: Add specialized equipment (tools, uniforms, parking passes)\n3. Access Systems: Integrate with your specific IT systems for automated revocation\nKnowledge Transfer Templates: Create role-specific handover checklists\n4. Manager Notifications: Add more details based on department or seniority\n5. Exit Interview Questions: Add industry-specific or company-specific questions\n6. Retention Focus Areas: Adjust AI to focus on specific retention priorities\n7. Rehire Workflows: Add automatic alumni network invitations for boomerang candidates\n8.

Zero security breaches from lingering access - automated revocation on last day\n2. 100% equipment recovery - automated tracking and follow-up\n3. 3x faster offboarding - 30 minutes vs 2 hours of manual coordination\n4. 85% actionable insights from exit interviews vs 20% with manual reviews\n5. 60% improvement in identifying preventable turnover\n6. 90% manager compliance with knowledge transfer (vs 40% manual)\n7. 50% reduction in repeat management issues through coaching identification\n8. 40% increase in boomerang rehires through positive offboarding experience\n9. Complete audit trail for legal compliance and investigations\n10. Department-level insights identifying systemic retention issues\n\n## Use Cases\n1. Tech Startup (100 Employees, High Growth)\nEngineer resigns to join competitor. AI detects compensation issue (40% below market), flags manager micromanagement concerns, and identifies preventable departure (preventability: 85%). HR immediately initiates compensation review for engineering team, schedules manager coaching, and retains 3 other engineers considering leaving. Access to codebase revoked automatically on last day. Boomerang probability: 70% - maintains relationship for future recruiting.\n2. Healthcare System (500 Nurses)\nNurse leaves citing burnout. AI identifies systemic staffing issues in ER department affecting 15% of departures. Flags potential HIPAA violation concern requiring investigation. Automatically revokes EHR access on final day. Equipment recovery (badge, pager, scrubs) tracked with 100% success. Exit insights lead to ER staffing model changes, reducing nurse turnover by 30%.\n3. Financial Services Firm\nCompliance officer departs. AI red flags potential ethics concern requiring immediate investigation. Legal team notified within minutes. Knowledge transfer flagged as \"critical risk\" due to regulatory expertise. Detailed 30-day handover plan auto-generated. All system access revoked immediately. Complete audit trail maintained for regulatory review. Investigation reveals process gap, not ethical issue, preventing regulatory exposure.\n4. Retail Chain (2,000 Employees)\nStore manager exits. AI aggregates insights across 50 recent retail departures, identifying district manager as common thread (manager rating consistently 2/5). Regional HR intervenes with district manager coaching. Equipment return (keys, registers codes, uniforms) automated via checklist. 95% equipment recovery vs previous 60%. Sentiment trends show seasonal staff prefer flexible scheduling - policy updated chain-wide.\nRemote Software Company\n5. Developer in different timezone resigns. Automated offboarding coordinates across 3 time zones: access revoked at EOD local time, equipment return label emailed internationally, knowledge transfer scheduled with overlap hours. AI detects \"career growth\" as preventable issue - company implements career ladder framework, reducing senior developer attrition by 45%.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1. Timing Matters: Send Jotform link 1 week before last day for honest feedback (not on exit day)\n2. Anonymity Option: Consider anonymous feedback for more candid responses (separate form)\n3. Benchmark Scoring: After 50+ exits, calculate your company's average preventability score\n4. Manager Patterns: Track exits by manager to identify coaching needs early\n5. Department Trends: Monthly reviews of AI insights by department for systemic issues\n6. Compensation Data: Cross-reference \"compensation issue\" flags with market data\n7. Boomerang Program: Create formal alumni network for high-probability boomerang candidates\n8. Equipment Deposits: Consider requiring deposits for easier equipment recovery\n9. Exit Interview Training: Train managers on how to act on AI insights constructively\n10. Legal Review: Have legal team review red flag escalation categories quarterly\n11. Continuous Improvement: Use AI recommendations to create quarterly retention action plans\n12. Stay Interviews: Use exit interview insights to inform \"stay interview\" questions for current employees\n\n## Learning Resources\nThis workflow demonstrates advanced n8n automation patterns:\n\n1. AI Agents with complex structured output for multi-dimensional analysis,\nSentiment analysis and natural language processing\n2. Conditional escalation based on severity and red flags\n3. Multi-stakeholder notifications with role-specific messaging\n4. Risk assessment algorithms for knowledge transfer and preventability\n5. Pattern recognition across qualitative feedback\n6.
