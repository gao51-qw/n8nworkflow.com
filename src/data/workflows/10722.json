  "description": "Streamline your recruitment process with AI-powered resume analysis that goes beyond keyword matching.\n\n## Overview\nThis workflow revolutionizes hiring by using specialized AI agents to intelligently analyze resumes for different positions. Unlike traditional ATS systems that rely on keyword matching, this solution provides deep, contextual analysis of candidate qualifications and automatically manages the entire screening process from application to response.\n### How it works\n\nApplication Submission - Candidates complete a form with personal details, select their desired position (ICT, Customer Care, Accounting, or HR), and upload their resume\nSecure Storage - Resumes are automatically saved to Google Drive for permanent record-keeping\nIntelligent Routing - A switch node classifies applications by position and routes them to specialized AI agents\nAI Analysis - Position-specific agents (each with customized prompts and guardrails) extract text from PDFs and rate candidates on a 1-10 scale with detailed commentary\nCRM Integration - All data (timestamp, candidate info, position, score, AI comments, resume link) flows into Google Sheets for easy tracking\nAutomated Response - A secondary workflow sends interview invitations to high-scoring candidates (7-10) and professional rejection emails to others (below 7)\n\n### Key Benefits\n✅ Contextual Analysis - AI understands skills and experience, not just keywords\n✅ Faster Hiring - Close applications once you have enough qualified candidates\n✅ No Expertise Required - HR teams don't need technical knowledge in every field\n✅ Fully Automated - From submission to interview invitation without manual intervention\n✅ Customizable - Adjust AI prompts and scoring criteria for each position\n✅ Transparent - All AI reasoning is logged for review\nSet up steps\nTime to set up: ~30-45 minutes\nPrerequisites:\n\nn8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\nGoogle Drive account\nGoogle Sheets account\nAI provider credentials (OpenAI, Anthropic, or compatible API)\nEmail service (Gmail, SMTP, or other n8n-supported service)\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\nImport the workflow into your n8n instance\nConnect your Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts\nConfigure your AI provider credentials in the agent nodes\nCustomize AI prompts for each position in the respective agent nodes (detailed instructions in sticky notes)\nSet up your email service credentials\nCustomize email templates for invitations and rejections\nTest with sample resumes for each position\nDeploy your application form and share the link\n\nDetailed configuration instructions are included in sticky notes within the workflow.\nUse Cases\n\nStartups scaling their team quickly\nHR departments handling high application volumes\nAgencies managing recruitment for multiple clients\nCompanies hiring for specialized technical roles\n\n### Customization Options\n\nAdjust scoring thresholds for each position\nModify AI evaluation criteria via prompts\nAdd additional positions with dedicated agents\nIntegrate with your existing HRIS or ATS\nAdd SMS notifications for candidates\n\n\n**Note:** This workflow includes two separate flows - the main screening workflow and an automated response workflow.
