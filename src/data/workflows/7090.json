  "description": "## Automatically Send Monthly Sales Reports from Square via Gmail\n\n## What It Does  \nThis workflow automatically connects to the Square API and generates a **monthly** sales summary report for all your Square locations. The report matches the figures displayed in **Square Dashboard &gt; Reports &gt; Sales Summary**.\n\nIt's designed to run monthly and pull the **previous month’s** sales into a CSV file, which is then sent to a manager/finance team for analysis.\n\nThis workflow builds on my previous template, which allows users to automatically pull data from the Square API into n8n for processing. (See here: https://n8n.io/workflows/6358)\n\n## Prerequisites  \nTo use this workflow, you'll need:\n- A Square API credential (configured as a Header Auth credential)\n- A Gmail credential\n\n## How to Set Up Square Credentials:  \n- Go to **Credentials &gt; Create New**  \n- Choose **Header Auth**  \n- Set the **Name** to `Authorization`  \n- Set the **Value** to your Square Access Token (e.g., `Bearer &lt;your-api-key&gt;`)\n\n## How It Works  \n1. **Trigger:** The workflow runs on the **1st of every month at 8:00 AM**  \n2. **Fetch Locations:** An HTTP request retrieves all Square locations linked to your account  \n3. **Fetch Orders:** For each location, an HTTP request pulls completed orders for the **previous calendar month**  \n4. **Filter Empty Locations:** Locations with no sales are ignored  \n5. **Aggregate Sales Data:** A Code node processes the order data and produces a summary identical to Square’s built-in Sales Summary report  \n6. **Create CSV File:** A CSV file is created containing the relevant data  \n7. **Send Email:** An email is sent using Gmail to the chosen third party  \n\n## Example Use Cases  \n- Automatically send monthly Square sales data to management for forecasting and planning  \n- Automatically send data to an external third party, such as a landlord or agent, who is paid via commission  \n- Automatically send data to a bookkeeper for entry into QuickBooks  \n\n## How to Use  \n- Configure both HTTP Request nodes to use your Square API credential  \n- Set the workflow to **Active** so it runs automatically  \n- Enter the email address of the person you want to send the report to and update the message body  \n- If you want to remove the n8n attribution, you can do so in the last node  \n\n## Customization Options  \n- Add pagination to handle locations with more than 1,000 orders per month\n- Adjust the date filters in the HTTP node to cover the full calendar month (e.g., use Luxon or JavaScript to calculate `start_date` and `end_date`)\n\n## Why It's Useful  \nThis workflow saves time, reduces manual report pulling from Square, and enables smarter automation around sales data — whether for operations, finance, or performance monitoring.",
