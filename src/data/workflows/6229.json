  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the generation of short news videos using the **HeyGen video API** and **RSS feeds** from a Bangla news source, *Prothom Alo*. It is ideal for content creators, media publishers, or developers who want to create daily video summaries from text-based news feeds using AI avatars.\n\nThe workflow reads the latest news summaries from an RSS feed and sends each item to the HeyGen API to create a video with a realistic avatar and voice narration. The resulting video is suitable for publishing on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* A [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com/) account with access to the API.\n* HeyGen API key (kept securely in your environment).\n* n8n (self-hosted or cloud instance).\n* Basic understanding of using HTTP request nodes in n8n.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Clone this Workflow** into your n8n instance.\n2. Replace the placeholder value in the `X-Api-Key` header with your **HeyGen API key**.\n3. Confirm the RSS feed URL is correct and live:\n   `https://prod-qt-images.s3.amazonaws.com/production/prothomalo-bangla/feed.xml`\n4. The HTTP Request body references `{{$json.summary}}` from each RSS item. Make sure this field exists.\n5. Run the workflow manually or configure a CRON trigger if you want to automate it.\n\n## Customization\n\n* **Avatar ID** and **Voice ID** can be changed in the `HTTP Request` body. Use your HeyGen dashboard to get available IDs.\n* Change the video **dimensions** (`1280x720`) to suit your platform’s requirements.\n* You can replace the RSS feed with any other news source that supports XML format.\n* Add nodes to upload the video to YouTube, Dropbox, etc., after generation.\n\n## What It Does\n\n* Triggers manually.\n* Reads an RSS feed.\n* Extracts summary from each news item.\n* Sends a request to HeyGen to generate a video.\n* Returns the video generation response.\n\n",
