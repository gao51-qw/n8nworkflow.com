  "description": "## 📋 Overview\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically converts your **Google Calendar events** for the current day into **Trello cards** every morning at 8 AM. It fetches all calendar events for the day, filters out routine events (like Lunch or Check email), and creates neatly formatted Trello cards with a predefined meeting notes template.\n\nPerfect for professionals who want to keep their daily meetings and tasks synced with their Trello board.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Key Features\n\n* 🕗 **Runs daily at 8 AM** (configurable via Cron node)\n* 📅 **Fetches all Google Calendar events** for the current day\n* 🚫 **Skips routine/repetitive events** (Lunch, Check email, etc.)\n* 🧩 **Creates Trello cards** with structured meeting notes\n* 🔗 **Includes event URL and due date** in Trello card\n* 🧠 **Customizable filters and templates** for full control\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Workflow Steps\n\n### 1. **Run Daily at 8 AM** (`Cron Node`)\n\nAutomatically triggers the workflow every morning at 8:00 AM. You can adjust the time as needed.\n\n### 2. **Calculate Today's Date Range** (`Function Node`)\n\nGenerates the ISO-formatted start and end times for the current day (00:00–23:59). These values are passed to the Google Calendar node for querying events.\n\n### 3. **Fetch All Today's Calendar Events** (`Google Calendar Node`)\n\nFetches all events scheduled for today using your Google account. The calendar email (`your-email@example.com`) should be replaced with your actual email.\n\n### 4. **Process Events One by One** (`SplitInBatches Node`)\n\nSplits the list of events into single items for individual processing.\n\n### 5. **Extract Event Details for Trello** (`Set Node`)\n\nMaps each event’s details (summary, description, start time, and URL) into structured fields ready for Trello card creation.\n\n### 6. **Filter Out Routine Events** (`If Node`)\n\nSkips over common recurring events (like “Check email,” “Lunch,” “Wrap Up & Clear Desk,” or “Beers and Griping”). You can customize this list as needed.\n\n### 7. **Create New Trello Card with Template** (`Trello Node`)\n\nFor non-filtered events, creates a new Trello card using a predefined meeting notes template. Includes:\n\n* Title: Event summary\n* Due date: Event start time\n* Description: Preformatted meeting notes layout\n* Source URL: Event link from Google Calendar\n\n### 8. **Skip Filtered Event** (`NoOp Node`)\n\nHandles skipped events gracefully without performing any action.\n\n---\n\n## 🧰 Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. **Add Credentials**\n\n* Add **Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials** in n8n.\n* Add **Trello API credentials** in n8n.\n\n### 2. **Replace Placeholder Values**\n\n* Update the calendar email in the **Google Calendar node**.\n* Add your **Trello board and list IDs** in the Trello node.\n\n### 3. **Optional Customizations**\n\n* Modify the **Cron node** to change trigger time.\n* Edit the **Trello card template** to match your meeting format.\n* Add labels using `idLabels` in the Trello node.\n* Adjust the **filter conditions** for different recurring tasks.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Example Use Case\n\nImagine you have daily meetings in your Google Calendar. Each morning, this workflow:\n\n1. Collects all your events for the day.\n2. Skips unimportant ones (like lunch breaks).\n3. Automatically adds Trello cards for real meetings, each with a structured template for you to take notes and assign next steps.\n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Example Trello Card Template\n\n**Title:** Meeting with Client A\n**Due Date:** 2025-11-11T10:00:00Z\n**Description:**\n\n```\n**Meeting purpose (*Integrations, Playbooks, UI Issues, Project*):**\n\n- Task\n\n**Next Steps (*Task, Assigned to, Checkpoint Date*):**\n\n- Task\n\n**Decisions Made (*What, Why, Impacts*):**\n\n- Task\n\n**Discussion (*Items/Knowledge Shared*):**\n\n- Task\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n* Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials\n* Trello API credentials\n* Active Google Calendar with events\n* A Trello board/list to create cards in\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Notes\n\n* You can adjust the workflow to run multiple times a day if needed.\n* You can integrate Slack or email notifications for newly created cards.\n* The workflow is lightweight and suitable for daily automation tasks.\n\n---\n\n**✨ Tip:** Combine this with n8n’s Slack or Notion integrations to get a full daily planning system that syncs your meetings, notes, and tasks automatically!\n",
