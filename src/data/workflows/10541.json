  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow automatically detects new image files uploaded to a Google Drive folder, extracts Japanese text using OCR, summarizes it with AI, and records the result in Google Sheets.  \nFinally, it sends a completion email notification with the file name and summary.\n\n**Workflow steps:**\n1. **Google Drive New File Trigger** – Watches a specific Google Drive folder for new image uploads.  \n2. **Download Image File** – Downloads the newly uploaded image for processing.  \n3. **Extract Text with OCR.space** – Sends the image to the OCR.space API to extract text (Japanese supported).  \n4. **Format OCR Result & Check for Empty** – Cleans and validates the extracted text.  \n5. **Generate Summary with OpenRouter AI** – Uses an AI model to generate a short summary of the text.  \n6. **OpenRouter Chat Model** – Connects the AI Agent to the OpenRouter language model.  \n7. **Append row in sheet** – Adds the file name, AI summary, and processing date to Google Sheets.  \n8. **Send Completion Notification via Gmail** – Sends an email with the summarized content and Google Sheets link.  \n9. **Process Completed** – Marks the workflow’s successful end.\n\n---\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Connect your **Google Drive**, **Google Sheets**, and **Gmail** accounts through credentials.  \n2. Set your **OCR.space API key** in the HTTP Request node.  \n3. Add your **OpenRouter API key** credential for the AI node.  \n4. Replace the **Google Sheet ID** and **folder ID** with your own.  \n5. Customize the **Gmail recipient** and email message as needed.  \n6. Adjust the **polling frequency** (e.g., every 1 minute) depending on your workflow needs.\n\n---\n\n## Ideal for\n- Digitizing and summarizing handwritten or printed book pages.  \n- Automatically extracting and archiving text from scanned reports or notes.  \n- Businesses or educators automating document reading and summarization tasks.\n\n---\n\n⚙️ **Note:**  \nEach node includes a clear **English Sticky Note** above it for easier understanding and documentation.\n",
