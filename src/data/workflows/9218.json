  "title": "Automate QuickBooks invoicing & customer creation from Airtable sales orders",
  "description": "## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete solution to automate your entire invoicing process. \n\nIt intelligently syncs confirmed sales orders from your Airtable base to QuickBooks, automatically creating new customers if they don't exist before generating a perfectly matched invoice. It then logs all invoice details back into Airtable, creating a flawless, end-to-end financial workflow.\n\n## Use Cases\n**1. Accounting & Finance Teams:**\n- Automatically generate QuickBooks invoices from new orders confirmed in Airtable.\n- Keep all invoices and customer details synced across systems in real time.\n\n**2. Sales & Operations Teams:**\n- Track order status and billing progress directly from Airtable without switching platforms.\n- Ensure every confirmed sale automatically triggers an invoice in QuickBooks.\n\n**3. Business Owners / Admins:**\n- Eliminate double-entry between Airtable and QuickBooks.\n- Maintain accurate, audit-ready financial records with minimal effort.\n\n## How it works\n\n**1. Trigger from Airtable:** The workflow starts instantly when a sales order is ready to be invoiced in your Airtable base (triggered via a webhook).\n\n**2. Check for Customer in QuickBooks:** It searches your QuickBooks account to see if the customer from the sales order already exists.\n\n**3. Create New Customer (If Needed):** If the customer is not found, it automatically creates a new customer record in QuickBooks using the details from your Airtable Customers table.\n\n**4. Create QuickBooks Invoice:** Using the correct customer record (either existing or newly created), it gathers all order line items from Airtable and generates a detailed invoice in QuickBooks.\n\n**5. Log Invoice Back to Airtable:** After the invoice is successfully created, the workflow updates your Airtable base by adding a new record to your Invoices & Payments table and updating the original Confirmed Orders record with the new QuickBooks Invoice ID, marking it as synced.\n\n## Key Requirements to Use This Template\n**1. n8n Instance:** An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).\n\n**2. Airtable Base:** An Airtable base on a \"Pro\" plan or higher with tables for Confirmed Orders, Customers, Order Lines, Product & Service, and Invoices & Payments. Field names must match those in the setup guide.\n\n**3. QuickBooks Online Account:** An active QuickBooks Online account with API access.\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n**Step 1: Import and Configure the n8n Workflow**\n- **Import Workflow:** In n8n, import the Client-Quickbook-Invoices-via-AirTable.json file.\n- **Get Webhook URL:** Click on the first node, \"Webhook\". Copy the \"Test URL\". Keep this n8n tab open.\n- **Configure Airtable Nodes:** There are six Airtable nodes. For each one, connect your Airtable credentials and select the correct Base and Table.\n- **Configure QuickBooks Nodes:** There are four QuickBooks-related nodes. For each one, connect your QuickBooks Online credentials.\n- **CRITICAL:** Click on the \"Create Invoice URL\" (HTTP Request) node. You must edit the URL and replace the placeholder number (9341455145770046) with your own QuickBooks Company ID. (Find this in your QuickBooks account settings under \"Billing & Subscription\").\n- **Save and Activate**: Click \"Save\", then toggle the workflow to \"Active\". After activating, copy the new \"Production URL\" from the Webhook node.\n\n## Customization Guide\n\nYou can adapt this template for various workflows by tweaking a few nodes:\n\n- **Use a different Airtable Base:** Update the Base ID and Table ID in all Airtable nodes (Get Orders Records, Get Customer Details, Get Products, etc.).\n- **Switch from Sandbox to Live QuickBooks:** Replace the Sandbox company ID and endpoint in the “Create Invoice URL” node with your production QuickBooks company ID.\n- **Add more invoice details:** Edit the Code and Parse in HTTP nodes to include additional fields (like Tax, Shipping, or Notes).\n- **Support multiple currencies:** Add a “Currency” field mapping in both Airtable and QuickBooks nodes.\n\n\n## Connect with us\n- Website: https://www.intuz.com/services\n- Email: getstarted@intuz.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuz\n- Get Started: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/intuz\n\n## For Custom Workflow Automation\nClick here- [Get Started](https://www.intuz.com/get-started)\n",
