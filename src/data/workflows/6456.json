The report matches the figures displayed in Square Dashboard &gt; Reports &gt; Sales Summary.\n\nIt's designed to run daily and pull the previous day's sales into a Google Sheet for easy analysis and reporting.\n\nThis workflow builds on my previous template, which allows users to automatically pull data from the Square API into N8N for processing. (See here: [https://n8n.io/workflows/6358](https://n8n.io/workflows/6358))\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo use this workflow, you'll need:\n- A Square API credential (configured as a Header Auth credential)\n- A Google Sheets credential\n\n## How to Set Up Square Credentials:\n- Go to **Credentials &gt; Create New**\n- Choose **Header Auth**\n- Set the **Name** to \"Authorization\"\n- Set the **Value** to your **Square Access Token** (e.g., Bearer &lt;your-api-key&gt;)\n\n## How It Works\n- Trigger – The workflow runs daily at 4:00 AM\n- Fetch Locations – An HTTP request retrieves all Square locations linked to your account\n- Fetch Orders – For each location, an HTTP request pulls completed orders for the specified report_date\n- Filter Empty Locations – Locations with no sales are ignored\n- Aggregate Sales Data – A Code node processes the order data and produces a summary identical to Square’s Sales Summary report\n- Append to Google Sheets – The data will automatically be appended to an existing Google sheet\n\n# Example Use Cases\n- Automatically store daily sales data in Google Sheets for analysis and historical tracking\n- Automatically create charts or visualizations from the imported data\n- Build weekly/monthly reports after running for multiple days\n- Quickly calculate commissions or rent payments based on sales volume\n\n## How to Use\n- Configure both HTTP Request nodes to use your Square API credential\n- Set the workflow to Active so it runs automatically\n- Select the Google Sheet you want to import data into, and map the data to your columns\n\n## Customization Options\n- Add pagination to handle locations with more than 1,000 orders per day\n- Expand the workflow to save or send the report output via other integrations (email, database, webhook, etc.)\n\n## Why It's Useful\nThis workflow saves time, reduces manual report pulling from Square, and enables smarter automation around sales data—whether for operations, finance, or performance monitoring.\n\n",
