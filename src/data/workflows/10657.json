  "description": "# Overview\n\nThis workflow helps you automatically collect verified business leads from Google Search using SerpAPI — no coding required.\nIt extracts company names, websites, emails, and phone numbers directly from search results and saves them into Google Sheets for easy follow-up or CRM import.\n\nPerfect for marketers, freelancers, and agencies who want real, usable leads fast — without manual scraping or paid databases.\n\n# How It Works\n\n- SerpAPI Node performs a Google search for your chosen keyword or niche.\n- Split Out Node separates each result for individual processing.\n- HTTP Request Node optionally visits each site for deeper data extraction.\n- Code Node filters, validates, and formats leads using smart parsing logic.\n- Google Sheets Node stores the final structured data automatically.\n- All steps include sticky notes with configuration help.\n\n# Setup Steps\n\n- Setup takes about 5–10 minutes:\n- Add your SerpAPI key (replace the placeholder).\n- Connect your Google Sheets account.\n- Update the search term (e.g., “Plumbers in New York”).\n- Run the workflow and watch leads populate your sheet in real time.",
