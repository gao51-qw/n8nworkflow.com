  "description": "This n8n automation connects your **[Typeform](https://typeform.cello.so/e2pbXQKsijA)** forms with **[Vapi AI](https://vapi.ai/?aff=onenode)**, allowing you to **immediately call new form respondents** with a personalized message from a Vapi AI assistant, as soon as a form submission is received.\n\n## 🧾 Requirements\n\n### Typeform\n- A [**Typeform**](https://typeform.cello.so/e2pbXQKsijA) account\n- Typeform **personal access token** and **credentials** enabled in n8n\n- A **Typeform form** published that includes a phone number field\n\n### Vapi\n- A [**Vapi**](https://vapi.ai/?aff=onenode) account with credit\n- A connected **phone number** to make calls\n- An **assistant** created and ready to make calls\n- Your **Vapi API key**\n\n### 🔗 Useful Links\n- [n8n Typeform Credentials Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/typeform/)\n- [Vapi Docs](https://docs.vapi.ai/)\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Breakdown\n\n### 1. **Trigger: Typeform Submission**\n- Triggered when a new response is submitted to your Typeform.\n- The form must include a phone number field.\n\n### 2. **Wait 2 Minutes**\n- Adds a short delay before proceeding.\n- Useful to ensure form data is fully synced or to give time for related automations.\n\n### 3. **Set Vapi Fields (Manual Step)**\n- Set the required fields for the Vapi API call:\n  - `phone number id` - connected in Vapi\n  - `assistant id` - the assistant enabled in the call\n  - `Vapi API key` - your secure API key\n\n### 4. **Start Outbound Vapi Call**\n- Sends a **POST** request to `https://api.vapi.ai/call`\n- Payload includes:\n  - Respondent’s phone number (from Typeform)\n  - Vapi assistant id\n  - Vapi phone number id to initiate the call\n\n---\n\n## ✏️ Template Customization Guidance\n\n### How to Adapt for Your Specific Needs\n\n- **Personalize the Call Content:**  \n  Include additional fields in your Typeform (e.g., first name, interest, location). In n8n, map these form fields into the payload sent to Vapi. Update your Vapi assistant’s prompt/script to reference these variables for a highly personalized experience.\n\n- **Conditional Call Logic:**  \n  Use n8n's logic nodes (e.g., IF, Switch) to, for example:  \n    - Only trigger calls if a respondent checks a checkbox (e.g., consent or interest).\n    - Use a different Vapi assistant or phone number based on responses (e.g., language preference or location).\n\n- **Advanced Routing:**  \n  Configure the workflow to choose different assistants, phone numbers, or call scripts based on the respondent’s answers. Store assistant IDs or numbers as environment variables or reference them from a lookup table for dynamic selection.\n\n---\n\n## 📞 Examples: Using Form Data to Personalize Calls\n\n- **Greeting by Name:**  \n  If your Typeform collects `first_name`, map it into the Vapi payload. Your assistant script can begin, \"Hi {{first_name}}, thanks for your interest in XYZ!\"\n\n- **Custom Message Based on Product Interest:**  \n  Add a `product_interest` field in Typeform. Pass its value to Vapi and have the assistant mention the product, e.g., “I see you’re interested in our Premium Plan…”\n\n- **Reference Appointment Times or Locations:**  \n  Collect `appointment_time` and/or `city` fields, and tailor the call to reconfirm booking details using these inputs.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Tips\n\n- **Call Not Triggering:**  \n  Ensure your Typeform webhook connection and credentials are correctly set up in n8n. Check that your workflow is active and the trigger node is configured for the correct form.\n\n- **Invalid Phone Number Format:**  \n  Vapi requires numbers in full international format (e.g., `+11234567890`). Use n8n expressions to clean or verify the incoming number if needed.\n\n- **Missing Data in the Call:**  \n  Confirm that additional fields (e.g., `first_name`) exist in the Typeform response and that your mapping in n8n matches the exact field names.\n\n- **Failed API Call:**  \n  Double-check your Vapi phone number id, assistant id, and API key. Use n8n’s execution logs to inspect the payload sent to Vapi for debugging.\n\n- **Duplicate Calls:**  \n  If your Typeform allows multiple submissions, add logic in n8n to check for and avoid duplicate calls, for example by maintaining a record of called numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 🙋‍♂️ Need Help?\n\nFeel free to contact us at [**1 Node**](https://1node.ai)\nGet instant access to a library of [**free resources**](https://1node.ai/resources) we created.\n",
