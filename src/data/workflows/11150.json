  "description": "## Overview\nThis template is ideal for photographers, graphic designers, and creative professionals who manage large volumes of visual assets. It is also perfect for Digital Asset Managers looking for a customizable, automated solution to organize files without manual tagging.\n\n## What it does\nWhen a new image is uploaded to a designated \"Inbox\" folder in Google Drive, the workflow performs the following actions:\n\n- **AI Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o to analyze the image content, generating a description, extracting dominant colors, and determining the category (e.g., Portrait vs. Landscape).\n- **Safety Check**: Runs an AI-based NSFW filter. If inappropriate content is detected, the process stops, and a warning is sent to Slack.\n- **Smart Sorting**: Automatically moves the file into the correct subfolder based on its category.\n- **Contextual Tagging**: Generates specific tags (e.g., \"smile, natural light\" for portraits) and updates the file metadata.\n- **Archiving**: Creates a comprehensive entry in a Notion Database with the image link, tags, and description.\n- **Notification**: Sends a success alert to Slack with a summary of the archived asset.\n\n## How to set up\nThis workflow is designed to be plug-and-play using a central configuration node.\n\n1. **Credentials**: Connect your Google Drive, OpenAI, Notion, and Slack accounts in n8n.\n2. **Set Variables**: Open the node named **\"Workflow Configuration\"**. Replace the placeholder IDs with your actual Folder IDs (for Inbox, Portraits, and Landscapes), Notion Database ID, and Slack Channel ID.\n3. **Prepare Notion**: Create a Database in Notion with the following properties:\n   - Category (Select)\n   - Description (Rich Text)\n   - Image URL (URL)\n   - Tags (Rich Text)\n   - Date (Date)\n\n## Requirements\n- **n8n Version**: 1.0 or later.\n- **OpenAI API**: Access to the **gpt-4o** model is recommended for accurate vision analysis.\n- **Google Drive**: A specific folder structure (Inbox, Portraits, Landscapes).\n- **Notion**: A dedicated database for the portfolio.\n- **Slack**: A channel for notifications.\n\n## How to customize\n- **Add Categories**: You can expand the \"Category Router\" (Switch node) to include more specific genres like \"Architecture,\" \"Macro,\" or \"Street,\" and add corresponding paths.\n- **Adjust Prompts**: Modify the system prompts in the AI nodes to change the language of the output or the style of the generated tags.\n- **Change Output**: Connect to Airtable or Excel instead of Notion if you prefer a different database system.",
