This is particularly noticeable during longer meetings!**\n\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow retrieves the Zoom meeting data from the last 24 hours. The transcript of the last meeting is then retrieved, processed, a summary is created using AI and sent to all participants by email.\nAI is then used to create tasks and follow-up appointments based on the content of the meeting.\n\nImportant: You need a Zoom Workspace Pro account and must have activated Cloud Recording/Transcripts!\n\nThis workflow has the following sequence:\n\n1. manual trigger (Can be replaced by a scheduled trigger or a webhook)\n2. retrieval of of Zoom meeting data\n3. filter the events of the last 24 hours\n4. retrieval of transcripts and extract of the text\n5. creating a meeting summary, format to html and send per mail\n6. create tasks and follow-up call (if discussed in the meeting) in ClickUp/Outlook (can be replaced by Gmail, Airtable, and so forth) via sub workflow\n\n### Requirements:\n- Zoom Workspace (via API and HTTP Request): [Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/zoom/)\n- Microsoft Outlook: [Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoft/)\n- ClickUp: [Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/clickup/)\n- AI API access (e.g. via OpenAI, Anthropic, Google or Ollama)\n- SMTP access data (for sending the mail)\n\nYou must set up the individual sub-workflows as separate workflows. Then set the “Execute workflow trigger” here. Then select the corresponding sub-workflow in the AI Agent Tools.\nYou can select the number of domains yourself. If the data queries are not required, simply delete the corresponding tool (e.g. “Analytics_Domain_5).\n\nFeel free to [contact me via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/friedemann-schuetz), if you have any questions!",
