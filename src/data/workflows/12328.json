  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow runs on a daily schedule to analyze all Closed–Lost deals from your CRM and uncover the true reason behind each loss. It uses AI to classify the primary loss category, generate a confidence-backed explanation, and then create a realistic re-engagement strategy for every deal. All insights are consolidated into leadership-ready email and Slack summaries. Every analyzed deal and revival plan is logged for long-term tracking and audits.\n\n## Step-by-step\n- **Trigger and fetch lost deals**\n  - **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at a defined time.\n  - **Get many deals** – Fetches all deal records from the CRM.\n  - **If** – Filters only deals marked as Closed–Lost.\n  - **Edit Fields** – Standardizes key deal attributes like amount, industry, owner, and loss reason.\n\n- **Analyze loss reasons and generate revival strategies**\n  - **Brief Explanation Creator** – Uses AI to identify the primary loss category with confidence.\n  - **Code in JavaScript** – Parses and normalizes AI loss analysis output.\n  - **Merge** – Combines deal data with loss insights.\n  - **Feedback Creator** – Generates a practical re-engagement strategy for each lost deal.\n  - **Code in JavaScript7** – Parses and safeguards revival strategy outputs.\n  - **Merge4** – Merges deal details, loss analysis, and revival strategy into one final dataset.\n\n- **Report, notify, and store results**\n  - **Code in JavaScript11** – Builds a consolidated HTML summary email.\n  - **Send a message4** – Sends the summary to stakeholders via email.\n  - **Code in JavaScript12** – Creates a structured Slack summary.\n  - **Send a message1** – Delivers insights to a Slack channel.\n  - **Code in JavaScript10** – Reconstructs final data with delivery status.\n  - **Append or update row in sheet** – Logs all results into Google Sheets for audit and tracking.\n\n## Why use this?\n- Turns lost deals into actionable learning instead of static CRM records  \n- Gives sales teams clear, realistic re-engagement plans without manual analysis  \n- Provides leadership with concise, decision-ready summaries  \n- Creates a historical database of loss reasons and revival outcomes  \n- Improves pipeline recovery while enforcing consistent sales intelligence\n",
