As long as the total is visible, AI can read it.\n\n#### 2. 📲 **Send It to WhatsApp**\nForward the photo to your **private WhatsApp number or group** (e.g., “My Receipts”).  \nNo new apps. No extra steps. Just the tool you already use every day.\n\n#### 3. 🤖 **AI “Sees” the Receipt (Using `vlmRun`)**\nThis is the magic moment.\n\nThe **Vision Language Model (VLM)** — the same AI tech behind GPT-4V — *looks at the image* and understands it like a human would.\n\nIt extracts:\n- 🏪 **Vendor** (e.g., Walmart, Shell, Etsy)\n- 📅 **Date** (even if handwritten!)\n- 💵 **Total Amount** and currency\n- 🧾 **Item type** (if visible)\n\nNo OCR errors. No manual typing. Just smart, accurate reading.\n\n#### 4. 🧹 **Auto-Categorize with Simple Logic**\nThe workflow uses a **Function node** to sort your spending:\n- “Walmart” → **Groceries**\n- “Shell” → **Fuel**\n- “Amazon” → **Online**\n- “Art Supply Co” → **Kids**\n- “Therapy” → **Self-Care**\n\nYou can customize these rules in plain English — no coding needed.  \nWant to track “Date Nights” or “Gifts”? Just add it.\n\n#### 5. 📊 **Save to Google Sheets — Your Living Expense Log**\nEvery receipt becomes a row in a clean, organized spreadsheet:\n| Date | Vendor | Amount | Category | Image Link |\n|------|--------|--------|----------|------------|\n| 2025-04-05 | Walmart | $87.42 | Groceries | [View] |\n\nYou can:\n- Add monthly totals\n- Create charts\n- Share with your partner or accountant\n- Export for taxes\n\nAnd because it’s in **Google Sheets**, it works on any device — no new software to learn.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Who Is This For?\n\n#### 👩‍👧 **Homemakers & Parents**\nYou’re managing a household budget with receipts flying everywhere.  \nThis helps you:\n- Track where the money goes\n- Stay within grocery limits\n- Show your partner you’ve got this\n- Feel *in control* — not overwhelmed\n\n#### 💼 **Solopreneurs & Digital Business Owners**\nYou’re building a business — not an accounting firm.  \nThis helps you:\n- Separate personal vs. business expenses\n- Build clean records for taxes\n- Reimburse yourself fairly\n- Look professional during audits\n\n#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Couples & Shared Households**\nNo more “Did you save that receipt?” fights.  \nBoth partners can send to the same WhatsApp group — and everything gets logged automatically.\n\n#### 📅 **Anyone Prepping for Tax Season**\nStart in January. By April, you’ll have a **complete, auditable expense history** — no scrambling, no stress.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Tech That Feels Human\n\nWe used **real-world tools** — not sci-fi promises.\n\n| Node | What It Does | Why It’s Perfect |\n|------|-------------|------------------|\n| `whatsAble` | Gets your receipt photo from WhatsApp | Mobile-first, no app download |\n| `vlmRun` | AI reads the image and extracts data | Cutting-edge, accurate, magical |\n| `function` | Auto-categorizes based on vendor | Simple logic, easy to customize |\n| `googleSheets` | Stores everything in a familiar format | Exportable, shareable, reliable |\n\nAnd yes — it works even if you’re not techy.  \nEvery step includes **colorful sticky notes** that explain:\n- What the node does\n- Why it matters\n- How to customize it\n\nYou don’t need to understand AI to use it.  \nYou just need to **snap and send**.\n\nIt’s like having a **mini financial advisor** — built by you, for you.\n\n---\n\n### 💬 Real Talk: This Isn’t Just About Receipts\n\nThis is about:\n- 🕊️ **Reducing mental load**\n- 📊 **Feeling financially seen**\n- 🛠️ **Using tech that serves you — not the other way around**\n- 💪 **Building systems that make you feel like you’re winning**\n\nYou don’t need perfection.  \nYou need a system that’s **simple, kind, and actually works**.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what **Snap & Save** is.\n\n---\n\n### ❓ FAQs\n\n**Do I need to be techy?**  \nNo. If you can take a photo and send it on WhatsApp, you can do this.\n\n**What if the AI misreads a receipt?**  \nYou’ll see it in the log — just edit the row.
