The idea is to automate the creation of a professional looking job posting.\n\nUse cases would be organizations who need to automate the creation of job postings. \n\n### How it Works\n\n* The trigger is a form that asks for job position, salary, office location, and responsiblities\n* When the form is posted, it kicks off the workflow's next steps\n* A Word document is downloaded from a Dropbox folder. This Word document is used as the template for the posting.\n* The Word document is converted to base64.\n* A call to Foxit's Document Generation endpoint includes the encoded Word document along with the form information.\n* The resulting PDF is downloaded and converted from base64 into binary.\n* At this point, the PDF is just there, but it could be emailed, sent to another workflow, etc.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* A Dropbox account. The workflow's first step points to a Word template. See our [doc gen](https://docs.developer-api.foxit.com/#document-generation-apis) APIs for information on how to craft the Word doc, but the easiest way is to copy text like so:\n\n```\nJob Position\nWe are pleased to announce the opening of a new job, {{ jobPosition }}. This job pays ${{ salary }} per year and is in our {{ office }} location. The details of this job are:\n\n{{ responsibilities }}\n```\n\n* Foxit developer account (https://developer-api.foxit.com)\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAs mentioned above, you could do anything with the resulting PDF when done.
