Manually analyzing salary ranges and job descriptions is tedious and error-prone.\n\nThis workflow solves the problem by:\n\n- Simulating user behavior using Bright Data MCP Client to bypass anti-scraping systems\n\n- Extracting structured, clean job data in Markdown format\n\n- Using OpenAI GPT-4o mini to analyze and extract precise salary details and refined job descriptions\n\n- Merging and formatting the result for easy consumption\n\n- Delivering final output via webhook, Google Sheets, or file system\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nComponents & Flow\n\n**Input Nodes**\n- job_search_url: The job listing or search result URL\n\n- job_role: The title or role being searched for (used in logging/formatting)\n\n**MCP Client Operations**\n- MCP Salary Data Extractor\n\n\t- Simulates browser behavior and scrapes salary-related content (if available)\n\n\t- MCP Job Description Extractor\n\nExtracts full job description as structured Markdown content\n\n**OpenAI GPT-4o mini Nodes**\n\nSalary Information Extractor\n\n- Uses GPT-4o mini to detect, clean, and standardize salary range data (if any)\n\nJob Description Refiner\n\n- Extracts role responsibilities, qualifications, and benefits from unstructured text\n\nCompany Information Extractor\n\n- Uses Bright Data MCP and GPT-4o mini to extract the company information\n\n**Merge Node**\n- Combines the refined job description and extracted salary information into a unified JSON response object\n\n**Aggregate node**\n- Aggregates the job description and salary information into a single JSON response object\n\n**Final Output Handling**\n\nThe output is handled in three different formats depending on your downstream needs:\n\n- **Save to Disk**\n\n\t-\tOutput stored with filename including timestamp and job role\n\n- **Google Sheet Update**\n\n\t- Adds a new row with job role, salary, summary, and link\n\n- **Webhook Notification**\n\n\t- Pushes merged response to an external system\n\n\n### Pre-conditions\n\n1. Knowledge of Model Context Protocol (MCP) is highly essential. Please read this blog post - [model-context-protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)\n2. You need to have the [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/) account and do the necessary setup as mentioned in the **Setup** section below.\n3. You need to have the Google Gemini API Key. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)\n3. You need to install the Bright Data MCP Server [@brightdata/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightdata/mcp)\n4. You need to install the [n8n-nodes-mcp](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp)\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Please make sure to setup n8n locally with MCP Servers by navigating to [n8n-nodes-mcp](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp)\n2. Please make sure to install the Bright Data MCP Server [@brightdata/mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightdata/mcp)  on your local machine.\n2. Sign up at [Bright Data](https://brightdata.com/).\n3. Navigate to Proxies & Scraping and create a new Web Unlocker zone by selecting Web Unlocker API under Scraping Solutions.\n4. Create a Web Unlocker proxy zone called mcp_unlocker on Bright Data control panel.\n5. In n8n, configure the OpenAi account credentials.\n6. In n8n, configure the credentials to connect with MCP Client (STDIO) account with the Bright Data MCP Server as shown below.\n\n![MCPClientAccount.png](fileId:1471)\n\nMake sure to copy the Bright Data API_TOKEN within the Environments textbox above as API_TOKEN=&lt;your-token&gt;\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n**Modify Input Source**\n\n- Change the job_search_url to point to any job board or aggregator\n\n- Customize job_role to reflect the type of jobs being analyzed\n\n**Tweak LLM Prompts (Optional)**\n\n- Refine GPT-4o mini prompts to extract additional fields like benefits, tech stacks, remote eligibility\n\n**Change Output Format**\n\n- Customize the merged object to output JSON, CSV, or Markdown based on downstream needs\n\n- Add additional destinations (e.g., Slack, Airtable, Notion) via n8n nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n",
