  "description": "## Translate and localize content using DeepL and GPT-4o-mini\n\nManaging high-quality translations across multiple languages often requires more than just machine translation; it requires cultural context and quality assurance. This workflow automates the entire pipeline, from initial translation to AI-driven quality scoring and cultural localization.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Content Teams:** To automate the first draft and review process for blog posts or documentation.\n- **Marketing Agencies:** To localize campaign copy for international markets quickly.\n- **Product Managers:** To manage UI/UX copy across different regions with consistent glossary support.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Content Intake:** A Webhook receives the source text and a list of target languages.\n2. **Language Detection & Validation:** The workflow identifies the source language and validates the requested target codes.\n3. **Parallel Processing:** Using the **Split Out** node, the workflow processes each target language simultaneously.\n4. **DeepL Translation:** High-quality neural machine translation is performed for each language.\n5. **AI Quality Review:** **GPT-4o-mini** acts as a professional linguist, scoring the translation on accuracy, fluency, and style, and flagging any issues.\n6. **Cultural Localization:** A specialized node applies region-specific formatting for dates and currencies.\n7. **Aggregation & Reporting:** All results are unified, logged to **Google Sheets**, emailed via **Gmail**, and returned as a JSON response to the initial requester.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Credentials:** Connect your DeepL API, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Gmail accounts.\n2. **Google Sheets:** Create a sheet with headers: `Job ID`, `Source Text`, `Languages`, `Avg Quality`, and `Completed`. Paste the Sheet ID into the Google Sheets node.\n3. **Webhook:** Use the production URL in your CMS or app to trigger the workflow with a POST request.\n\n## Requirements\n- **DeepL API Key** (Free or Pro)\n- **OpenAI API Key** (for GPT-4o-mini)\n- **Google Account** (for Sheets and Gmail)\n\n## How to customize\n- **Adjust AI Rubric:** Modify the \"AI Quality Review\" prompt to focus on specific brand voice guidelines or technical terminology.\n- **Glossary Support:** Update the DeepL node to include specific Glossary IDs for industry-specific jargon.\n- **Localization Rules:** Add more regions or specific formatting rules (like measurement conversions) in the \"Apply Localization\" Code node.",
