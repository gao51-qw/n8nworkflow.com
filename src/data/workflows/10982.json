  "description": "*Tags: Image Compression, Tinify API, TinyPNG, SEO Optimisation, E-commerce, Marketing*\n\n### Context\n\nHi! I’m [Samir Saci](https://samirsaci.com), Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).\n\nI built this workflow for an agency specialising in e-commerce to automate the daily compression of their images stored in a Google Drive folder.\n\n[![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-23.png)](https://youtu.be/qXQVcaJgwrA)\n\nThis is particularly useful when managing large libraries of product photos, website assets or marketing visuals that need to stay lightweight for **SEO**, **website performance** or **storage optimisation**.\n\n&gt; Test this workflow with the free tier of the API!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis template is designed for:\n\n- **E-commerce managers** who need to keep product images optimised  \n- **Marketing teams** handling large volumes of visuals  \n- **Website owners** wanting automatic image compression for SEO  \n- **Anyone using Google Drive** to store images that gradually become too heavy  \n\n### What does this workflow do?\n\nThis workflow acts as an **automated image compressor and reporting system** using Tinify, Google Drive, and Gmail.\n\n1. Runs **every day at 08:00** using a Schedule Trigger  \n2. Fetches all images from the Google Drive **Input** folder  \n3. Downloads each file and sends it to the **Tinify API** for compression  \n4. Downloads the optimised image and saves it to the **Compressed** folder  \n5. Moves the original file to the **Original Images** archive  \n6. Logs: `fileName`, `originalSize`, `compressedSize`, `imageId`, `outputUrl` and `processingId` into a **Data Table**  \n7. After processing, it retrieves all logs for the current batch  \n8. Generates a clean HTML report summarising the compression results  \n9. Sends the report via **Gmail**, including total space saved  \n\nHere is an example from my personal folder:\n\n[![Folder Image](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-25.png)](https://youtu.be/qXQVcaJgwrA)\n\nHere is the report generated for these images:\n\n[![Email Screenshot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-24.png)](https://youtu.be/qXQVcaJgwrA)\n\n*P.S.: You can customise the report to match your company branding or visual identity.*\n\n### 🎥 Tutorial\n\nA complete tutorial (with explanations of every node) is available on YouTube:\n\n[![Tutorial + Demo](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/temp-12.png)](https://youtu.be/qXQVcaJgwrA)\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBefore running the workflow, follow the sticky notes and configure the following:\n\n- Get your Tinify API key for the free tier here: [Get your key](https://tinypng.com/developers/reference)  \n- Replace Google Drive folder IDs in: **Input**, **Compressed**, and **Original Images**  \n- Replace the **Data Table** reference with your own (fields required: `fileName`, `originalSize`, `compressedSize`, `imageId`, `outputUrl`, `processingId`)  \n- Add your **Tinify API key** in the HTTP Basic Auth credentials  \n- Set up your **Gmail** credentials and recipient email  \n- (Optional) Customise the **HTML report** in the `Generate Report` Code node  \n- (Optional) Adjust the **daily schedule** to your preferred time  \n\n*Submitted: 18 November 2025*  \n*Template designed with n8n version 1.116.2*\n",
