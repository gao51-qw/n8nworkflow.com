  "description": "# Generate AEO strategy from brand input using AI competitor analysis\n\nThis workflow automatically creates a comprehensive Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) strategy by identifying your top competitors, analyzing their positioning, and generating custom recommendations to help your brand rank in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google SGE.\n\n## Who it's for\n\nThis template is perfect for:\n- **Digital marketing agencies** offering AEO services to clients\n- **In-house marketers** optimizing content for AI search engines\n- **Brand strategists** analyzing competitive positioning\n- **Content teams** creating AI-optimized content strategies\n- **SEO professionals** expanding into Answer Engine Optimization\n\n## What it does\n\nThe workflow automates the entire AEO research and strategy process in 6 steps:\n\n1. **Collects brand information** via a user-friendly web form (brand name, website, niche, product type, email)\n2. **Identifies top 3 competitors** using Google Gemini AI based on product overlap, market position, digital presence, and geographic factors\n3. **Scrapes target brand website** with Firecrawl to extract value propositions, features, and content themes\n4. **Scrapes competitor websites** in parallel to gather competitive intelligence\n5. **Generates comprehensive AEO strategy** using OpenAI GPT-4 with 15+ actionable recommendations\n6. **Delivers formatted report via email** with executive summary, competitive analysis, and implementation roadmap\n\nThe entire process runs automatically and takes approximately 5-7 minutes to complete.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou'll need API credentials for:\n- **Google Gemini API** (for competitor analysis) - [Get API key](https://ai.google.dev/)\n- **OpenAI API** (for strategy generation) - [Get API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)\n- **Firecrawl API** (for web scraping) - [Get API key](https://firecrawl.dev/)\n- **Gmail account** (for email delivery) - Use OAuth2 authentication\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n1. **Import the workflow** into your n8n instance\n2. **Configure credentials**:\n   - Add your Google Gemini API key to the \"Google Gemini Chat Model\" node\n   - Add your OpenAI API key to the \"OpenAI Chat Model\" node\n   - Add your Firecrawl API key as HTTP Header Auth credentials\n   - Connect your Gmail account using OAuth2\n3. **Activate the workflow** and copy the form webhook URL\n4. **Test the workflow** by submitting a real brand through the form\n5. **Check your email** for the generated AEO strategy report\n\n### Credentials Setup Tips\n\n- For Firecrawl: Create HTTP Header Auth credentials with header name `Authorization` and value `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`\n- For Gmail: Use OAuth2 to avoid authentication issues with 2FA\n- Test each API credential individually before running the full workflow\n\n## How it works\n\n### Competitor Identification\nThe Google Gemini AI agent analyzes your brand based on 4 weighted criteria: product/service overlap (40%), market position (30%), digital presence (20%), and geographic overlap (10%). It returns structured JSON data with competitor names, URLs, overlap percentages, and detailed reasoning.\n\n### Web Scraping\nFirecrawl extracts structured data from websites using custom schemas. For each site, it captures: company name, products/services, value proposition, target audience, key features, pricing info, and content themes. This runs asynchronously with 60-second waits to allow for complete extraction.\n\n### Strategy Generation  \nOpenAI GPT-4 analyzes the combined brand and competitor data to generate a comprehensive report including: executive summary, competitive analysis, 15+ specific AEO tactics across 4 categories (content optimization, structural improvements, authority building, answer engine targeting), content priority matrix with 10 ranked topics, and a detailed implementation roadmap.\n\n### Email Delivery\nThe strategy is formatted as a professional HTML email with clear sections, visual hierarchy, and actionable next steps. Recipients get an immediately implementable roadmap for improving their AEO performance.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Change AI Models\n- **Replace Google Gemini** with Claude, GPT-4, or other LLM in the competitor analysis node\n- **Replace OpenAI** with Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini in the strategy generation node\n- Both use LangChain agent nodes, making model swapping straightforward\n\n### Modify Competitor Analysis\n- **Find more competitors**: Edit the AI prompt to request 5 or 10 competitors instead of 3\n- **Add filtering criteria**: Include factors like company size, funding stage, or geographic focus\n- **Change ranking weights**: Adjust the 40/30/20/10 weighting in the prompt\n\n### Enhance Data Collection\n- **Add social media scraping**: Include LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or Facebook page analysis\n- **Pull review data**: Integrate G2, Capterra, or Trustpilot APIs for customer sentiment\n- **Include traffic data**: Add SimilarWeb or Semrush API calls for competitive metrics\n\n### Change Output Format\n- **Export to Google Docs**: Replace Gmail with Google Docs node to create shareable documents\n- **Send to Slack/Discord**: Post strategy summaries to team channels for collaboration\n- **Save to database**: Store results in Airtable, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for tracking\n- **Create presentations**: Generate PowerPoint slides using automation tools\n\n### Add More Features\n- **Schedule periodic analysis**: Run monthly competitive audits for specific brands\n- **A/B test strategies**: Generate multiple strategies and compare results over time\n- **Multi-language support**: Add translation nodes for international brands\n- **Custom branding**: Modify email templates with your agency's logo and colors\n\n### Adjust Scraping Behavior\n- **Change Firecrawl schema**: Customize extracted data fields based on industry needs\n- **Add timeout handling**: Implement retry logic for failed scraping attempts\n- **Scrape more pages**: Extend beyond homepage to include blog, pricing, and about pages\n- **Use different scrapers**: Replace Firecrawl with Apify, Browserless, or custom solutions\n\n## Tips for best results\n\n- **Provide clear brand information**: The more specific the product type and niche, the better the competitor identification\n- **Ensure websites are accessible**: Some sites block scrapers; consider adding user agents or rotating IPs\n- **Monitor API costs**: Firecrawl and OpenAI charges can add up; set usage limits\n- **Review generated strategies**: AI recommendations should be reviewed and customized for your specific context\n- **Iterate on prompts**: Fine-tune the AI prompts based on output quality over multiple runs\n\n## Common use cases\n\n- **Client onboarding** for marketing agencies - Generate initial AEO assessments\n- **Content strategy planning** - Identify topics and angles competitors are missing\n- **Quarterly audits** - Track competitive positioning changes over time  \n- **Product launches** - Understand competitive landscape before entering market\n- **Sales enablement** - Equip sales teams with competitive intelligence\n\n---\n\n**Note**: This workflow uses community and AI nodes that require external API access. Make sure your n8n instance can make outbound HTTP requests and has the necessary LangChain nodes installed.\n",
