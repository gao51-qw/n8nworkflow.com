  "description": "# Automated HTML Welcome Email for New Xero Contacts\n\nCrafted with ❤️ by the automation experts at **[Elegant BizTech](https://www.elegantbiztech.com/)**.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis workflow automatically sends a beautiful, personalized HTML welcome email to a new contact the moment they are created in your Xero account.\n\n## Description\n\nFirst impressions matter. When you add a new client or customer to Xero, the opportunity to welcome them warmly and professionally is often missed. Manually sending welcome emails is time-consuming and inconsistent.\n\nThis workflow solves that problem by instantly triggering a customizable email that not only welcomes your new contact but also confirms the key details you have on file, building trust and starting the relationship on a high note.\n\n## What it does\n\n*   **Triggers** when a new contact is created in Xero.\n*   **Filters** to ensure it only runs for *new* contacts, not updates.\n*   **Fetches** the full contact details (Name, Address, Phone) from Xero for personalization.\n*   **Builds** a beautifully formatted HTML email using the contact's data.\n*   **Sends** the final, personalized email to the new contact via your preferred SMTP service.\n\n## **Setup Guide**\n\nFollow these steps carefully to configure this workflow for your own use.\n\n### **IMPORTANT: Handling Xero Webhook Signatures**\n\n&gt; Xero webhooks require a signature verification that the standard n8n Webhook node cannot perform directly. To solve this, this workflow is designed to be used with a simple proxy application.\n\n&gt; **You must first set up a small Express.js (or similar) application on your own server/VPS.**\n\n&gt; 1.  This app receives the webhook from Xero and verifies the signature.\n\n&gt; 2.  Once verified, it forwards the clean JSON payload to the n8n Webhook URL.\n\n&gt; The first node in this workflow, `Start: New Contact in Xero`, contains the URL where your proxy app should send the data.\n\n### **Step 1: Credentials**\n\nThis workflow requires two sets of credentials.\n\n*   **(Node: `Fetch Full Contact Details from Xero`) Xero Account:**\n    1.  Select the `Fetch Full Contact Details from Xero` node.\n    2.  In the `Credential for Xero API` field, select your existing credential or click `Create New` to connect your Xero account to n8n.\n\n*   **(Node: `Send Personalized Welcome Email`) SMTP Account:**\n    1.  Select the `Send Personalized Welcome Email` node.\n    2.  In the `Credential for SMTP` field, select your existing credential or click `Create New` to connect your email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid) to n8n.\n\n### **Step 2: Customize Your Email Template**\n\nThis is where you make the email your own!\n\n1.  Select the **`Build Personalized HTML Email`** (Code) node.\n2.  Inside the code editor, you'll need to update the following placeholders:\n    *   **Line 35:** Change `https://yourdomain.com/images/logo.png` to the direct URL of your company's logo.\n    *   **Line 47:** Change `https://yourdomain.com/` to the link you want the main call-to-action button to go to (e.g., your website or a client portal).\n    *   **Line 53:** Change `info@yourdomain.com` to your company's support email address.\n    *   **Line 54:** Change `[Your Company Name]` to your actual company name.\n\n### **Step 3: Activate Your Workflow**\n\n1.  Click the **`Active`** toggle in the top-right corner of the n8n canvas.\n2.  Save the workflow.\n\nNow, go to your Xero account, create a new contact, and watch the magic happen! A beautiful, personalized email will be sent automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Need Help or More Advanced Workflows?\n\nAt **Elegant BizTech**, we specialize in creating powerful, custom automations that streamline your business processes.\n\n*   **Visit our website:** [https://www.elegantbiztech.com/](https://www.elegantbiztech.com/)\n*   **Contact us for a consultation:** [sales@elegantbiztech.com](mailto:sales@elegantbiztech.com)",
