  "description": "Icebreaker Generator powered with ChatGPT \n\nThis n8n template crawls a company website, distills the content with AI, and produces a short, personalized icebreaker you can drop straight into your cold emails or CRM. Perfect for SDRs, founders, and agencies who want “real research” at scale.\n\nGood to know\n\nWorks from a Google Sheet of leads (domain + LinkedIn, etc.).\n\nHandles common scrape failures gracefully and marks the lead’s Status as Error.\n\nUses ChatGPT to summarize pages and craft one concise, non-generic opener.\n\nOutput is written back to the same Google Sheet (IceBreaker, Status).\n\nYou’ll need Google credentials (for Sheets) and OpenAI credentials (for GPT).\n\nHow it works\n\nStep 1 — Discover internal pages\n\nReads a lead’s website from Google Sheets.\n\nScrapes the home page and extracts all links.\n\nA Code node cleans the list (removes emails/anchors/social/external domains, normalizes paths, de-duplicates) and returns unique internal URLs.\n\nIf the home page is unreachable or no links are found, the lead is marked Error and the workflow moves on.\n\nStep 2 — Convert pages to text\n\nVisits each collected URL and converts the response into HTML/Markdown text for analysis.\n\nYou can cap depth/amount with the Limit node.\n\nStep 3 — Summarize & generate the icebreaker\n\nA GPT node produces a two-paragraph abstract for each page (JSON output).\n\nAn Aggregate node merges all abstracts for the company.\n\nAnother GPT node turns the merged summary into a personalized, multi-line icebreaker (spartan tone, non-obvious details).\n\nThe result is written back to Google Sheets (IceBreaker = ..., Status = Done).\n\nThe workflow loops to the next lead.\n\nHow to use\n\nPrepare your sheet\n\nInclude at least: organization_website_url, linkedin_url, and any other lead fields you track.\n\nKeep an empty IceBreaker and Status column for the workflow to fill.\n\nConnect credentials\n\nGoogle Sheets: use the Google account that owns the sheet and link it in the nodes.\n\nOpenAI: add your API key to the GPT nodes (“Summarize Website Page”, “Generate Multiline Icebreaker”).\n\nRun the workflow\n\nStart with the Manual Trigger (or replace with a schedule/webhook).\n\nAdjust Limit if you want fewer/more pages per company.\n\nWatch Status (Done/Error) and IceBreaker populate in your sheet.\n\nRequirements\n\nn8n instance\n\nGoogle Sheets account & access to the leads sheet\n\nOpenAI API key (for summarization + icebreaker generation)\n\nCustomizing this workflow\n\nTone & format: tweak the prompts (both GPT nodes) to match your brand voice and structure.\n\nDepth: change the Limit node to scan more/less pages; add simple rules to prioritize certain paths (e.g., /about, /blog/*).\n\nFields: write additional outputs (e.g., Company Summary, Key Products, Recent News) back to new sheet columns.\n\nLead selection: filter rows by Status = \"\" (or custom flags) to only process untouched leads.\n\nError handling: expand the Error branch to retry with www./HTTP→HTTPS or to log diagnostics in a separate tab.\n\nTips\n\nKeep icebreakers short, specific, and free of clichés—small, non-obvious details from the site convert best.\n\nStart with a small batch to validate quality, then scale up.\n\nConsider adding a rate limit if target sites throttle requests.\n\nIn short: Sheet → crawl internal pages → AI abstracts → single tailored icebreaker → write back to the sheet, then repeat for the next lead.\n\nThis automation can work great with our automation for automated cold emailing.",
