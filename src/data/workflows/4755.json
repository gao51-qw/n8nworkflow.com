It will look something like that:\n\n![InfraNodus graph knowledge base](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/article_attachments/20266752795292)\n\n***Note:** you can replace the PDF to Text convertor node with a better quality **PDF convertor** from [ConvertAPI](https://convertapi.com?ref=4l54n) which respects the original file layout and doesn't split text into small chunks*\n\n\n**Step 2: Chat with your documents**\n\n- Deactive the trigger in the Step 1\n- Activate the chat trigger in the Step 2\n- Add your InfraNodus API credentials to Knowledge Base GraphRAG InfraNodus node\n- Optional: change the graph `name` in the Knowledge Base node to match the name you provided in the step 1 above\n- Run the chat and ask the question\n- Watch the magic \n\n## How to use\n\nYou need an [InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) to use this workflow. \n\n- Create an InfraNodus account\n- Get the API key at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access) and create a Bearer authorization key for the InfraNodus HTTP nodes.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- An [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) account and API key\n- An OpenAI (or any other LLM) API key\n- A Google Drive OAuth access (follow the n8n instructions)\n- Optional: [ConvertAPI](https://convertapi.com?ref=4l54n) API key for better quality PDF conversion\n\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n\nYou can customize this workflow by adding several experts to your AI agent. \n\nCheck out the **complete guide** at [https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20174217658396-Using-InfraNodus-Knowledge-Graphs-as-Experts-for-AI-Chatbot-Agents-in-n8n](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20174217658396-Using-InfraNodus-Knowledge-Graphs-as-Experts-for-AI-Chatbot-Agents-in-n8n)\n\nAlso check out the **video tutorial** with a demo:\n\n[![Video tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kS0QTUvcH6E/sddefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS0QTUvcH6E)\n\nFor **support and feedback**, please, contact us at [https://support.noduslabs.com](https://support.noduslabs.com)\n\nTo learn more about **InfraNodus**: [https://infranodus.com](https://infranodus.com)\n\n\n\n",
