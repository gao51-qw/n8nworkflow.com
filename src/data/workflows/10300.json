It also skips non-English titles to avoid unnecessary translation.\n## How it works\n・RSS watches a channel for new items.\n・YouTube API fetches the full snippet (title/description).\n・Text is combined into a single payload and sent to DeepL.\n・The translated result + original metadata is merged and posted to Slack.\n\n## Requirements\n・YouTube OAuth (for reliable snippet retrieval)\n・DeepL API key (Free or Pro)\n・Slack OAuth\n\n## How to set up\n・Duplicate this template.\n・Open the Config (Set) node and fill in YT_CHANNEL_ID, TARGET_LANG, SLACK_CHANNEL.\n・Connect credentials for YouTube, DeepL, and Slack (don’t hardcode API keys in HTTP nodes).\n・Click Execute workflow and verify one sample post.\n\n## How to customize\n・Change TARGET_LANG to any language supported by DeepL.\n・Add filters (exclude Shorts, skip videos under N characters).\n・Switch to Slack Blocks for richer formatting or thread replies.\n・Add a fallback translator or retry logic on HTTP errors.\n## Notes & limits\nDeepL Free/Pro have different endpoints/quotas and monthly character limits. YouTube and Slack also enforce rate limits. Keep credentials in n8n’s credential store; do not commit keys into templates. Rotate keys if you accidentally exposed them.",
