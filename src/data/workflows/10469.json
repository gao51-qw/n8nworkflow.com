  "description": "Transform your Google Form into an intelligent customer support system that automatically analyzes, prioritizes, and responds to every inquiry with AI-powered personalization.\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\n- **Customer support teams** handling high volumes of form submissions\n- **Small businesses** looking to provide instant, professional responses 24/7\n- **E-commerce stores** managing product inquiries, complaints, and refunds\n- **Service providers** triaging appointment requests and support tickets\n- **Event organizers** responding to registration questions\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen someone submits your Google Form, this workflow:\n\n- **Triggers instantly** from new Google Sheets row\n- **Analyzes with AI** to determine urgency (low/medium/high), category (technical/sales/support/billing), and sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)\n- **Routes intelligently** based on priority level to appropriate response template\n- **Generates personalized reply** using OpenAI, tailored to urgency and sentiment\n- **Sends auto-reply** via Gmail with professional formatting\n- **Alerts your team** on Slack for high-priority cases requiring human follow-up\n- **Logs everything** to tracking sheet for analytics and audit trail\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Time to set up:** approximately 15-20 minutes\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Google Form connected to Google Sheets\n- OpenAI API key (get one at platform.openai.com)\n- Gmail account for sending emails\n- Slack workspace (optional, for team alerts)\n\n### Configuration steps\n\n1. **Connect Google Sheets Trigger** to your form response sheet\n2. **Update column names** in \"Map Form Column Names\" node (default: Name, Email Address, Inquiry)\n3. **Add OpenAI credentials** - uses GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency (approximately $0.001 per inquiry)\n4. **Connect Gmail** via OAuth2 for sending auto-replies\n5. **Create tracking sheet** with columns: timestamp, name, email, urgency, category, sentiment, summary, keywords, subject, inquiry\n6. **(Optional) Connect Slack** for high-priority notifications\n7. **Test with sample data** before activating\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Google Form (free)\n- Google Sheets (free)\n- OpenAI API account (approximately $0.001-0.002 per inquiry with GPT-4o-mini)\n- Gmail account (free)\n- Slack workspace (optional, free tier available)\n- n8n Cloud or self-hosted instance\n\n## How to customize\n\n**Adjust triage criteria:**\n\nEdit the \"Analyze with AI Triage\" prompt to define what qualifies as high/medium/low urgency for your business. Add custom categories beyond the default five (technical/sales/support/billing/general).\n\n**Modify response templates:**\n\nCustomize the three response generation nodes to match your brand voice. Add company-specific information, policies, or FAQ links. Adjust tone from formal to casual based on your audience.\n\n**Add advanced features:**\n\n- Insert CRM integration to check customer history before responding\n- Add condition nodes to route specific categories to different team members\n- Include file attachments (brochures, manuals) based on inquiry type\n- Implement follow-up sequences with Wait nodes\n- Connect multiple notification channels (Discord, email, SMS)\n\n**Multi-language support:**\n\nThe AI automatically detects and responds in the inquiry's language. Customize prompts with language-specific instructions if needed.\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Product support:** Auto-respond to \"how to use\" questions with relevant documentation\n- **Complaint management:** Immediately acknowledge issues and alert team for urgent follow-up\n- **Lead qualification:** Instantly engage sales inquiries while routing to appropriate sales rep\n- **Appointment requests:** Confirm booking inquiries and provide next steps\n- **Feedback collection:** Thank customers and categorize feedback for analysis",
