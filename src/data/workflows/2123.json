  "description": "# What it does\nThe workflow is a simple yet efficient way to automate the process of indexing your website on Google using the Google Indexing API.\n\n# How it works\n\nIt works by extracting information from your sitemap, converting it into a JSON file, and looping through each URL to submit it for indexing. \n\n\nHere's a brief rundown of the workflow:\n\n1. The workflow can be triggered manually via the \"Execute Workflow\" button or scheduled to run at a specific time using the \"Schedule Trigger\" node.\n\n2. The sitemap of your website is fetched using the \"sitemap_set\" node with a HTTP Request to the sitemap URL. \n\n3. This XML sitemap is then converted into a JSON file using the \"sitemap_convert\" node.\n\n4. The \"sitemap_parse\" node splits the JSON file into individual URLs.\n\n5. The \"url_set\" node then prepares each URL to be sent to the Google Indexing API.\n\n6. A loop is created using the \"loop\" node to process each URL individually and make a POST request to Google Indexing API indicating that the URL has been updated.\n\n7. If the POST request is successful and the URL has been updated, the workflow waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next URL.\n\n8. In case the daily limit for the Google Indexing API is reached (200/day by default), an error message is triggered using the \"Stop and Error\" node.\n# Before you use the workflow\n## Activate the indexing API\n* Create an account with Google Cloud Platform &gt; Console and then create a new project\n* Search for the Indexing API in the Library\n* Activate the API\n\n## Create a Service Account and get credentials\n* Open the Service accounts page. If prompted, select a project.\n* Click add Create Service Account, enter a name and description for the service account. You can use the default service account ID, or choose a different, unique one. \n* When done click Create.\n* On the Grant users access to this service account screen, scroll down to the Create key section. Click add Create key.\n* In the side panel that appears, select the JSON format\n* Click Create. Your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine.\n* Open the file and copy the private key.\n* Add the credentials in the url_index node\n\n![image.png](fileId:743)\n\n\n## Add the user as owner of the site\nBeware, for each site you need to add the user as a owner like this:\n\n![image.png](fileId:742)\n\n## Set your sitemap\n\n* Open the sitemap_set node and add the url to your sitemap.\n\n-------\n*Now you should be able to ensure that Google is always up-to-date with the latest content on your website, improving your website's visibility and SEO rankings, have fun!*",
