The system begins with website content extraction.\n\n**Intelligence Gathering:** A dedicated scraper sub-workflow extracts all website content and converts it to structured markdown. \n\n**Strategic Analysis:** LLMs process the scraped content to understand the business model, target market, and competitive positioning.
