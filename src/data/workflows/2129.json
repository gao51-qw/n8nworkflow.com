Normally this involves a lot of manual research before every call. This workflow automates this tedious work for you.\n## What this workflow does\nThe workflow runs every time a new call is booked via your Calendly. It then filters out personal emails, before enriching the email. If the email is attached to a company it enriches the company and upserts it in your Hubspot CRM.\n## Setup\n1. Add `Clearbit`, `Hubspot`, and `Calendly` credentials.\n2. Click on `Test workflow`.\n3. Book a meeting on Calendly so the event starts the workflow.\nBe aware that you can adapt this workflow to work with your enrichment tool, CRM, and booking tool of choice.",
