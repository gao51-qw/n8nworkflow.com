It programmatically allows for adding and deleting of repos to your watchlist to make management convenient.\n\n## Description\n- Can monitor multiple repos simultaneously.\n- Programmatically register or unregister repos from a list. No need for manual work.\n- Webhook notification means no constant polling necessary.\n\n## Setup\n### 1. Creating Credentials on Github\nGenerate a personal access token on github by following these esteps;\n- Right hand side of page -> Settings -> scroll to bottom -> Developer Settings > Personal Access Token > Tokens (classic) > Generate New Token\n- Give scopes:\n   *admin:repo_hook*\n   *repo* (if you want to use it for your own private repo)\n\nif you need more help, see here:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens\n\n### 2. Setting Credentials in n8n\nIn `Register Github Webhook`\n*Authenticaion > Generic Credential Type*\n*Generic Auth Type > Header Auth*\n*Header Auth > Create New Credential* with Name set to *'Authorization'* and Value set to *'Bearer <YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE>'*.\n(You can reuse this for `Delete Github Webhook` and `Get Existing Webhooks`).\nNow in `Register Github Webhook`, scroll down to Send Body > JSON and inside the JSON, change the value of *\"url\"* to the webhook address given as Production URL in the node `Webhook Trigger`.\n\n### 3.

Register Webhooks\n- In `Repos to Monitor`, add any repo you want to monitor changes for. \n- Disable `Webhook Trigger`, Click `Test Workflow` and if your Github credentials were set correctly, it will automatically register the webhooks. - You can test this by running the single node `Get Existing Webhook` and confirming it outputs the repo addresses.\n## 2. Handle Github Events\n- Now that you have registered the webhooks, re-enable `Webhook Trigger` and activate the workflow.\n- Make a commit to any of the registered repos.\n- Confirm that the notification went through.\n*That's it!*",
