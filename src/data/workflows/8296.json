  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates how to automatically generate and publish blog posts using trending keywords, AI-generated content, and watermarked stock images.\nUse cases include maintaining an active blog with fresh SEO content, scaling content marketing without manual writing, and automating the full publishing pipeline from keyword research to WordPress posting.\n\n### Good to know\n\nAt time of writing, each AI content generation step will incur costs depending on your OpenAI pricing plan.\nImage search is powered by Pexels, which provides free-to-use stock images.

A structured output parser ensures the text is clean and well-formatted.\nThe system then searches Pexels for a matching image, uploads it, adds metadata for SEO, and applies a watermark.\nFinally, the complete article (text and image) is published directly to WordPress.\n\n### How to use\n\nThe schedule trigger is provided as an example, but you can replace it with other triggers such as webhooks or manual inputs.\nYou can also customize the AI prompt to match your niche, tone, or industry focus.\nFor higher volumes, consider adjusting the keyword filtering and batching logic.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* OpenAI account for content generation\n* Pexels API key for stock image search\n* Google account with Sheets for keyword tracking\n* WordPress site with API access for publishing\n\n### Customising this workflow\n\nThis automation can be adapted for different use cases. Try adjusting the prompts for technical blogs, fashion, finance, or product reviews.\nYou can also replace the image source with other providers or integrate your own media library.\nThe watermark feature ensures branding, but it can be modified or removed depending on your needs.",
