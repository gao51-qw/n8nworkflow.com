  "description": "# 📧 AI-Powered Gmail Auto-Labeling with Smart Classification\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically organizes your Gmail inbox by intelligently categorizing incoming emails and applying custom labels using AI-powered sentiment analysis. Say goodbye to manual email sorting and hello to an organized inbox!\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Business Email Management**: Automatically sort partnership inquiries, meeting requests, and promotional emails\n- **Sales Team Automation**: Identify and label cold outreach and high-priority leads\n- **Executive Assistants**: Filter important meetings and urgent matters for busy professionals\n- **Marketing Teams**: Separate promotional content from genuine business communications\n\n## Good to Know\n- The workflow runs every minute to check for new emails\n- Each email is processed only once - already labeled emails are automatically skipped\n- Uses OpenAI's GPT model for accurate email classification (API costs apply)\n- Processes emails in batches to handle multiple incoming messages efficiently\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Gmail Trigger** continuously monitors your inbox for new emails every minute\n2. **Switch Node** checks if emails already have labels (Other, Promotion, or Meeting) to avoid duplicate processing\n3. **Loop Node** processes emails in batches for efficient handling\n4. **AI Classification** analyzes the email's sender, subject, and content using OpenAI's GPT model to categorize into:\n   - **Partnerships** - Collaboration opportunities and B2B proposals\n   - **Promotional** - Marketing emails and newsletters\n   - **Cold Outreach** - Unsolicited sales emails and prospecting\n   - **Meeting** - Calendar invites and scheduling requests\n   - **High Priority** - Urgent matters requiring immediate attention\n   - **Other** - Everything else that doesn't fit the above categories\n5. **Label Application** automatically applies the appropriate Gmail label based on AI classification\n6. **Loop Completion** returns to process the next email in the batch\n\n## How to Use\n- Set up your Gmail credentials to connect the workflow to your account\n- Create custom labels in Gmail (or use the pre-configured label IDs in the workflow)\n- Add your OpenAI API credentials for AI classification\n- Activate the workflow and let it run automatically in the background\n- Optionally adjust the polling frequency from \"every minute\" to your preference\n\n## Requirements\n- **Gmail OAuth2** credentials for email access and label management\n- **OpenAI API** key for GPT-powered email classification\n- Pre-created Gmail labels for each category (or modify label IDs in the workflow)\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n- **Add More Categories**: Extend the sentiment analysis node with additional email categories relevant to your business\n- **Adjust Classification Logic**: Modify the AI prompt to better match your specific email patterns\n- **Change Polling Frequency**: Update the Gmail trigger to check more or less frequently based on your email volume\n- **Add Actions**: Extend each label branch to trigger additional actions like Slack notifications, database updates, or auto-replies\n- **Filter by Sender**: Add conditions to the Switch node to handle VIP senders differently",
