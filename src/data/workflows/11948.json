  "description": "# Summary\n\nThis workflow enables the submission of business-critical URLs via the Google Indexing API and IndexNow.\n\nWhy is this important for SEO?\n\n- If your objective is visibility within AI-powered search and answer engines (such as Copilot, Perplexity, or OpenAI tools), the IndexNow integration is particularly relevant. IndexNow accelerates URL discovery for Bing and Yandex, which are key retrieval sources for several LLM-based platforms.\n- In parallel, Google remains the dominant search engine, representing ~80% of global search traffic. Gemini is deeply integrated into Google’s ecosystem and, when grounding is enabled, can leverage Google Search as an external retrieval source. Ensuring fast and reliable indexation of critical URLs therefore remains a strategic foundation for both traditional SEO and AI-assisted search experiences.\n\n# Description\n\nThis workflow uses OnCrawl API endpoint to automatically discover your `sitemaps.xml` and submit their latest updates to both Google Indexing API and IndexNOW.\n\nIt includes two variations:\n\n- Index orphan pages detected in `sitemap.xml` and submit them to Google and IndexNow.\n- Index newly released pages by identifying indexable canonical URLs added between a pre-release crawl and a post-release crawl.\n\n# How it works\n\nThis workflow works for Oncrawl users with API access enabled in their plan.\n\nif you are not an Oncrawl users, please refer to: [https://n8n.io/workflows/8778-workflow-for-submitting-changed-sitemap-urls-using-google-indexing-api-and-bing-indexnow/](https://n8n.io/workflows/8778-workflow-for-submitting-changed-sitemap-urls-using-google-indexing-api-and-bing-indexnow/)\n\nTo get an API Key, just go in your User Account profile &gt; tokens &gt; + Add API access token:\n\n- Description: any name\n- Scope: select all checkboxes\n- Click in Create token.
