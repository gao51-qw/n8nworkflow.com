Fetches the complete list of workflows from your n8n instance via API.\n\n2. Downloads each workflow in JSON format.\n3. Converts the data into a file with a unique name (workflow name + ID).\n4. Uploads all files to a chosen Google Drive folder.\n5. Can be run manually or via an automatic schedule (daily, weekly, etc.).\n\n## Requirements\n- An active n8n instance with API access enabled\n- API credentials for n8n (API key or basic auth)\n- A Google account with access to Google Drive\n- Google Drive credentials connected in n8n\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Connect your n8n API (authenticate your instance).  \n2. Connect your Google Drive account.  \n3. Select or create the Drive folder where backups will be stored.  \n4. Customize the Schedule Trigger to define backup frequency.  \n5. Run once to confirm files are stored correctly.\n\n## Customization Options\nFrequency → Set daily, weekly, or monthly backups.\n\nFile Naming → Adjust filename expression (e.g., {{workflowName}}-{{workflowId}}-{{date}}.json).\n\nFolder Location → Store backups in separate Google Drive folders per project or client.\n\n## Target Audience\nThis template is ideal for:\n\nFreelancers managing multiple client automations.\n\nAgencies delivering automation services.\n\nTeams that rely on n8n for mission-critical workflows.\n\nIt reduces risk, saves time, and ensures you never lose your work.\n\n\n⏱ Estimated setup time: 5–10 minutes.\n",
