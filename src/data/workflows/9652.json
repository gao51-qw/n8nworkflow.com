  "description": "# 📸 Instagram Post Automation Workflow\n\n## ℹ️ What is this workflow\nThis workflow automatically produces daily Instagram posts based on a user-provided prompt and sends them to your email inbox.  \nSocial media creators can use it to generate content periodically and save time.  \n\nThe email includes:  \n- Picture  \n- Title  \n- Caption  \n- Relevant hashtags  \n\nYou can simply copy and paste the content from the email into Instagram, or go further by connecting it to the Facebook API for **full automation**.\n\n## 💼 Business Cases\n- Generating social media posts primarily for Instagram.  \n- Integrating with other workflows (trend research, market studies, news feeds) to produce images, statistics, text, or data comparisons for social media.\n\n## 💰 Business Value\nIf you produce daily posts and each Instagram post takes around 1 hour to find a quote, create an image, caption, and hashtags, this workflow does it in less than 1 minute.\n\nThis saves you:\n* Weekly: 7 hours (1 hour × 7 days)\n* Monthly: 30 hours (1 hour × 30 days)\n* Yearly: 360 hours (12 months × 30 hours)\nAt a cost of $20/hour, this workflow saves:\n$7,200 annually (360 hours × $20).\n\n**In total, you're saving 360 hours + $7,200 per year, allowing you to focus on other valuable activities.**\n\n## ⚙️ How Does It Work\n1. The workflow runs periodically according to your schedule settings.  \n2. Generates a new quote, avoiding duplicates of previously created ones.  \n3. Creates an image.  \n4. Sends all content by email.\n\n## 🔗 Integrated Services\n- Local file storage on the hosted platform  \n- OpenAI GPT model (customizable to any AI model you prefer)  \n- Gemini model for image generation (replaceable with your preferred tool)  \n- Email sending via SMTP\n\n## 🛠 How to Set Up\n1. Install the workflow template.  \n2. Configure AI models and set up SMTP credentials.  \n3. Create a file on your local installation (`/home/node/instagram_posts.txt`).  \n4. Set up the scheduler.  \n5. Test and enjoy.",
