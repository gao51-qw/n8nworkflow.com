  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template is a hands-on tutorial for one of the most advanced and powerful patterns in n8n: **asynchronous parallel processing**, also known as the **Fan-Out/Fan-In** model.\n\n**When should you use this?**\nUse this pattern when **speed is your top priority** and you have multiple independent, long-running tasks. Instead of running them one after another (which is slow), this workflow runs them all at the same time and waits for them all to finish.\n\nWe use a **Construction Project** analogy to explain the architecture:\n*   **The Main Workflow (Top):** This is the **Project Manager**. It defines the project, assigns all the tasks to specialist teams, and then pauses, waiting for a final report.\n*   **The Sub-Workflow (Bottom):** This represents the **Specialist Teams**. It's a single, reusable workflow that can perform any task it's assigned.\n*   **Static Data (The Brains):** A hidden **Project Dashboard** is used to track the status of every task in real-time.\n\nThe process follows three key phases:\n1.  **Fan-Out:** The Project Manager starts multiple sub-workflows at once *without* waiting for them to finish.\n2.  **Asynchronous Execution:** Each Specialist Team works on its task independently and in parallel. When a team finishes, it updates its status on the Project Dashboard.\n3.  **Fan-In:** The Project Manager, which has been paused by a `Wait` node, is only resumed when the Project Dashboard confirms that *all* tasks are complete. It then receives the aggregated results from all the parallel tasks.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: &lt; 1 minute**\n\nThis workflow is a self-contained tutorial. The only setup required is to configure the AI model.\n\n1.  **Configure Credentials:**\n    *   Go to the **`The AI Specialist`** node in the sub-workflow (bottom flow).\n    *   Select your desired AI credential (Gemini in that case).\n2.  **Execute the Workflow:**\n    *   Click the **\"Execute Workflow\"** button on the `Start Project` node.\n3.  **Explore and Learn:**\n    *   Follow the execution path to see how the main workflow fans out, and how the sub-workflow is called multiple times.\n    *   Click on each node and read the detailed sticky notes to understand its specific role in this advanced pattern.",
