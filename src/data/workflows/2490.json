Due to a n8n limitation, this endpoint will have an additional code in the path (e.g. https://my.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/580ccc56-f308-4b64-961d-38323501a170/customers/:id).

Import the workflow into your n8n workspace\n2. Customize the endpoint paths by tweaking the 'Path' parameters in the 'Webhook' and 'Webhook (with ID)' nodes (currently *customers*)\n3. Set up your Airtable credentials by following [this guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) and customize the Airtable nodes by selecting your base, table, and the correct fields to update. *...or...* replace the Airtable nodes and connect the endpoint to any other service (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, Notion, Coda)\n\n\n# How to use the workflow\n\n1. Activate the workflow\n2. Connect your app to the endpoints (production URLs) to perform the various operations allowed by the workflow\n\nNote that the Webhook nodes have two URLs, one for testing and one for production. The testing URL is activated when you click on 'Test workflow' button and can't be used for production. The production URL is available after you activate the workflow.
