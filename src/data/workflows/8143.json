  "title": "Morning briefing podcast: generate daily summaries with Gemini AI, weather, and calendar",
  "description": "## What it does\n\nInstead of manually checking separate apps for your calendar, weather, and news each morning, this workflow consolidates the most important information into a single, convenient audio briefing. The \"Good Morning Podcast\" is designed to be a 3-minute summary of your day ahead, delivered directly to you. It's multi-lingual and customizable, allowing you to start your day informed and efficiently.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe workflow executes in three parallel branches before merging the data to generate the final audio file.\n\n1.  **Weather Summary:** It starts by taking a user-provided **city** and fetching the current 15-hour forecast from the **OpenWeatherMap**. It formats this information into a concise weather report.\n2.  **Calendar Summary:** It securely connects to your **Google Calendar** to retrieve all of today's scheduled meetings and events. It then formats the schedule into a clear, readable summary.\n3.  **News Summary:** It connects to the **NewsAPI** to perform two tasks: it fetches the top general headlines and also searches for articles based on user-defined **keywords** (e.g., \"AI\", \"automation\", \"space exploration\"). The collected headlines are then summarized using a **Google Gemini** node to create a brief news digest.\n4.  Audio Generation and Delivery: All three text summaries (weather, calendar, and news) are merged into a single script. The workflow uses **Google's Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to generate the raw multi-speaker audio. A dedicated **FFmpeg** node then processes and converts this audio into the final MP3 format. The completed podcast is then sent directly to you via a **Telegram Bot**.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nTo get this workflow running, you will need to configure credentials for each of the external services and set your initial parameters.\n\n⚠️ Important Prerequisite\n**Install FFmpeg**: The workflow requires the `FFmpeg` software package to be installed on the machine running your n8n instance (local or server). Please ensure it is installed and accessible in your system's PATH before running this workflow.\n\n### Required Credentials\n\n1.  **OpenWeatherMap:**\n    * Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your API key.\n    * Add the API key to your n8n OpenWeatherMap credentials.\n2.  **Google Calendar & Google AI (Gemini/TTS):**\n    * You will need Google OAuth2 credentials for the Google Calendar node.\n    * You will also need credentials for the Google AI services (Gemini and Text-to-Speech). Follow the n8n documentation to create and add these credentials.\n3.  **NewsAPI:**\n    * Get a free API key from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/).\n    * Add the API key to your n8n NewsAPI credentials.\n4.  **Telegram:**\n    * Create a new bot by talking to the `BotFather` in your Telegram app.\n    * Copy the **Bot Token** it provides and add it to your n8n Telegram credentials.\n    * Send a message to your new bot and get your **Chat ID** from the `Telegram Trigger` node or another method. You will need this for the `Telegram` send node.\n\n### Workflow Inputs\n\nIn the first node (or when you run the workflow manually), you must provide the following initial data:\n* `name`: Your first name for a personalized greeting.\n* `city`: The city for your local weather forecast (e.g., \"Amsterdam\").\n* `language`: The language for the entire podcast output (e.g., \"en-US\", \"nl-NL\", \"fa-IR\").\n* `news_keywords`: A comma-separated list of topics you are interested in for the news summary (e.g., \"n8n,AI,technology\").\n\n## How to Adapt the Template\n\nThis workflow is highly customizable. Here are several ways you can adapt it to fit your needs:\n\n### Triggers\n\n* **Automate It:** The default trigger is manual. Change it to a **Schedule Trigger** to have your podcast automatically generated and sent to you at the same time every morning (e.g., 7:00 AM).\n\n### Content Sources\n\n* **Weather:** In the \"User Weather Map\" node, you can change the forecast type or switch the units from metric to imperial.\n* **Calendar:** In the \"Get Today Meetings\" node, you can select a different calendar from your Google account (e.g., a shared work calendar instead of your personal one).\n* **News:**\n    * In the \"Get Headlines From News Sources\" node, change the country or category to get different top headlines.\n    * In the \"Get Links From Keywords\" node, update your keywords to track different topics.\n    * In the \"Aggregate Headlines\" (Gemini) node, you can modify the prompt to change the tone or length of the AI-generated news summary.\n\n### Audio Generation\n\n* **Voice & Language:** The `language` is a starting parameter, but you can go deeper into the Google TTS nodes (`Generate Virtual Parts`, etc.) to select specific voices, genders, and speaking rates to create a unique podcast host style.\n* **Scripting:** Modify the `Set` and `Merge` nodes that construct the final script. You can easily change the greeting, the transition phrases between sections, or the sign-off message.\n\n### Delivery\n\n* **Platform:** Don't use Telegram? Swap the `Telegram` node for a `Slack` node, `Discord` node, or even an `Email` node to send the MP3 file to your preferred platform.\n* **Message:** Customize the text message that is sent along with the audio file in the final node.",
