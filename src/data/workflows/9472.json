  "description": "# Human-in-the-Loop LinkedIn Post Generator (Telegram + AI)  \n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to build a **human-in-the-loop AI workflow** that helps you create professional LinkedIn posts via Telegram. The agent searches the web, drafts content, asks for your approval, and refines it based on your feedback — ensuring every post sounds polished and on-brand.  \n\n## Who’s it for  \n- Content creators and marketers who want to save time drafting LinkedIn posts.  \n- SaaS founders or solopreneurs who regularly share updates or insights.  \n- Anyone who wants an AI writing assistant with human control in the loop.  \n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts when you send a message to the Telegram bot asking it to write a LinkedIn post (e.g., “Write a LinkedIn post about AI in marketing”).  \n2. **Research**: The AI agent uses the Tavily tool to search the web and gather context for your topic.  \n3. **Drafting**: An AI model (OpenAI or Gemini) creates a professional LinkedIn post based on the findings.  \n4. **Human-in-the-loop**:  \n   - The bot sends the draft to you in Telegram and asks: “Good to go?”  \n   - If you approve → The post is saved to a Google Sheet, ready to publish.  \n   - If you disapprove and give feedback → The feedback is sent to a second AI agent that revises and improves the post.  \n   - The improved draft is sent back to you again for final approval.  \n5. **Finalization**: Once approved, the post is appended to a Google Sheet — your ready-to-post content library.  \n\nThis workflow combines AI creativity with human oversight to produce polished, authentic LinkedIn content every time.  \n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import this template into your n8n account.  \n2. Connect your **Telegram bot** (via Telegram Trigger and Send Message nodes).  \n3. Connect your **Google Sheets** account to store approved posts.  \n4. Set up your **AI model provider** (OpenAI or Gemini) and **Tavily API key** for web search.  \n5. Activate the workflow and start chatting with your AI writing assistant on Telegram!  \n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n account.  \n- Telegram bot token.  \n- OpenAI or Google Gemini account (for text generation).  \n- Tavily API key (for web search).  \n- Google Sheets account (for saving approved posts).  \n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- **Post Tone**: Adjust AI prompts to match your personal voice (professional, storytelling, inspirational, etc.).  \n- **Approval Logic**: Modify the approval step to allow multiple revision loops or add a “draft-only” mode.  \n- **Storage Options**: Instead of Google Sheets, save approved posts to Notion, Airtable, or your CMS.  \n- **Multi-platform**: Extend the same logic for X (Twitter) or Threads by changing the final output destination.  \n- **Branding**: Add your brand guidelines or preferred hashtags to the AI prompts for consistent style.  \n\n---\n\nThis template helps you write better LinkedIn posts faster — keeping you in full control while AI does the heavy lifting.  \n",
