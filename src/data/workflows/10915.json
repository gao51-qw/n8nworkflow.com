(The one in the template is a temporary example).\n\n## Setup Steps\n1.  **Add LINE Credentials:** In the \"Send to LINE via HTTP\" node, edit the \"Authorization\" header to include your own LINE Messaging API Bearer Token.\n2.  **Add User IDs:** In the \"Prepare LINE API Payload\" (Code) node, edit the `userIds` array to add all the LINE User IDs you want to send messages to.\n3.  **Update Data API:** The URL in the \"Get Nikkei 225 Data\" node is a temporary example. Replace it with your own persistent API URL (e.g., from a public provider or your own server).\n\n## Customization Options\n* **Change Schedule:** Edit the \"Every Weekday at 4 PM JST\" node to run at a different time. (Note: 4 PM JST is 07:00 UTC, which is what the Cron `0 7 * * 1-5` means).\n* **Change Message Format:** Edit the `message` variable inside the \"Prepare LINE API Payload\" (Code) node to change the text of the LINE message.",
