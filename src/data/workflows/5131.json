  "description": "# 🌟 Your Conversational GoHighLevel CRM Assistant: Instantly manage contacts, deals, and tasks in GoHighLevel using simple chat commands.\n\n![Screenshot 20250621 at 19.12.26.png](fileId:1560)\n\n---\n## 🚀 Overview\n\nThis automation sets up an intelligent AI assistant directly connected to your GoHighLevel CRM. Instead of clicking through menus and forms, you can now manage your entire sales pipeline through a simple chat conversation. It's like having a dedicated, 24/7 sales operations expert on your team, ready to act on your commands instantly.\n\n## 😩 The Problem\n\nManaging a powerful CRM like GoHighLevel is essential, but it can be incredibly time-consuming. You're constantly jumping between screens to add a new contact after a call, update a deal's status, create a follow-up task, or check calendar availability. Each small action requires navigating different menus, filling out multiple fields, and saving your work. This constant context-switching kills productivity, creates opportunities for human error, and slows down your entire sales cycle.\n\n## ✨ The Solution\n\nThis workflow acts as your personal \"automated employee,\" transforming your GoHighLevel experience by giving you an AI-powered conversational assistant. Now, you can simply tell the AI what you need in plain English, and it gets done.\n\nWhen you send a message like, **\"Create a new contact for John Doe at john@email.com\"** the automation instantly captures the information and creates the contact. Ask it to **\"Find all open deals for ABC Corp\"** and it will search your pipeline. Need to schedule a follow-up? Just say **\"Create a task to call John Doe next Tuesday.\"** 📅 This assistant handles everything from contact creation and opportunity management to task setting and appointment booking, turning tedious CRM admin into a fast and simple conversation.\n\n## ⚙️ Simple Setup\n\nThis workflow is a pre-built blueprint, designed to be up and running in minutes!\n\n* **1. Upload:** Simply upload the provided JSON file into your n8n instance.\n* **2. Connect:** Connect your app credentials (e.g., your GoHighLevel and OpenAI accounts). The workflow will show you exactly where.\n* **3. Activate:** Turn the workflow on, and it's ready to go! Let your new automated employee get to work.\n\n---\n🌐 Explore more workflows\n❤️ Buy more workflows at: [adamcrafts](https://adamcrafts.cloudysoftwares.com)\n🦾 Custom workflows at: [adamcrafts@cloudysoftwares.com](mailto:adamcrafts@cloudysoftwares.com)\n[adamaicrafts@gmail.com](mailto:adamaicrafts@gmail.com)\n\n\n&gt; Build once, customize endlessly, and scale your video content like never before.\n",
