When you visit this node's Production URL in a browser, it triggers the workflow.\n2.  **Respond with HTML:** The `Respond to Webhook` node is configured to send a response back to the browser.\n    *   **Content-Type Header:** It sets a crucial response header, `Content-Type: text/html`, which tells the browser to render the response as a webpage, not just plain text.\n    *   **HTML Body:** The entire HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the webpage is pasted directly into the `Body` field of this node.\n\nWhen activated, visiting the webhook URL will instantly display the custom webpage.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: &lt; 1 minute**\n\nThis workflow is ready to use out-of-the-box.\n\n1.  **Activate the workflow.**\n2.
