  "description": "[Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIfT9e-zPO0)\n\nThis n8n workflow helps you identify trending videos within your niche by detecting outlier videos that significantly outperform a channel's average views. It automates the process of monitoring competitor channels, saving time and streamlining content research.\n\n## Included in the Workflow\n\n- Automated Competitor Video Tracking\nMonitors videos from specified competitor channels, fetching data directly from the YouTube API.\n\n- Outlier Detection Based on Channel Averages\nCompares each video’s performance against the channel’s historical average to identify significant spikes in viewership.\n\n- Historical Video Data Management\nStores video statistics in a PostgreSQL database, allowing the workflow to only fetch new videos and optimize API usage.\n\n- Short Video Filtering\nAutomatically removes short videos based on duration thresholds.\n\n- Flexible Video Retrieval\nFetches up to 3 months of historical data on the first run and only new videos on subsequent runs.\n\n- PostgreSQL Database Integration\nIncludes SQL queries for database setup, video insertion, and performance analysis.\n\n- Configurable Outlier Threshold\nFocuses on videos published within the last two weeks with view counts at least twice the channel's average.\n\n- Data Output for Analysis\nOutputs best-performing videos along with their engagement metrics, making it easier to identify trending topics.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n installed on your machine or server\n\n- A valid YouTube Data API key\n\n- Access to a PostgreSQL database\n\nThis workflow is intended for educational and research purposes, helping content creators gain insights into what topics resonate with audiences without manual daily monitoring.",
