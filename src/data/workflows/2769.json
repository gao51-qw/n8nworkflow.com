  "description": "![Gravity Forms WF.png](fileId:1066)\n\n**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n**How It Works**  \n\nGravity Forms Customer Feedback Form Integration: This workflow streamlines the process of handling customer feedback submitted via Gravity Forms. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates with KlickTipp.  \n\nData Transformation: Input data is validated and transformed to meet KlickTipp’s API requirements, including formatting phone numbers and converting dates.  \n\n**Key Features**  \n\n**Gravity Forms Trigger**  \n- Captures new form submissions from Gravity Forms via a webhook and initiates the workflow.  \n\n**Data Processing and Transformation**  \n- Formats and validates essential data:  \n  - Converts phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  \n  - Transforms dates (e.g., birthdays) to UNIX timestamps.  \n  - Calculates and scales numeric responses (e.g., webinar ratings).  \n  - Parses webinar selections into timestamps for structured scheduling.  \n\n**Subscriber Management in KlickTipp**  \n- Adds or updates contacts in a KlickTipp subscriber list.  \n- Includes custom field mappings such as:  \n  - Personal details (name, email, birthday, phone number).  \n  - Feedback and preferences (e.g., webinar ratings, chosen sessions).  \n  - Structured answers from form responses.\n- Tags contacts for segmentation: Adds fixed and dynamic tags to contacts.\n  \n\n**Error Handling**  \n- Ensures invalid or empty data is handled gracefully, preventing workflow interruptions.  \n\n**Setup Instructions**  \n\n**Install and Configure Nodes:**  \n- Set up the Webhook, Set, and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.  \n- Authenticate your Gravity Forms and KlickTipp accounts.  \n\n**Prepare Custom Fields in KlickTipp:**  \n- Create fields in KlickTipp to align with the form submission data, such as:  \n\n| **Field Name**                               | **Field Type**   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Gravityforms \\| URL Linkedin                 | URL              |\n| Gravityforms \\| Course/webinar start timestamp | Date & Time      |\n| Gravityforms \\| Course/webinar rating        | Decimal Number   |\n| Gravityforms \\| Feedback                     | Text             |\n| Gravityforms \\| Contact permission           | Text             |\n\nAfter creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don’t appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  \n\n**Field Mapping and Adjustments:**  \nVerify and customize field assignments in the workflow to align with your specific form and subscriber list setup.  \n\n**Workflow Logic**  \n\n1. **Trigger via Gravity Forms Submission:**  \n   The workflow begins when a new form submission is received through the webhook.  \n\n2. **Transform Data for KlickTipp:**  \n   Formats and validates raw form data for compatibility with KlickTipp’s API.  \n\n3. **Add to KlickTipp Subscriber List:**  \n   Adds processed data as a new subscriber or updates an existing one.  \n\n4. **Get all tags from KlickTipp and create a list:** Fetches all existing Tags and turns them into an array\n\n5. **Define tags to dynamically set for contacts:** Definiton of variables that are received from the form submission and should be converted into tags\n\n6. **Merge tags of both lists:**\nChecks whether the list of existing tags in KlickTipp contains the tags which should be dynamically set based on the form submission\n\n7. **Tag creation and tagging contacts:** Creates new tags if it previously did not exist and then tags the contact\n\n\n**Benefits**  \n\n**Efficient lead generation:** Contacts from forms are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  \n**Automated processes:** Experts can start workflows directly, such as welcome emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  \n**Error-free data management:** The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  \n\n**Testing and Deployment**  \n\nTest the workflow by filling the form on Gravity Forms and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  \n\n**Notes**  \n\n**Customization:** Update field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup. This ensures accurate data syncing.  \n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Gravity Forms KlickTipp Knowledge Base help article](https://www.klicktipp.com/de/support/wissensdatenbank/gravity-forms-integration-n8n/)\n- [Use KlickTipp Community Node in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/install-klicktipp-node-n8n/)\n- [Automate Workflows: KlickTipp Integration in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/klicktipp-integration-n8n/)\n",
