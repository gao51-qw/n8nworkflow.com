Retrieve all manufactures from a Google Sheet\n2. Add each manufacture via Shopware sync API Endpoint to Shopware\n3. Upload a logo for each manufacture from a provided public URL to Shopware\n\n## Set Up Steps\n1. Add your Shopware url to first node called Settings\n2. Create a Google Sheet in your Google account with the following columns ([Demo Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qmsjs8usT90fPNnCIaI605W77zoKkOB3t3i8UsdpA5Q/edit?usp=sharing))\n\t1. name (the name of the manufacturer which has to be unique and is required)\n\t2. website (url to the manufacturer website) \n\t3. description \n\t4. logo_url (public manufcaturer logo url. Have to be a png, jpg or svg file) \n\t5. translation_language_code_1 (optional. Language Code of your language. For example 'es-ES' for spanish. You have to make sure a language with this code exists in your Shopware shop.)\n\t6. translation_name_1 (optional. Manufacturer name translated to the language you defined at translation_language_code_1)\n\t7. translation_description_1 (optional. Manufacturer description translated to the language you defined at translation_language_code_1)\n\t8. translation_language_code_2 (optional. Same as translation_language_code_1 for another language)\n\t9. translation_name_2 (optional. Same as translation_name_1 for another language)\n\t10. translation_description_2 (optional.

Connect to your Shopware account\n\t1. Create a [Shopware Integration](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/settings/system/integrationen)\n\t2. Connect to Shopware at the nodes \"Import Manufacturer\" and \"Upload Manufacturer Logo\" using a Generic OAuth2 API Authentication with Grant Type \"Client Credentials\".
