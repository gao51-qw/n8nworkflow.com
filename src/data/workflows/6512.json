You provide an image URL through a form interface, the API processes the image using advanced AI algorithms, and returns a clean image with the background removed. The processed image is then downloaded and ready for use.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Get your APImage API key:**\n   - Sign in to the [APImage Dashboard 🡥](https://apimage.org/dashboard) (or create a new APImage account)\n   - Copy your API key from the dashboard\n\n2. **Configure the API connection:**\n   - Double-click the **APImage Integration** node\n   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key (keep the `Bearer` prefix)\n\n3. **Test the workflow:**\n   - Click the **Remove Background** form trigger\n   - Enter an image URL in the form\n   - Submit to process the image\n\n4. **Set up output destination (optional):**\n   - Add nodes after the **Download** node to save images to your preferred storage\n   - Options include Google Drive, Dropbox, databases, or cloud storage\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n- [APImage 🡥](https://apimage.org) account and valid API key\n- Images accessible via public URLs for processing\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n**Replace Input Source:**\nSwap the Form Trigger with data from other sources like:\n- Database queries (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)\n- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)\n- Other APIs or webhooks\n- Airtable, Notion, or other productivity tools\n\n**Add Output Destinations:**\nConnect additional nodes after the Download step to save processed images to:\n- Cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3)\n- Databases for organized storage\n- Content management systems\n- Social media platforms\n- Email attachments\n\n**Batch Processing:**\nModify the workflow to process multiple images by connecting it to data sources that provide arrays of image URLs.\n\n**Add Image Validation:**\nInclude nodes to validate image URLs or file formats before processing to avoid API errors.\n\n## Workflow Structure\n\n```\nForm Trigger → APImage Integration → Download → [Your Output Destination]\n```\n\nThe Form Trigger collects image URLs, APImage Integration processes the background removal via API, Download retrieves the processed image, and you can add any output destination for the final images.\n\n## API Details\n\nThe workflow sends a POST request to `https://apimage.org/api/ai-remove-background` with:\n- **Authorization header:** Your API key\n- **image_url:** The URL of the image to process  \n- **async:** Set to false for immediate processing\n\nThe processed image is returned with a transparent background and downloaded automatically.",
