  "description": "# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Google Sheets & OpenAI\n\n## 🚀 Quick Implementation Steps\n\n**Automated customer feedback analyzer**:\n\n- **Trigger**: Google Sheets triggers on new product review rows.\n- **Sentiment Analysis**: Review text sent to OpenAI.\n- **Writeback**: Resulting sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) is written back to the sheet.\n\nJust connect your credentials and sheet — you're ready to go!\n\n## 🔍 What It Does\n\nThis workflow automatically analyzes user-submitted product reviews and classifies them by sentiment using OpenAI’s powerful language models. It eliminates the need to manually sift through feedback by tagging each review with a sentiment score.\n\nThe sentiment result is then written back to the Google Sheet next to the original review, enabling you to get a fast, clear snapshot of overall customer perception, satisfaction and pain points. Whether you're monitoring 10 or 10,000 reviews, this process scales effortlessly and updates every minute.\n\n## 👤 Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is designed for:\n\n- **E-commerce teams** collecting user reviews.\n- **Product teams** monitoring customer feedback.\n- **Marketing teams** identifying promotable reviews.\n- **Support teams** watching for negative experiences.\n- **SaaS platforms**, apps, and survey tools managing structured text feedback.\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\nYou’ll need:\n\n- A Google Sheet with two columns: `Review` and `Sentiment`\n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n- OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4o-mini or GPT-3.5)\n- n8n instance with LangChain and OpenAI nodes enabled\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Google Sheets Trigger**: Watches for new rows every minute\n2. **OpenAI Integration**:\n   - Uses LangChain’s `Sentiment Analysis` node\n   - Passes review text into GPT-4o-mini via the `OpenAI Chat Model` node\n3. **Sheet Update**: The sentiment result (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) is written into the `Sentiment` column in the same row.\n\nSticky Notes included for better visual understanding inside the workflow editor.\n\n## 🛠️ Steps to Configure and Use\n\n### 1. Prepare Your Google Sheet\n\nMake sure your sheet is named `Sheet1` with the following structure:\n\n| Review                                | Sentiment |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Absolutely love it!                  |           |\n| Not worth the price.                 |           |\n\n### 2. Set Up Credentials\n\n- **Google Sheets**: OAuth2 credentials\n- **OpenAI**: API Key added via `OpenAI API` credential in n8n\n\n### 3. Import & Activate Workflow\n\n- Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n- Assign the proper credentials to the trigger and OpenAI nodes.\n- Activate the workflow.\n\n## 🧩 How To Customize\n\n- 🛎️ **Alerting**: Add Slack/Email nodes for negative sentiment alerts\n- 🔄 **Triggering**: Change the polling interval to real-time triggers (e.g., webhook)\n- 📊 **Extended Sentiment**: Modify sentiment categories (e.g., \"Mixed\", \"Sarcastic\")\n- 🧾 **Summary Report**: Add Cron + Aggregation nodes for daily/weekly summaries\n- 🧠 **Prompt Tuning**: Adjust system prompt for deeper or context-based sentiment evaluation\n\n## 🧱 Add‑ons (Optional Features)\n\n- Email Digest of Negative Reviews\n- Google Drive Logging\n- Team Notification via Slack\n- Summary to Notion, Airtable, or Google Docs\n\n## 📌 Use Case Examples\n\n- **Online Stores**: Auto-tag reviews for reputation monitoring\n- **Product Teams**: See which feature releases generate positive or negative buzz\n- **CX Dashboards**: Feed real-time sentiment to internal BI tools\n- **Marketing**: Extract glowing reviews for social proof\n- **Support**: Triage issues by flagging critical comments instantly\n\n*...and many more applications wherever text feedback is collected.*\n\n## 🧰 Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue                    | Possible Cause                              | Suggested Fix                                      |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Sentiment not updating  | Sheet credentials missing or misconfigured  | Reconnect Google Sheets OAuth2                   |\n| Blank sentiment         | Review column empty or misaligned           | Ensure proper column header & value present      |\n| OpenAI errors           | Invalid or expired API key                  | Regenerate API Key from OpenAI and re-auth       |\n| Workflow doesn’t run    | Polling settings incorrect                  | Confirm interval & document ID in trigger node   |\n\n## 🤝 Need Help?\n\nIf you need assistance for\n\n- ✅ Help setting up this workflow\n- ⚙️ Customizing prompts or output\n- 🚀 Automating your full review pipeline\n\n👉 Contact us today at WeblineIndia.
