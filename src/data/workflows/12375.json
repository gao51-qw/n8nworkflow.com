  "description": "# Community Contest Tracker (FB Comments) → Sentiment Analysis → Telegram Winner Alerts + Airtable Proof\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors a Facebook post, extracts comments, enforces a \"past winner\" blocklist, analyzes sentiment using AI to find positive entries, randomly selects a winner, stores them in Airtable and announces the result via Telegram.\n\nThis workflow runs every night to manage your daily community giveaways. It fetches fresh comments from a specific Facebook post and cross-references users against a list of previous winners stored in Airtable to ensure fairness. It uses OpenAI to filter for genuinely positive sentiment (removing spam), selects a random winner, saves the record and sends a celebratory announcement to your Telegram channel.\n\nYou receive:\n\n* **Daily automated comment collection**\n* **Fairness enforcement (Blocklist for past winners)**\n* **AI-powered sentiment filtering (Positive vibes only)**\n* **Automated winner selection & notification**\n\nIdeal for community managers and brand owners who want to run fair, high-engagement contests without manually reading hundreds of comments or tracking past winners in spreadsheets.\n\n### Quick Start – Implementation Steps\n\n1.  Add your **Facebook Graph API Credentials** in the HTTP Request node.\n2.  Connect and configure your **Airtable** base (Winners Table).\n3.  Add your **OpenAI API Key** for sentiment analysis.\n4.  Connect your **Telegram Bot** credentials and set the Chat ID.\n5.  Update the **Post ID** in the \"Get FB Comments\" node.\n6.  Activate the workflow — daily contest automation begins instantly.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow automates the entire lifecycle of a social media contest:\n\n1.  **Daily Trigger:** Runs automatically at 9:00 PM every day.\n2.  **Data Ingestion:** Fetches the latest comments from Facebook and the full list of past winners from Airtable simultaneously.\n3.  **Pre-Processing:**\n    * Creates a blocklist of users who won in the last 30 days.\n    * Filters out spam, short comments (e.g., single emojis) and blocklisted users.\n4.  **AI Analysis:**\n    * Uses GPT-4o-mini to analyze the text of eligible comments.\n    * Filters specifically for \"Positive\" sentiment.\n5.  **Selection:** Randomly picks one winner from the pool of positive comments.\n6.  **Storage:** Saves the winner's Name, Facebook ID and Comment to Airtable.\n7.  **Notification:**\n    * Sends a \"Winner Announcement\" to your public Telegram channel.\n    * If any errors occur (e.g., DB save fail), logs them to Supabase and alerts the Admin.\n\nThis ensures your contests are fair, spam-free and consistently managed with zero manual effort.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* Social Media Managers\n* Community Moderators\n* Digital Marketing Agencies\n* Brand Owners running daily giveaways\n* Influencers managing high-volume comment sections\n* Customer Experience teams rewarding positive feedback\n\n\n## To run this workflow, you will need\n\n* **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)\n* **Facebook Developer App** (Graph API Access Token)\n* **Airtable Base** + Personal Access Token\n* **OpenAI API Key** (or compatible LLM)\n* **Telegram Bot Token**\n* **Supabase Project** (Optional, for error logging)\n\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Daily Trigger** – The schedule node initiates the process.\n2.  **Fetch Data** – Comments are pulled from FB; Winners pulled from Airtable.\n3.  **Code Filter** – JavaScript node removes past winners and low-quality spam.\n4.  **Sentiment Analysis** – AI determines if the comment is Positive, Neutral or Negative.\n5.  **Pick Winner** – A randomized logic block selects one \"Positive\" user.\n6.  **Record Keeping** – The winner is officially logged in your database.\n7.  **Broadcast** – The winner is announced to the community via Telegram.\n\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1.  Import the provided n8n JSON file.\n2.  Open **Get FB Comments** node → Add credentials and paste your specific `Post ID`.\n3.  Open **Get Past Winners** node → Link to your Airtable \"Winners\" table.\n4.  Open **OpenAI Chat Model** node → Add your API Key.\n5.  Open **Create a record** (Airtable) → Map the fields:\n    * Name\n    * Facebook ID\n    * Date\n6.  Open **Send a text message** (Telegram) → Add your Chat ID (e.g., `@mychannel`).\n7.  Activate the workflow — done!\n\n\n## How To Customize Nodes\n\n### Customize Filtering Logic\n\nModify the **Pre-Filter (Blocklist)** Code node:\n\n* Change the minimum character length (default is 2).\n* Adjust the \"Blocklist\" duration (e.g., allow users to win again after 7 days instead of 30).\n\n### Customize AI Criteria\n\nModify the **Sentiment Analysis** or **OpenAI** prompt:\n\n* Look for \"Creative\" or \"Humorous\" comments instead of just \"Positive\".\n* Filter for specific keywords related to your brand.\n\n### Customize Notifications\n\nReplace Telegram with:\n\n* **Slack** (for internal team updates).\n* **Discord** (for gaming communities).\n* **Email** (SMTP/Gmail) to notify the marketing team.\n\n### Customize Storage\n\nReplace Airtable with:\n\n* Google Sheets\n* Notion\n* PostgreSQL / MySQL\n\n\n## Add-Ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\nYou can extend this workflow to:\n\n* **Auto-Reply:** Use the Facebook API to reply to the winner's comment automatically (\"Congrats! DM us to claim.\").\n* **Image Generation:** Use OpenAI DALL-E or Bannerbear to generate a \"Winner Certificate\" image.\n* **Cross-Posting:** Automatically post the winner's name to Twitter/X or LinkedIn.\n* **Sentiment Report:** Create a weekly summary of overall community sentiment (Positive vs Negative ratio).\n* **Prize Tiering:** Assign different prizes based on the quality of the comment.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n### 1. Daily Product Giveaways\n\nReward one user every day who comments why they love your product.\n\n### 2. Feedback Drives\n\nEncourage users to leave constructive feedback and reward the most helpful positive comment.\n\n### 3. Community Engagement\n\nKeep your group active by automating \"Best Comment of the Day\" rewards.\n\n### 4. Brand Loyalty Programs\n\nTrack \"Super Fans\" by counting how many times they participate (even if they don't win).\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **No comments found** | Invalid Post ID or Token | Check Facebook Graph API token and Post ID. |\n| **No winner selected** | No positive comments | AI found no \"Positive\" sentiment. Check prompt or input data. |\n| **Airtable Error** | Field Mismatch | Ensure column names in Airtable match exactly (Name, Facebook ID). |\n| **Telegram Error** | Bot Permissions | Ensure the Bot is an Admin in the channel. |\n| **Workflow Stuck** | API Rate Limit | Check OpenAI or Facebook API usage limits. |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you need help customizing or extending this workflow, adding multi-platform support (Instagram/YouTube), integrating complex prize logic or setting up advanced dashboards, feel free to [hire n8n automation developers](https://www.weblineindia.com/hire-n8n-developers/) at **WeblineIndia**.
