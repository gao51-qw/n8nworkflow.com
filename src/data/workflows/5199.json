  "description": "![finetuning gpt4o.PNG](fileId:1577)\n\n*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* \n\nThis workflow automates the process of scraping product data from e-commerce websites and using it to fine-tune a custom OpenAI GPT model for generating high-quality marketing copy and product descriptions.\n\n### Main Use Cases\n\n* [Fine-tune OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) with real product data from hundreds of supported e-commerce websites for marketing content generation.\n* Create custom AI models specialized in writing compelling product descriptions across different industries and platforms.\n* Automate the entire pipeline from data collection to model training using Bright Data's extensive scraper library.\n* Generate marketing copy using your custom-trained model via an interactive chat interface.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe workflow operates in two main phases: model training and model usage, organized into these stages:\n\n1. **Data Collection & Processing**\n   * Manually triggered to start the fine-tuning process.\n   * Uses [Bright Data's web scraper](https://brightdata.com/products/web-scraper) to extract product information from any supported e-commerce platform (Amazon, eBay, Shopify stores, Walmart, Target, and hundreds of other websites).\n   * Collects product titles, brands, features, descriptions, ratings, and availability status from your chosen platform.\n   * Easily customizable to scrape from different websites by simply changing the dataset configuration and product URLs.\n\n2. **Training Data Preparation**\n   * A Code node processes the scraped product data to create training examples in OpenAI's required JSONL format.\n   * For each product, generates a complete training example with:\n     * System message defining the AI's role as a marketing assistant.\n     * User prompt containing specific product details (title, brand, features, original description snippet).\n     * Assistant response providing an ideal marketing description template.\n   * Compiles all training examples into a single JSONL file ready for OpenAI fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Model Fine-Tuning**\n   * Uploads the training file to OpenAI using the OpenAI File Upload node.\n   * Initiates a fine-tuning job via HTTP Request to OpenAI's fine-tuning API using the GPT-4o-mini model as the base.\n   * The fine-tuning process runs on OpenAI's servers to create your custom model.\n\n4. **Interactive Chat Interface**\n   * Provides a chat trigger that allows real-time interaction with your fine-tuned model.\n   * An AI Agent node connects to your custom-trained OpenAI model.\n   * Users can chat with the model to generate product descriptions, marketing copy, or other content based on the training.\n\n5. **Custom Model Integration**\n   * The OpenAI Chat Model node is configured to use your specific fine-tuned model ID.\n   * Delivers responses trained on your product data for consistent, high-quality marketing content.\n\n### Summary Flow:\n\nManual Trigger → Scrape E-commerce Products (Bright Data) → Process & Format Training Data (Code) → Upload Training File (OpenAI) → Start Fine-Tuning Job (HTTP Request) | Parallel: Chat Trigger → AI Agent → Custom Fine-Tuned Model Response\n\n### Benefits:\n\n* Fully automated pipeline from raw product data to trained AI model.\n* Works with hundreds of different e-commerce websites through Bright Data's extensive scraper library.\n* Creates specialized models trained on real e-commerce data for authentic marketing copy across various industries.\n* Scalable solution that can be adapted to different product categories, niches, or websites.\n* Interactive chat interface for immediate access to your custom-trained model.\n* Cost-effective fine-tuning using OpenAI's most efficient model (GPT-4o-mini).\n* Easily customizable with different websites, product URLs, training prompts, and model configurations.\n\n### Setup Requirements:\n\n* Bright Data API credentials for web scraping (supports hundreds of e-commerce websites).\n* OpenAI API key with fine-tuning access.\n* Replace placeholder credential IDs and model IDs with your actual values.\n* Customize the product URLs list and Bright Data dataset for your specific website and use case.\n* The workflow can be adapted for any e-commerce platform supported by Bright Data's scraping infrastructure.\n",
