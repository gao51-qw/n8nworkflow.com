It demonstrates practical API-to-API integration by connecting the Meteosource weather API directly to Gmail using n8n's HTTP Request node, without requiring a pre-built Meteosource integration.\n\n## Why This Workflow is Valuable\n\nInstead of manually checking weather forecasts each morning, this automation fetches current and next-day weather summaries from Meteosource and delivers them directly to your inbox. It's a perfect example of how direct API integration unlocks tools that don't have dedicated n8n nodes, giving you access to the full functionality of any service with an API.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Scheduled daily execution at 7:00 AM (customizable)\n- Fetches weather data using the Meteosource API with secure Query Auth credentials\n- Sends formatted email with today's weather in the subject and tomorrow's forecast in the body\n- Easy location and recipient customization through a Config node\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n**Meteosource API Account**: Sign up for a free account at [Meteosource](https://www.meteosource.com/) to get your API key (includes 400 free calls per day, more than enough for daily forecasts).\n\n**Credentials needed**:\n- **Meteosource credentials**: Create an HTTP Query Auth credential in n8n with the parameter name `key` and your Meteosource API key as the value\n- **Gmail OAuth2**: Connect your Gmail account to n8n for sending emails\n\n## Configuration\n\nOpen the **Config** node to personalize:\n- **place_id**: Change from \"london\" to your desired location (use Meteosource place ID format)\n- **send_to_email**: Update with your preferred recipient email address\n\nThis workflow demonstrates the power of the HTTP Request node for connecting any API to your automation workflows.",
