It's particularly valuable for organizations managing multiple API integrations, SaaS providers monitoring client integrations, and development teams implementing API monitoring strategies. \n\n## Requirements\n\n- **MCP Client**: Any MCP-compatible application (Claude Desktop, custom MCP client, or other AI tools)\n- **Network Access**: Outbound HTTP/HTTPS access to test API endpoints and webhooks\n- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for securing the MCP server endpoint\n- **Target APIs**: The APIs and webhooks you want to monitor (no special configuration required on target systems)\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Configure MCP Server Authentication** - Update the **MCP Server - API Monitor Entry** node with your desired authentication method and generate a secure bearer token for accessing your MCP server\n\n2. **Deploy the Workflow** - Save and activate the workflow in your n8n instance, noting the MCP server endpoint URL that will be generated for external client connections\n\n3. **Connect MCP Client** - Configure your MCP client (such as Claude Desktop) to connect to the MCP server endpoint using the authentication token you configured\n\n4. **Test Monitoring Tools** - Use your MCP client to call the available tools: Analyze Api Health, Validate Webhook Reliability, Monitor API Limits, Verify Authentication, and Generate Client Report with your API endpoints and credentials\n\n",
