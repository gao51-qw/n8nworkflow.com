  "description": "## Manage Jira Issues with Natural Language via Telegram and GPT-4o  \n## Overview\nThe Jira Agent is an AI-powered assistant that allows users to interact with Jira directly through messaging platform Telegram. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o model to interpret natural language commands and perform various Jira-related actions. On Telegram, it enables users to create Jira stories by triggering a guided form when prompted with \"create story.\" Additionally, it provides more extensive functionality, including creating, updating, searching, and transitioning Jira issues through natural language commands.\n\n## How it works\n**Normal interaction** \nUsing messages as \"Please give all my issues\".\n\n**Standardized process of creating stories:** \n1. Message: \"create story\"\n2. Open the Form that Telegram responds back to you\n3. Fill in the essential story information in the form\n4. The story automatically gets created in your backlog. \n\n## Required Connections\nTo use the Jira Agent effectively, users need access to:\n- A Telegram account, Telegram setup involves deploying the bot and starting a chat; story creation is triggered with a simple text command.\n- A connected Jira workspace\n- Permissions to create and modify Jira issue\n- Access to GPT-4o API-key\n\n*Detailed configuration instructions are provided in the workflow*\n\n## Setup Time\n&lt;15 minutes\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n- Try adding more details to the form for more complete Jira ticket creation.\n- Try connecting a Google Calendar node to plan your work",
