They are responsible for planning the work for the rest of the team.\n\n- **Squad of Research Analysts** is the second part of the workflow. They execute the plan created.\n\n- **Senior Editor** is the third part of the workflow.  They polish the draft report and send it to publish\n\nThis template uses a custom tool that is able to answer the SEC 10K questions from the Research team.  \n\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Setup the Stock Q&A Workflow for the company you want to analyze using this [template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2183-ai-crew-to-automate-fundamental-stock-analysis-qanda-workflow/)\n\n2.
