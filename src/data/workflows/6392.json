Set it up once and enjoy *worry-free* workflow versioning and disaster recovery! 🔄✨\n\n## 📝 What This Workflow Does\n\n- **Schedules backups**: Triggers the workflow automatically every 6 hours—no manual steps needed. ⏰\n- **Exports all current workflows**: Collects a JSON snapshot of every workflow in your n8n instance. 📦\n- **Pushes backups to GitHub**: Commits each backup file to your specified GitHub repository with a time-stamped commit message for easy tracking. 🗂️🚀\n- **Smart file handling**: Checks if a backup file already exists and creates or updates as needed, keeping your repository clean and organized. 🤖\n\n## ⚡️ Why Use This Template?\n\n- **Automate your workflow backups – never miss a backup again!**\n- **Seamless integration with GitHub** for team collaboration, change management, and rollback.\n- **Simple, reliable, and fully customizable** to match your backup intervals and repository setup.\n- **Peace of mind** that your critical automation assets are always protected.\n\n## 📦 How the Template Works: Step-by-step Overview\n\n1. **Scheduled Trigger**: Fires every 6 hours to launch the backup sequence.\n2. **Get All Workflows**: Uses the `HTTP Request` node to fetch all n8n workflows from your instance as JSON data.\n3. **Move Binary Data**: Converts the JSON into a binary format, ready for GitHub storage.\n4. **Edit/Create Backup File**: Attempts to edit (update) an existing backup file in your GitHub repo. If the file does not exist, the workflow will create a new one.\n5. **Conditional Logic**: Checks after each run whether the backup file exists and ensures previous versions can be recovered or merged as needed.\n6. **Repeat**: The process auto-loops every 6 hours—no further intervention required!\n\n## 🔧 How To Set Up On Your Server\n\n1. **Import the template** into your n8n instance.\n2. **Configure your GitHub credentials** in the workflow nodes.\n3. **Update the GitHub repository details** (`owner`, `repository`, and `filePath`) to use your own repo and desired file path.\n4. **Set your n8n API key** and update the API endpoint URL to match your deployment.\n5. **Save and activate** the workflow—now your backups are on autopilot!\n\n## 👨‍💻 Example Use Cases\n\n- Version control for rapidly changing automation environments.\n- Safeguarding business-critical automation assets.\n- Easy rollback in case of workflow corruption or accidental deletion.\n- Team collaboration through GitHub's pull request and review process.\n\n### 🌟 Pro Tips\n\n- Adjust the backup interval in the `Schedule Trigger` node if you require more/less frequent backups.\n- Use GitHub branch protection rules for enhanced workflow security.\n- Pair this backup workflow with notifications (e.g., Slack or Email) for backup alerts.\n\n**Protect your n8n workflows with automated, reliable, and versioned GitHub backups—set it and forget it!** 🚦🔒",
