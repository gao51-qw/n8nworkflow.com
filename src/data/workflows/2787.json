Create a free Bitbucket account and private repository\n2. Create a Bitbucket App Password with repository write access\n3. Add Bitbucket credentials to n8n (using your username and app password)\n4. Set up n8n API access (generate API key in your n8n instance)\n5. Configure your Bitbucket workspace and repository names in the Set node\n6. Optional: Adjust the backup schedule (default: 2 AM daily)\n\n### Perfect for n8n self-hosters who want:\n* Version control for their workflows\n* Automated daily backups\n* Free private repository storage\n* Easy workflow recovery\n* Change tracking over time\n\nThe workflow includes basic error handling and rate limiting to ensure reliable backups even with larger numbers of workflows.
