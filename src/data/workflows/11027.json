The AI determines a sentiment score (1-5), categorizes the issue (Quality, Design, Shipping, etc.), summarizes the complaint, and proposes a concrete improvement plan.\n3. **Formatting:** A Code node parses the AI's response to ensure it is in a clean JSON format.\n4. **Storage:** The structured data is appended as a new row in a Google Sheet.\n5. **Notification:** A Slack message is sent to your specified channel to confirm the batch analysis is complete.\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements\n- **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n- **Apify Account:** You need to rent the `junglee/amazon-reviews-scraper` actor.\n- **Google Cloud Account:** For accessing the Gemini (PaLM) API and Google Sheets API.\n- **Slack Account:** For receiving notifications.\n\n## 🚀 How to set up\n1. **Apify Config:** Enter your Apify API token in the credentials. In the \"Run an Actor\" node, update the `startUrls` to the Amazon product page you want to analyze.\n2. **Google Sheets:** Create a new Google Sheet with the following header columns: `sentiment_score`, `category`, `summary`, `improvement`. Copy the Spreadsheet ID into the Google Sheets node.\n3. **AI Prompt:** The \"Message a model\" node contains the prompt. It is currently set to output results in **Japanese**.
