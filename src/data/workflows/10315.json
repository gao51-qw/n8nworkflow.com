It compares the original and back-translation to estimate a quality score and summarizes differences. A Google Docs report is generated, and a Slack message posts the score, difference count, and report link—so teams can triage quickly.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Connect credentials for Google Drive, DeepL, and Slack.\n2. Point the Google Drive Trigger to your “incoming JP docs” folder.\n3. In the **Workflow Configuration (Set)** node, fill `targetFolder` (report destination) and `slackChannel`.\n4. Run once, then activate and drop a test doc.\n\n## Requirements\n\nn8n (Cloud or self-hosted), Google Drive, DeepL, and Slack credentials; two Drive folders (incoming, reports).\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\nTune the diff logic (character → token/line level, normalization rules), adjust score thresholds and Slack formatting, or add reviewer routing/Jira creation for low-score cases. Always avoid hardcoded secrets; keep user-editable variables in the Set node.",
