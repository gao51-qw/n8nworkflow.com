The workflow uses a combination of a Schedule Trigger, some code that determines what day of the week it is (no posting Friday - Sunday), a prompts node to set your OpenAI prompts, a random selection of a prompt so that you are not generating content that looks repetitive. We send that all to OpenAI API, select a random time, have the final LinkedIn post sent to your Telegram for approval, once approved wait for the correct time slot, and then Post to your LinkedIn account using the LinkedIn node.\n\n## How it works:\n\nRun or schedule the workflow in n8n\nThe automation can be triggered manually or on a custom schedule (excluding weekends if needed).\n\nYou should customize the prompts in the Prompt Node to suit your needs.\n\nA random LinkedIn post prompt is selected\nPre-written prompts are rotated to keep content fresh and non-repetitive.\n\nOpenAI generates the LinkedIn post\nThe prompt is sent to OpenAI via API, and the result is returned in clean, ready-to-use form.\n\nYou receive the draft via Telegram.\nThe post is sent to Telegram for quick approval or review.\n\nPost is scheduled or published via the LinkedIn Connector\n\nOnce approved, the workflow delays until the target time, then sends the content to LinkedIn.\n\n## What's needed:\nAn OpenAPI API key, LinkedIn Account, and a Telegram Account.\n\n## For Telegram you will need to configure the Bot service.\n\nStep-by-Step: Telegram Approval for Your Workflow\nA.
