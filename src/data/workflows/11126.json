In \"Query Parameters,\" change the value of `q` to the name of the voice actor or person you want to track.\n2. **Connect Calendar:** Open the 'Create an event' node. Select your Google Calendar credentials and choose the Calendar ID where events should be created.\n3. **Test:** Run the workflow manually to populate your calendar.\n\n## Requirements\n- An active n8n instance.\n- A Google account (for Google Calendar).\n- No API Key is required for Jikan API (Public), but rate limiting logic must be preserved.\n\n## How to customize\n- **Change the Filter:** Modify the 'Check if Not Aired' node to track \"Currently Airing\" shows instead of upcoming ones.\n- **Enrich Event Details:** Update the 'Create an event' node to include the MyAnimeList URL or synopsis in the calendar event description.\n- **Search Different Entities:** Adjust the API endpoint to search for Manga authors or specific Studios instead of voice actors.\n\n## Expected Result\nUpon successful execution, this workflow will:\n- Search for the specified voice actor.\n- Retrieve their upcoming anime roles.\n- Create events in your Google Calendar for anime that hasn't aired yet.\n\n**Example Calendar Entry:**\n- **Title:** Anime Name - Release Date\n- **Description:** Details regarding the release...",
