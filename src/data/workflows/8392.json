  "description": "## Customer Feedback Loop Analyzer (n8n Automated Workflow)\n\nThis workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback from forms and emails, analyzes it using AI, classifies it by category and sentiment, logs it into Google Sheets, and routes it to the right communication channels like Slack or email. It closes the feedback loop efficiently by ensuring every review is categorized, tracked, and acted upon.\n\n\n## Who’s it for\n\n* Product managers wanting structured customer insights\n* Customer support teams needing fast issue routing\n* Engineering teams who want to be alerted to bugs quickly\n* Growth & UX teams tracking feature requests and usability feedback\n* Any business managing customer feedback at scale\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Form submission trigger** captures reviews submitted via customer review forms.\n2. **Gmail trigger** listens for new feedback emails.\n3. **Extract details (Code node)** parses sender details and extracts the actual review text.\n4. **AI node (LLM)** summarizes the feedback, determines sentiment, and classifies it (Bug, Feature Request, UX Issue, Other).\n5. **Google Gemini (optional)** provides advanced classification/summarization.\n6. **Google Sheets node** logs all structured feedback for historical tracking.\n7. **Switch node** routes feedback into separate flows by category.\n8. **Slack node** instantly notifies the team of critical feedback (e.g., Bugs).\n9. **Email node** sends reports to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Feature Requests to product managers).\n\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\n2. Connect credentials for:\n\t* Gmail (for receiving/sending feedback)\n\t* Google Sheets (for logging reviews)\n\t* Slack (for real-time team alerts)\n3. Configure your Google Sheet (columns for Date, Reviewer, Sentiment, Category, Feedback).\n4. Adjust the AI node prompt to reflect your team’s preferred categories.\n5. Set Slack channels and email recipients for notifications.\n6. Activate workflow.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* n8n (cloud or self-hosted)\n* Gmail API access (OAuth2 connected in n8n)\n* Google Sheets API access\n* Slack webhook or OAuth connection\n* (Optional) Google Gemini or another LLM integration\n\n\n## How to customize\n\n* Modify the **AI prompt** to classify into different categories (e.g., “Support Issue”, “Billing Problem”).\n* Extend the Google Sheet schema to include product version, tags, or priority scores.\n* Add a **translation step** if feedback is multilingual.\n* Replace Slack notifications with Teams/Discord if needed.\n* Connect to Jira or Trello to auto-create tasks for certain categories.\n\n\n## Add-ons\n\n* **Sentiment-based alerts**: Trigger Slack notifications only if sentiment is negative.\n* **Monthly report generator**: Compile all feedback into a PDF and email it automatically.\n* **CRM integration**: Sync categorized feedback into HubSpot or Salesforce.\n* **Auto-response emails**: Acknowledge receipt of customer feedback via Gmail.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n* SaaS product team routes all Bug feedback directly to engineering Slack channel.\n* UX team receives only “UX Issue” categorized feedback for design improvements.\n* Marketing team logs Feature Requests into Google Sheets for roadmap prioritization.\n* Customer support automatically responds with a thank-you email for all submissions.\n\n\n## Common Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| Workflow doesn’t trigger | Gmail/Form node not authenticated | Reconnect Gmail / check webhook form integration |\n| No data extracted | Code node parsing wrong field | Update regex/parsing logic to match email format |\n| AI classification fails | Invalid LLM credentials or quota exceeded | Reconnect LLM node / check usage limits |\n| Feedback not logged | Wrong Google Sheet ID or missing sharing | Verify Sheet ID and grant access to connected account |\n| Slack messages not sent | Invalid webhook or channel not found | Reconfigure Slack node with valid channel/webhook |\n| Email reports fail | Gmail OAuth token expired | Refresh Gmail credentials in n8n |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nOur n8n automation experts at WeblineIndia can help you:\n\n* Fine-tune the AI prompts for better categorization accuracy\n* Build custom dashboards from your Google Sheet data\n* Add multilingual feedback handling\n* Connect to your ticketing system (Jira, Trello, Asana) for seamless issue tracking",
