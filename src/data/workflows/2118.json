Setup HubSpot Oauth2 creds (Be careful with scopes. They have to be exact, not less or more. Yes, it’s not simple, but it’s well documented in the n8n docs. Be smarter than me, read the docs)\n2. Setup Gmail creds.\n3. Change the email variables in the `Set keys` node\n\n## How to adjust this template\nThere's plenty to do here because the approach here is really just a starting point.
