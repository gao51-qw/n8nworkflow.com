  "description": "## Gmail Attachment Extractor to Google Drive\n\nDescription: This workflow monitors your Gmail inbox for new emails, specifically those with attachments, and automatically saves those attachments to a designated folder in your Google Drive.\n\nUse Case: Automatically archive invoices, client documents, reports, or photos sent via email to a structured cloud storage.\n\n## How It Works\nThis workflow operates in three main steps:\n\n**Gmail New Email Trigger**:\n\nThe workflow starts with a Gmail Trigger node, set to monitor for new emails in your specified Gmail inbox (e.g., your primary inbox).\n\nIt checks for emails that contain attachments.\n\nConditional Check (Optional but Recommended):\n\nAn If node checks if the email actually has attachments. This prevents errors if an email without an attachment somehow triggers the workflow.\n\n**Upload to Google Drive**:\n\nA Google Drive node receives the email data and its attachments.\n\nIt's configured to upload these attachments to a specific folder in your Google Drive.\n\nThe attachments are named dynamically based on their original filenames.\n\n## Setup Steps\nTo get this workflow up and running, follow these instructions:\n\nStep 1: Create Gmail and Google Drive Credentials in n8n\n\nIn your n8n instance, click on Credentials in the left sidebar.\n\nClick New Credential.\n\nSearch for and select \"Gmail OAuth2 API\" and follow the authentication steps with your Google account. Save it.\n\nClick New Credential again.\n\nSearch for and select \"Google Drive OAuth2 API\" and follow the authentication steps with your Google account. Save it.\n\nMake note of the Credential Names (e.g., \"My Gmail Account\", \"My Google Drive Account\").\n\nStep 2: Create a Destination Folder in Google Drive\n\nGo to your Google Drive (drive.google.com).\n\nCreate a new folder where you want to save the email attachments (e.g., Email Attachments Archive).\n\nCopy the Folder ID from the URL (e.g., https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE).",
