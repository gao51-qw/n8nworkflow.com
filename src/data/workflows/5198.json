  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow automates the process of checking for and applying updates to a self-hosted n8n instance running on Docker. It runs on a schedule, checks for new versions, summarizes the release notes with AI, and asks for your approval via Telegram before updating.\n\n1.  **Scheduled Check:** The workflow runs hourly, triggered by a `Schedule` node.\n2.  **Version Discovery:**\n    *   It first confirms it's running in a Docker environment.\n    *   It uses SSH to connect to the host machine and inspects the running n8n container to find its current version tag (e.g., `latest` or `next`).\n    *   It then queries the Docker Hub API to compare the image `digest` (a unique ID for an image version) of the running version against the latest available version for that tag.\n3.  **Update Detection:** If the digests do not match, it means a new image has been pushed for your version tag (e.g., a new `latest` image is available), and an update is needed.\n4.  **AI-Powered Release Notes:**\n    *   It fetches the official release notes for the new version from the GitHub API.\n    *   An AI model (LLM) summarizes these technical notes into a concise, human-readable overview of the key features and fixes.\n5.  **Manual Approval:** It sends a message to a Telegram chat with the AI-generated summary and two buttons: \"✅ Update\" and \"❌ Ignore\". The workflow then pauses and waits for your response.\n6.  **Execute Update:** If you approve the update, the workflow uses SSH to run a `docker compose` command on your server, which pulls the new image, stops the old containers, and starts the new ones.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~5-10 minutes**\n\n1.  **SSH Credentials:**\n    *   Go to **Credentials** and create a new **SSH** credential with the username, host, and password/private key for the server where your n8n Docker instance is running.\n    *   Select this credential in the **`Get n8n Current Version`** and **`Update Docker`** nodes.\n2.  **Telegram Bot Credentials:**\n    *   Create a Telegram Bot and get its API token.\n    *   Go to **Credentials** and create a new **Telegram** credential with your bot's token.\n    *   Select this credential in the **`Send a text message`** node.\n3.  **AI Model Credentials:**\n    *   Ensure you have credentials for an AI provider (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) set up.\n    *   Select your desired credential in the **`Google Gemini Chat Model`** node (or replace it with your preferred LLM node).\n4.  **Configure Paths and Commands:**\n    *   Open the **`Docker Path`** node. Set the `docker_path` to the absolute path of your `docker-compose.yml` file on the server (e.g., `/root/n8n`).\n    *   If you use workers, adjust the `worker_command` to include the correct `--scale` argument for your setup. If not, you can leave it blank.\n5.  **Set Your Chat ID:**\n    *   Open the **`Approve Update`** Telegram node and enter your personal Telegram Chat ID in the `Chat ID` field. This ensures the approval message is sent to you.\n6.  **Activate the workflow.** It will now check for updates every hour.\n\n**To enable fully automatic updates (without manual approval):** Delete the nodes from `Get n8n Releases` to `Approved ?` and connect the `Needs Update ?` node directly to the `Update Docker` node.",
