  "description": "# Create Video with HeyGen and Upload to YouTube\n\n## Overview\nThis workflow automates the process of creating an AI-generated avatar video using **HeyGen** and directly uploading it to **YouTube**. By sending text input via a webhook, the workflow generates a video with a chosen avatar and voice, waits for processing, downloads the completed file, and publishes it to your configured YouTube channel.  \n\nThis template is ideal for automating **content creation pipelines**, such as daily news updates, explainer videos, or narrated scripts, without manual intervention.\n\n---\n\n## Use Case\n- **Marketing teams**: Automate explainer or promotional video creation from text input.  \n- **Content creators**: Generate AI-based avatar videos for YouTube directly from scripts.  \n- **Organizations**: Streamline video generation for announcements, product updates, or tutorials.  \n\nInstead of recording and editing videos manually, this template allows you to **feed text content into a webhook** and have a ready-to-publish video on your YouTube channel within minutes.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow starts when text content and a title are sent to the webhook endpoint.  \n2. **Code Node**: Cleans and formats the input text by removing unnecessary newlines and returns it with the title.  \n3. **Set Node**: Prepares HeyGen parameters, including API key, avatar ID, voice ID, title, and content.  \n4. **HeyGen API Call**: Sends the request to generate a video with the provided avatar and voice.  \n5. **Wait Node**: Pauses briefly to allow HeyGen to process the video.  \n6. **Video Status Check**: Polls HeyGen to check whether the video has finished processing.  \n7. **Conditional Check**: If the video is still processing, it loops back to wait. Once complete, it moves forward.  \n8. **Download Node**: Retrieves the generated video file.  \n9. **YouTube Upload Node**: Uploads the video to your YouTube channel with the provided title and default settings.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- **HeyGen API Key**: Required to authenticate with HeyGen’s video generation API.  \n- **HeyGen Avatar & Voice IDs**: Unique identifiers for the avatar and voice you want to use.  \n- **YouTube OAuth2 Credentials**: Connected account for video uploads.  \n\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. **Import the Workflow**: Download and import this template JSON into your n8n instance.  \n2. **Configure the Webhook**: Copy the webhook URL from n8n and use it to send requests with `title` and `content`.  \n   - Example payload:  \n     ```json\n     {\n       \"title\": \"Tech News Update\",\n       \"content\": \"Today’s top story is about AI advancements in video generation...\"\n     }\n     ```  \n3. **Add HeyGen Credentials**:  \n   - Insert your HeyGen API key in the **Set Node** under `x-api-key`.  \n   - Provide your chosen `avatar_id` and `voice_id` from HeyGen. \n\t   - To find your HeyGen `avatar_id` and `voice_id`, first retrieve your API key from the [HeyGen dashboard](https://app.heygen.com/). With this key, you can use HeyGen’s API to look up available options: run a GET request to `https://api.heygen.com/v2/avatars` to see a list of avatars along with their `avatar_id`, and then run a GET request to `https://api.heygen.com/v2/voices` to see a list of voices with their `voice_id`. Once you’ve identified the avatar and voice you want to use, copy their IDs and paste them into the **Set HeyGen Parameters** node in your n8n workflow.\n\n4. **Set Up YouTube Credentials**:  \n   - Connect your YouTube account in n8n using OAuth2.  \n   - Ensure proper permissions are granted for video uploads.  \n\t   - To set up YouTube credentials in n8n, go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable **YouTube Data API v3**, and create an **OAuth Client ID** (choose *Web Application* and add the redirect URI: `https://&lt;your-n8n-domain&gt;/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`). Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, then in n8n create new credentials for **YouTube OAuth2 API**. Enter the values, authenticate with your Google account to grant upload permissions, and test the connection. Once complete, the YouTube node will be ready to upload videos automatically.\n\n5. **Activate the Workflow**: Once configured, enable the workflow. Sending a POST request to the webhook with title and content will trigger the full process.  \n\n---\n\n## Notes\n- You can adjust **video dimensions** (default: 1280x720) in the HeyGen API request.  \n- Processing time may vary depending on script length. The workflow uses a **wait-and-poll loop** until the video is ready.  \n- Default YouTube upload category is **Education (28)** and region is **US**. These can be customized in the YouTube node.  \n\n---\n",
