Make sure to add Gmail API with the modify scope.\n  - Add Google OAuth credentials in n8n. Make sure to add the n8n redirect URI to the   Google Cloud Console consent screen settings.\n- OpenAI Configuration: add OpenAI API Key in the credentials\n- Tweaking the prompt: edit the system prompt in the \"Generate email reply\" node to suit your needs\n\n## Detailed Walkthrough\nCheck out this [blog post](https://medium.com/@nchourrout/i-made-an-email-auto-responder-to-conquer-my-writers-block-aa2b91db6741) where I go into more details on how I built this workflow.\n\nReach out to me [here](https://flowful.ai/contact) if you need help building automations for your business.",
