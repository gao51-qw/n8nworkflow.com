It is designed for traders, analysts, and automation teams who want fast, auditable trade signals without manual chart monitoring or subjective interpretation.\nOn a fixed 5-minute schedule, the workflow fetches live price, volume, RSI, and EMA data for AAPL and combines them into a unified market snapshot. A deterministic computation layer derives clear trend and momentum signals, ensuring indicator logic remains transparent and non-AI. These signals are then evaluated by a strict, rule-based AI decision engine that returns a structured verdict—APPROVE, WAIT, or REJECT—along with confidence and a concise reason.\nTrade decisions are routed instantly to Telegram for real-time visibility and logged to Notion for historical analysis and auditability.
