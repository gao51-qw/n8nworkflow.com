  "description": "This workflow automates the process of **generating advertising (ADV)** images from multiple reference images and publishing them directly to social media (**Instagram** and **Facebook** with [Upload-Post](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app)) with **Seedream v4** AI.\n\nThis workflow automates the process of generating an AI image based on a user's text prompt and up to 6 reference images. The process is triggered by a user submitting a web form.\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n* ✅ **Automated Image Creation** – Generates high-quality, consistent visuals from multiple references without manual editing.\n* ✅ **Seamless Social Media Publishing** – Automatically posts to Instagram and Facebook with minimal effort.\n* ✅ **SEO-Optimized Titles** – Ensures your posts get better reach with AI-generated, keyword-friendly titles.\n* ✅ **Scalable Workflow** – Can be triggered manually, on schedule, or via form submissions.\n* ✅ **Time-Saving** – Reduces manual steps from design to publishing, enabling faster content production.\n* ✅ **Multi-Platform Support** – Easily extendable to other platforms (TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.) with Upload-Post API.\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1.  **Form Trigger:** A user fills out a form with a \"Prompt\" (text description) and a list of \"Reference images\" (comma-separated URLs).\n2.  **Data Processing:** The workflow converts the submitted image URL string into a proper array for the AI API.\n3.  **AI Image Generation:** The workflow sends the prompt and image URLs to the fal.ai API (specifically, the ByteDance `seedream` model) to generate a new, consistent image.\n4.  **Status Polling:** It periodically checks the status of the AI job until the image generation is `COMPLETED`.\n5.  **Result Retrieval:** Once complete, it fetches the URL of the generated image and downloads the image file itself.\n6.  **SEO Title Generation:** The original user prompt is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to generate an optimized, engaging social media title.\n7.  **Cloud Backup:** The generated image is uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder for storage.\n8.  **Social Media Posting:** Finally, the workflow posts the downloaded image file to both Instagram and Facebook via the Upload-Post.com API, using the AI-generated title.\n---\n\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo make this workflow functional, you need to configure several third-party services and their corresponding credentials within n8n.\n\n1.  **Obtain fal.ai API Key:**\n    *   Create an account at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/).\n    *   Locate your API key in your account settings.\n    *   In the **\"Create Video\"** and **\"Get status\"** nodes, edit the HTTP Header Auth credentials.\n    *   Set the Header `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Key YOUR_FAL_AI_API_KEY`.\n\n2.  **Configure Upload-Post.com API:**\n    *   Create an account at [Upload-Post.com](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app) and get your API key.\n    *   Create a profile within the Upload-Post app (e.g., `test1`); this profile manages your social account connections.\n    *   In both the **\"Post to Instagram\"** and **\"Post to Facebook\"** nodes, edit the HTTP Header Auth credentials.\n    *   Set the Header `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Apikey YOUR_UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY`.\n    *   **Crucially**, in the same nodes, find the `user` parameter in the body and replace the placeholder `YOUR_USERNAME` with the profile name you created (e.g., `test1`).\n\n3.  **Configure OpenAI/OpenRouter (Optional for Title Generation):**\n    *   The **\"Generate title\"** node uses an OpenAI-compatible API. The provided example uses OpenRouter.\n    *   Ensure you have valid credentials (e.g., for OpenRouter or directly for OpenAI) configured in n8n and selected in this node.\n\n4.  **Configure Google Drive (Optional for Backup):**\n    *   The **\"Upload Image\"** node requires Google OAuth credentials.\n    *   Set up a Google Cloud project, enable the Drive API, and create OAuth 2.0 credentials in the n8n settings.\n    *   Authenticate and select the desired destination folder in the node's parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).",
