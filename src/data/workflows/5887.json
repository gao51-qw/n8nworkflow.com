But you’ve probably experienced alert fatigue if you’ve ever received a flood of downtime emails for every tiny outage. These short hiccups are common, and most monitoring tools don’t let you filter them out.\n\nHere’s how you can set up **website downtime notifications with n8n** - no extra subscriptions, and no more false positives spamming your inbox. For your most important sites, you can even get direct text alerts to your phone.\n\nWe’ll use **n8n**, a powerful automation tool with thousands of templates and integrations. You can run it in the cloud or even self-host it for free.\n\n---\n\n### Why Use n8n for Website Monitoring?\n\nUptime Robot and similar services have limitations or get expensive fast if you monitor several sites. n8n gives you full control - you choose when and *how* you get notified, set your own timing and thresholds, and you aren’t stuck with default alert logic.\n\nPlus, n8n can automate much more than just uptime monitoring: use it to handle other business workflows too.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start: Free n8n Website Monitoring Template\n\n- Use the template to get started fast.\n- Log in or sign up for n8n Cloud, or self-host for free if you prefer.\n- Configure your schedule (default: hourly) and list the sites you want to monitor.\n- Key setting: **wait seconds**. Recommended: 300 seconds (5 minutes). If your site goes down, the workflow waits before sending an alert—no notification for a 1-2 minute outage, only real, persistent problems.\n\n---\n\n### How to Test & Use\n\n1. **Activate the workflow.**  \n   Toggle it on in n8n and it’ll check your sites automatically.\n2. **Test instantly:**  \n   Add a non-existent URL and run the workflow. After the wait time, you’ll get an email alert for that URL.\n3. **Notifications stay organized:**  \n   Alerts go straight to your inbox (see my [AI email labelling template](https://youtu.be/BQARyWMD_lU) if you want color-coded organization).\n\n---\n\n### Get Critical Alerts on Your Phone (Telegram)\n\nEmail is great, but for your most important sites you want instant notifications on your phone.  \n**Best option:** Use Telegram. n8n can send you messages via a Telegram bot—easy to set up, free, and works in seconds.\n\n**How:**\n- Create a Telegram bot via BotFather (instructions in the template).\n- Add your bot token and chat ID to n8n.\n- Now, you’ll get downtime alerts right on Telegram—no missed notifications, no extra costs.\n\n---\n\n### FAQ\n\n- **Can I monitor unlimited sites?**  \n  Yes, just list them all in the config.\n- **What if downtime is just a few seconds?**  \n  The default 5-minute wait filters these out.\n- **Do I need a paid n8n plan?**  \n  No - self-hosting is free, and the workflow works on free plans.\n- **Why not SMS or WhatsApp?**  \n  Telegram bots are fastest, easiest, and don’t require extra API setup or subscriptions.\n",
