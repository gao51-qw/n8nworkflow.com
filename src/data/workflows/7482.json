Configure the following connections:  \n   - **OpenAI** (for Book Brief, Book Writer, Designer, and Content Writer Agents).  \n   - **AWS S3** (for image storage).  \n   - **Google Drive** (for document storage & archiving).  \n3. Add your API keys and credentials in **n8n credentials manager**.  \n4. Test the workflow by sending a sample chat message (e.g., *“Write a book about AI in education”*).  \n5. Verify outputs in Google Drive (HTML + PDF) and AWS S3 (cover image).  \n\n## **Requirements**\n- **n8n** (latest version with **AI Tool Node** support).  \n- **OpenAI API key** (to power multi-agent models).  \n- **AWS account** (with S3 bucket for storing images).  \n- **Google Drive integration** (for document storage and archiving).  \n- Basic familiarity with **workflow setup in n8n**.  \n\n## **How to customize the workflow**\n- **Switch Models**: Replace `gpt-4.1-mini` with other models (faster, cheaper, or more powerful).  \n- **Add More Agents**: Introduce agents for **editing, fact-checking, or translation**.  \n- **Change Output Format**: Export to **EPUB, DOCX, or Markdown** instead of PDF.  \n- **Branding Options**: Modify the **cover generation prompt** to include company logos or specific style.  \n- **Extend Storage**: Add **Dropbox, OneDrive, or Notion** integration for additional archiving.  \n- **Trigger Alternatives**: Replace chat trigger with **form submission, webhook, or schedule-based runs**.  \n\n✅ This workflow acts as a **free, plug-and-play template** to showcase how **multi-agents + AI Tool Node** can work together to automate complex content creation pipelines.
