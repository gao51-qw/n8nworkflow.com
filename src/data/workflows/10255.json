  "title": "Transcribe & summarize GoHighLevel call recordings",
  "description": "This n8n template automatically transcribes GoHighLevel (GHL) call recordings and creates an AI-generated summary that is added as a note directly to the related contact in your GHL CRM.\n\nIt’s designed for real estate investors, agencies, and sales teams that handle a large volume of client calls and want to keep detailed, searchable notes without spending hours on manual transcription.\n\n---\n\n## Who’s it for\n* Sales and acquisitions teams that want instant call notes in their CRM  \n* Real estate wholesalers or agencies using GoHighLevel for deal flow  \n* Support and QA teams that need summarized transcripts for review  \n* Any business owner who wants to automatically document client conversations  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n1. A **HighLevel automation workflow** triggers when a call is marked “Completed” and automatically sends a webhook to n8n.   \n2. The n8n workflow receives this webhook and waits briefly to ensure the call recording is ready.    \n3. It retrieves the **conversation and message IDs** from the webhook payload.  \n4. The call recording is fetched from GHL’s API.  \n5. An **AI transcription node** converts the audio to text.  \n6. A **summarization node** condenses the transcript into bullet points or a concise paragraph.  \n7. A **Code node** formats the AI output into proper JSON for GHL’s “Create Note” endpoint.  \n8. Finally, an **HTTP Request node** posts the summary to the contact’s record in GHL.  \n\n---\n\n## How to set up\n1. Add your **GoHighLevel OAuth credential** and connect your agency account.  \n2. Add your **AI credential** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini).  \n3. Replace the sample webhook URL with your n8n endpoint.   \n5. Test with a recent call and confirm the summary appears in the contact timeline.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n* GoHighLevel account with API and OAuth access    \n* AI service for transcription and summarization (e.g., OpenAI Whisper + GPT)  \n\n---\n\n## Customizing this workflow\nYou can tailor this automation for your specific team or workflow:  \n* Add sentiment analysis or keyword extraction to the summary.  \n* Change the AI prompt to focus on “action items,” “objections,” or “next steps.”  \n* Send summaries to Slack, Notion, or Google Sheets for reporting.  \n* Trigger follow-up tasks automatically in your CRM based on keywords.  \n\n---\n\n**Good to know**\n* AI transcription and summarization costs vary by provider — check your LLM’s pricing.  \n* GoHighLevel’s recording availability may take up to 1 minute after the call ends; adjust the delay accordingly.  \n* For OAuth setup help, refer to GHL’s [OAuth documentation](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/Authorization/OAuth2.0/index.html).  \n\n---\n\nHappy automating! ⚙️\n",
