  "description": "## How it works  \nThis workflow runs on a daily schedule to analyze all active HubSpot deals and their latest engagement activity. It applies AI-driven behavioral scoring to predict conversion probability and deal health. High-risk or stalled deals automatically trigger Slack alerts. All insights are logged in Google Sheets for forecasting and performance tracking.\n\n## Step-by-step  \n\n- **Step 1 – Trigger and collect active deals**  \n  - **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at a fixed time each day.  \n  - **Get Active Deals from HubSpot** – Retrieves all non-closed deals with key properties like value, stage, and activity dates.  \n  - **Formatting Data** – Cleans and normalizes deal data while calculating metrics such as deal age and inactivity duration.  \n\n- **Step 2 – Enrich deals with engagement data**  \n  - **If** – Filters only active deals to ensure closed deals are excluded.  \n  - **Loop Over Items** – Processes each deal individually to handle enrichment safely.  \n  - **HTTP Request** – Fetches engagement associations linked to each deal.  \n  - **Get an engagement** – Retrieves detailed engagement records from HubSpot.  \n  - **Extracts Data** – Structures engagement content, timestamps, and internal notes for AI analysis.  \n\n- **Step 3 – Analyze risk and notify the team**  \n  - **AI Agent** – Analyzes behavioral signals and predicts conversion probability, risk level, and next actions.  \n  - **Format Data** – Parses the AI output into structured fields and risk indicators.  \n  - **Filter Alerts Needed** – Identifies deals that require immediate attention.  \n  - **Send Slack Alert** – Sends a detailed alert with risks, signals, and recommended actions.  \n  - **Append or update row in sheet** – Stores analysis results in Google Sheets for tracking and forecasting.  \n\n## Why use this?  \n\n- Detect deal risk early using consistent, AI-based analysis  \n- Reduce manual pipeline reviews for sales managers  \n- Provide clear, actionable next steps to sales reps  \n- Keep a historical log of deal health and forecasts  \n- Improve close rates through timely, data-driven intervention  \n",
