I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), a Supply Chain Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).\n\nWe design tools to help companies improve their **logistics processes** using data analytics, AI, and automation—to **reduce costs and minimize environmental impacts**.\n\n&gt;Let’s use N8N to improve logistics operations!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis workflow template is designed for **logistics or manufacturing operations** that receive orders by email.\n\n[![Example of emails](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-17.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8dO_30SB0) \n\nThe example above illustrate the challenge we want to tackle using an **AI Agent** to parse the information and load them in a **Google sheet**.\n\nIf you want to understand how I built this workflow, check my detailed tutorial:\n\n[![Tutorial Screenshot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/Miniature-2.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8dO_30SB0)\n\n  \n[🎥 Step-by-Step Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8dO_30SB0)\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThe workflow is connected to a **Gmail Trigger** to open all the emails that include *Inbound Order* in their subject.\n\nThe email is parsed by an **AI Agent** equipped with **OpenAI's GPT** to collect all the information.\n\nThe results are pulled in a **Google Sheet**.\n\n[![Final Results](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-18.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8dO_30SB0)\n\nThese orderlines can then be **transferred to warehouse teams** to prepare ***order receiving**.\n\n### What do I need to get started?\n\nYou’ll need:\n- **Gmail and Google Drive Accounts** with the API credentials to access it via n8n\n- An **OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o) for the chat model.\n- A **Google Sheet** with these columns: **PO_NUMBER, EXPECTED_DELIVERY DATE, SKU_ID, QUANTITY**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nFollow the sticky notes in the workflow to configure each node and start using **AI to support your logistic operations**.\n\n🚀 Curious how N8N can transform your logistics operations?  \n📬 Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Notes\n\n- An example of email is included in the template so you can try it with your mailbox.\n\n*This workflow was built using N8N version 1.82.1*  \n*Submitted: March 28, 2025*\n",
