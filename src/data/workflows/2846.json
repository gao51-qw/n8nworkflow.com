  "description": "The \"Voice RAG Chatbot with ElevenLabs and OpenAI\" workflow in n8n is designed to create an interactive voice-based chatbot system that leverages both text and voice inputs for providing information. Ideal for shops, commercial activities and restaurants\n\n### How it works:\n\nHere's how it operates:\n\n1. **Webhook Activation**: The process begins when a user interacts with the voice agent set up on [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu), triggering a webhook in n8n. This webhook sends a question from the user to the AI Agent node.\n2. **AI Agent Processing**: Upon receiving the query, the AI Agent node processes the input using predefined prompts and tools. It extracts relevant information from the knowledge base stored within the Qdrant vector database.\n3. **Knowledge Base Retrieval**: The Vector Store Tool node interfaces with the Qdrant Vector Store to retrieve pertinent documents or data segments matching the user’s query.\n4. **Text Generation**: Using the retrieved information, the OpenAI Chat Model generates a coherent response tailored to the user’s question.\n5. **Response Delivery**: The generated response is sent back through another webhook to ElevenLabs, where it is converted into speech and delivered audibly to the user.\n6. **Continuous Interaction**: For ongoing conversations, the Window Buffer Memory ensures context retention by maintaining a history of interactions, enhancing the conversational flow.\n\n### Set up steps:\n\nTo configure this workflow effectively, follow these detailed setup instructions:\n\n1. **ElevenLabs Agent Creation**:\n\t- Create a FREE account on [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu)\n   - Begin by creating an agent on ElevenLabs (e.g., named 'test_n8n').\n   - Customize the first message and define the system prompt specific to your use case, such as portraying a character like a waiter at \"Pizzeria da Michele\".\n   - Add a Webhook tool labeled 'test_chatbot_elevenlabs' configured to receive questions via POST requests.\n\n2. **Qdrant Collection Initialization**:\n   - Utilize the HTTP Request nodes ('Create collection' and 'Refresh collection') to initialize and clear existing collections in Qdrant. Ensure you update placeholders `QDRANTURL` and `COLLECTION` accordingly.\n\n3. **Document Vectorization**:\n   - Use Google Drive integration to fetch documents from a designated folder. These documents are then downloaded and processed for embedding.\n   - Employ the Embeddings OpenAI node to generate embeddings for the downloaded files before storing them into Qdrant via the Qdrant Vector Store node.\n\n4. **AI Agent Configuration**:\n   - Define the system prompt for the AI Agent node which guides its behavior and responses based on the nature of queries expected (e.g., product details, troubleshooting tips).\n   - Link necessary models and tools including OpenAI language models and memory buffers to enhance interaction quality.\n\n5. **Testing Workflow**:\n   - Execute test runs of the entire workflow by clicking 'Test workflow' in n8n alongside initiating tests on the ElevenLabs side to confirm all components interact seamlessly.\n   - Monitor logs and outputs closely during testing phases to ensure accurate data flow between systems.\n\n6. **Integration with Website**:\n   - Finally, integrate the chatbot widget onto your business website replacing placeholder AGENT_ID with the actual identifier created earlier on ElevenLabs.\n\nBy adhering to these comprehensive guidelines, users can successfully deploy a sophisticated voice-driven chatbot capable of delivering precise answers utilizing advanced retrieval-augmented generation techniques powered by OpenAI and ElevenLabs technologies.\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
