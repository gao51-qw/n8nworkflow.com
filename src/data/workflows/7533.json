  "description": "### Workflow Overview\nThis workflow automates the process of creating and publishing engaging Facebook posts that teach Chinese words to a Thai-speaking audience. It integrates multiple AI models, APIs, and tools to generate content, create visuals, and publish posts seamlessly. Below is a detailed breakdown of the workflow:\n\n### Who Is This Template For?\n- Social Media Managers: Teams managing Facebook pages and looking for automated, engaging content creation.\n- Content Creators: Professionals who want to streamline the process of generating educational and visually appealing posts.\n- Language Enthusiasts: Individuals or organizations teaching languages (e.g., Chinese) to a Thai-speaking audience.\n\n### What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nCreating engaging social media content manually can be time-consuming and inconsistent. This workflow solves that by:\n- Automating the generation of educational posts in Thai with Chinese vocabulary.\n- Creating visually appealing images tailored to the post's theme.\n- Publishing posts directly to Facebook using the Pages API.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n1. **Input Handling**\nThe workflow starts with an input word (e.g., received via chat or fetched from a Google Sheet).\nThe input is split into two variables (word and input) to ensure data persistence throughout the workflow.\n2. **Generate Text Content**\nAn AI model (OpenRouter Chat Model) generates a structured Facebook post in Thai, including:\n- Engaging hook\n- Core vocabulary (Chinese word, Pinyin, and Thai meaning)\n- Real-world usage examples\n- Pro-tip or fun fact\n- Call-to-action for engagement\n- Relevant hashtags\n3. **Describe Image Concept**\nAnother AI model creates a brief description of the visual theme for the post. This description is used as input for generating an image.\n4. **Generate Image**\nThe workflow uses Recraft.ai to generate an image based on the description. The image is styled consistently using predefined themes (e.g., digital illustration).\n5. **Publish Post**\nThe generated text and image are published to Facebook using the Pages API. The post includes:\nThe educational content as the caption.\nThe generated image as the visual element.\n\n## Setup Guide\n### Pre-Requisites\nAccess to the following APIs: \n- OpenRouter.ai: For generating text content and image descriptions.\n- Recraft.ai: For generating images.\n- Facebook Graph API: For publishing posts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup\n1. Configure Input Source: Replace the chat input node with your preferred source (e.g., Google Sheet, email, or manual input).\nSet Up OpenRouter.ai:\n2. Configure the credentials for OpenRouter.ai in the respective nodes (OpenRouter Chat Model and OpenRouter Chat Model1).\n3. Set Up Recraft.ai:\nAdd your API key for Recraft.ai in the Generate Image (Recraft.ai) node.\n4. Configure Facebook Graph API:\nSet up the Facebook Graph API credentials with the required permissions (pages_manage_posts, pages_read_engagement, etc.).\n5. Update the page_id and graphApiVersion in the Facebook Graph API node.\n6. Test the Workflow:\nRun the workflow manually to verify that it generates content, creates images, publishes posts, and logs details correctly.\n\n### How to Customize This Workflow to Your Needs\n- Change Input Source: Replace the chat input with a Google Sheet, email, or database query.\n- Modify Content Style: Adjust the AI prompts to suit your audience (e.g., professional tone, casual language).\n- Use Different Image Styles: Experiment with other styles/themes in Recraft.ai for the generated images.\n- Expand Use Cases: Adapt the workflow to other social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn) by modifying the API calls.\n\n#### Why Use This Template?\n- Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks like content creation and image generation.\nConsistency: Ensures posts follow a consistent format and style.\n- Engagement: Creates visually appealing and interactive content to boost audience engagement.\n- Scalability: Easily adaptable for different topics, languages, or platforms.\nAdditional Resources\n",
