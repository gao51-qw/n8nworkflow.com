  "description": "What is this?\nThis is an n8n workflow designed to supercharge your Sonarr setup. Instead of just waiting for releases to appear in your RSS feed, this workflow proactively runs on a schedule, finds what's missing, actively searches for it, and grabs the best result based on your specific criteria.\n\nIt's a \"set it and forget it\" solution to ensure your library is always complete.\n\nKey Features\n🚀 Proactive Searching: Doesn't wait for content to come to you. It actively triggers a search for missing episodes.\n\n🗓️ Fully Automated & Scheduled: Runs every 12 hours by default to check for anything new that's missing.\n\n🧠 Smart & Efficient: Searches only once per season, even if multiple episodes from that season are missing, preventing unnecessary API calls.\n\n🎯 Precise Release Filtering: It validates search results against the exact quality name and language you define before telling Sonarr to grab it. This gives you more control than standard quality profiles.\n\n✅ Automatic Download: Once a valid release is found, it's automatically pushed to your download client via Sonarr.\n\nHow It Works\nTrigger: The workflow starts automatically on a schedule.\n\nFetch Missing: It connects to your Sonarr instance and gets a list of all monitored, \"wanted\" episodes.\n\nFilter & Group: It intelligently creates a unique list of seasons that need searching.\n\nSearch: It loops through each unique season and tells Sonarr to perform an interactive search.\n\nValidate: It inspects the search results and only allows releases that match both the pre-defined quality AND language.\n\nGrab: If a perfect match is found, it sends a final command to Sonarr to grab that specific release and begin the download.\n\nHow to Use This Template\nImport the JSON file into your n8n instance.\n\nFind the node named \"info\" (it's a \"Set\" node near the beginning). This is your main configuration area.\n\nUpdate the following values in the \"info\" node:\n\nurlSonar: Change http://192.168.31.204:8989 to your Sonarr's URL.\n\napikey: Paste your Sonarr API key here.\n\nquality: Set the exact quality name you want to match (e.g., WEBDL-1080p).\n\nlanguages: Set the exact language name you want to match (e.g., English, Spanish).\n\nActivate the workflow. That's it!\n\nYou can also change the schedule by editing the \"Schedule Trigger\" node.",
