  "description": "## Workflow Description\n\nThis workflow helps content creators automatically repurpose YouTube videos into SEO-friendly blog posts. It extracts the video transcript, uses AI to generate a full blog post with a relevant image, and sends the complete package via email, ready for publication.\n\n## Prerequisites/Requirements\n\nThis workflow relies on external AI services. You will need:\n\n1.  **OpenAI Account:** Used for generating the blog post text (specifically mentioned using GPT-4o in the workflow notes).\n    * **Credentials:** Requires an API key from OpenAI.\n    * **Cost:** OpenAI API usage is typically paid based on the amount of text processed (tokens). Check OpenAI's current pricing.\n    * **Setup:** Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and obtain your API key.\n2.  **Dumpling AI Account:** Used for retrieving YouTube video transcript and generating the blog post image.\n    * **Credentials:** Requires an API key from Dumpling AI.\n    * **Cost:** Dumpling AI offers 250 free credits to start with and different plans for different levels of usage. Check the [pricing page](https://www.dumplingai.com/pricing) for more details.\n    * **Setup:** Sign up at [Dumpling AI](https://www.dumplingai.com) and obtain your API key/credentials.\n3.  **Email Account:** Credentials for the email service (e.g., Gmail) used to send the final result.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1.  **Input Video Details:** You provide the YouTube video URL and your email address.\n2.  **Get Transcript:** The workflow fetches the transcript of the specified YouTube video.\n3.  **Generate Content:** An AI model crafts a blog post (title, description, body) based on the transcript.\n4.  **Create Image:** Another AI model generates a suitable image for the blog post.\n5.  **Format & Package:** The blog post is converted to HTML, and the image is prepared for sending.\n6.  **Email Result:** The final HTML blog post and image are emailed to you.\n\n***\n\n![Screenshot 20250413 at 3.27.15 pm.png](fileId:1108)\n\n***\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1.  **Configure Variables:** Enter the specific YouTube video URL and the recipient email address in the \"Set Variables\" node.\n2.  **Connect Credentials:** Add your credentials for the services used (e.g., OpenAI for text generation, Dumpling AI for YouTube Transcript and AI image generation service).\n3.  **Connect Email Credentials:** Authenticate your Gmail account (or chosen email provider) to allow the workflow to send the email.\n\n## Take it to the next level\n\n* **Direct Publishing:** Instead of emailing the result, connect directly to your CMS (like WordPress, Ghost, Webflow) to automatically create a draft or publish the blog post.\n* **AI Agent Integration:** Replace the single \"Generate Blog Post\" step with an AI Agent for more sophisticated content generation, potentially researching topics or structuring the post section by section based on the transcript.\n* **Social Media Snippets:** Add steps to generate companion social media posts (e.g., for Twitter, LinkedIn) summarizing the blog post.\n* **Batch Processing:** Modify the trigger to read multiple YouTube URLs from a spreadsheet or database to convert videos in bulk.\n* **Enhanced SEO:** Refine the AI prompts to specifically target keywords or incorporate SEO best practices more deeply into the generated content.\n* **Multiple Image Options:** Generate several image variations and include them in the email or draft post for selection.\n",
