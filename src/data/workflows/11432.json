If you want to make the most of your free time between appointments and discover great nearby spots without manual searching, this template is for you.\nWhat it does\nThis workflow automatically monitors your Google Calendar and identifies gaps between appointments. When it detects sufficient free time (configurable, default 30+ minutes), it calculates travel time to your next destination, checks the weather, and uses AI to recommend the top 3 spots to visit during your break.
