  "description": "## This workflow automates news aggregation and summarization by fetching relevant articles from Gnews.io and using AI to create concise, professional summaries delivered via Slack\n\n### **What Makes This Different:**\n- **Real-Time News Aggregation** - Fetches current news articles from Gnews.io API based on user-specified topics\n- **AI-Powered Summarization** - Uses GPT-4.1 to intelligently select and summarize the most relevant articles\n- **Professional Formatting** - Generates clean, readable summaries with proper dates and article links\n- **Form-Based Input** - Simple web form interface for topic specification\n- **Automated Delivery** - Sends summarized news directly to Slack for immediate consumption\n- **Intelligent Filtering** - AI selects the top 15 most relevant articles from search results\n\n### **Key Benefits of Automated News Summarization:**\n- **Time Efficiency** - Transforms hours of news reading into minutes of focused summaries\n- **Comprehensive Coverage** - AI ensures all important financial and business developments are captured\n- **Professional Quality** - Generates publication-ready summaries with proper formatting\n- **Real-Time Updates** - Always delivers the latest news on any topic\n- **Centralized Access** - All news summaries delivered to one Slack channel\n- **Customizable Topics** - Search for news on any subject matter\n\n---\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis template is designed for **business professionals, financial analysts, content creators, journalists, and anyone who needs to stay updated on specific topics** without spending hours reading through multiple news sources. It's perfect for professionals who want to stay informed about industry developments, market trends, or any specific subject matter while maintaining productivity.\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow creates an **automated news summarization system** that transforms topic searches into professional news summaries. The system:\n\n1. **Receives topic input** through a simple web form interface\n2. **Fetches news articles** from Gnews.io API based on the specified topic\n3. **Maps article data** to prepare for AI processing\n4. **Uses AI to select** the 15 most relevant articles related to financial advancements, tools, research, and applications\n5. **Generates professional summaries** with clear, readable language and proper formatting\n6. **Includes article links** and current date for complete context\n7. **Delivers summaries** via Slack notification for immediate review\n\n**Key Innovation: Intelligent News Curation** - Unlike basic news aggregators, this system uses AI to intelligently filter and summarize only the most relevant articles, saving time while ensuring comprehensive coverage of important developments.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1. Configure Form Trigger\n- Set up n8n form trigger with \"topic\" field (required)\n- Configure form title as \"News Search\"\n- Test form submission functionality\n- Ensure proper data flow to subsequent nodes\n\n### 2. Configure Gnews.io API\n- **Get your API key**: Sign up at [gnews.io](https://gnews.io) and obtain your API key from the dashboard\n- **Add API key to workflow**: In the \"Get GNews articles\" HTTP Request node, replace `\"ADD YOUR API HERE\"` with your actual Gnews.io API key\n- **Example configuration**:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"q\": \"{{ $json.topic }}\",\n    \"lang\": \"en\",\n    \"apikey\": \"your-actual-api-key-here\"\n  }\n  ```\n- **Configure search parameters**: Ensure language is set to \"en\" for English articles\n- **Test API connectivity**: Run a test execution to verify news articles are returned correctly\n\n### 3. Configure OpenAI API\n- Set up OpenAI API credentials in n8n\n- Ensure proper API access and quota limits\n- Configure the GPT-4.1 Model node for AI summarization\n- Test AI model connectivity and response quality\n\n### 4. Configure Slack Integration\n- Set up Slack API credentials in n8n\n- Configure Slack channel ID for news delivery\n- Set up proper message formatting for news summaries\n- Test Slack notification delivery\n\n### 5. Test the Complete Workflow\n- Submit test form with sample topic (e.g., \"artificial intelligence\")\n- Verify Gnews.io returns relevant articles\n- Check that AI generates appropriate news summaries\n- Confirm Slack notification contains formatted news summary\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **n8n instance** with form trigger and HTTP request capabilities\n- **OpenAI API** access for AI-powered news summarization\n- **Gnews.io API** credentials for news article fetching\n- **Slack workspace** with API access for news delivery\n- **Active internet connection** for real-time API interactions\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify News Search Parameters\n- Adjust the number of articles to summarize (currently set to 15)\n- Add more search depth options or date ranges\n- Implement language filtering for different regions\n- Add news source filtering or preferences\n\n### Enhance AI Capabilities\n- Customize AI prompts for specific industries or niches\n- Add support for multiple languages\n- Implement different summary styles (brief, detailed, bullet points)\n- Add content quality scoring and relevance filtering\n\n### Expand News Sources\n- Integrate with additional news APIs (NewsAPI, Bing News, etc.)\n- Add support for RSS feed integration\n- Implement trending topic detection\n- Add competitor news monitoring\n\n### Improve News Delivery\n- Add email notifications alongside Slack\n- Implement news scheduling capabilities\n- Add news approval workflows\n- Implement news performance tracking\n\n### Business Features\n- Add news analytics and engagement metrics\n- Implement A/B testing for different summary formats\n- Add news calendar integration\n- Implement team collaboration features for news sharing\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Real-time news aggregation** -
