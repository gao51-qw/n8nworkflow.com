Add HubSpot trigger credential (be careful, scopes must be exactly as in [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot/) )\n2. Add your Exact Buyer API key\n3. Add HubSpot credential for update node (be careful, scopes must be same as [n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/hubspot/) for this.
