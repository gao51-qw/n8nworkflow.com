  "description": "# 🤖 MCP Personal Assistant Workflow Description\n\nThis workflow integrates multiple productivity tools into a single AI-powered assistant using n8n, acting as a centralized control hub to receive and execute tasks across Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more. \n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Capabilities\n\n- **AI Agent + Tool Use**: Built using n8n's AI Agent and MCP system, enabling intelligent multi-step reasoning.\n- **Tool Integration**:\n  - Google Calendar: schedule, update, delete events\n  - Gmail: search, draft, send emails\n  - Google Drive: manage files and folders\n  - LinkedIn & Twitter: post updates, send DMs\n  - Utility tools: fetch date/time, search URLs\n- **Discord Input**: Accepts prompts via `n8n_discord_trigger_bot` [repo link](https://github.com/Jharilela/n8n_discord_trigger_bot)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Timezone Configuration**:\n   - Go to `Settings &gt; Default Timezone` in n8n.\n   - Set to your local timezone (e.g., `Asia/Jakarta`).\n   - Ensure all `Date & Time` nodes explicitly use the same zone to avoid UTC-related bugs.\n\n2. **Tool Authentication**:\n   - Replace all OAuth credentials for:\n     - Gmail\n     - Google Drive\n     - Google Calendar\n     - Twitter\n     - LinkedIn\n   - Use your own accounts when copying this workflow.\n\n3. **Platform Adaptability**:\n   - While designed for Discord, you can replace the Discord trigger with any other chat or webhook service.\n   - Example: Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp Webhook, n8n Form Trigger, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Strengths\n\n- Great for **document retrieval**, **email summarization**, **calendar scheduling**, and **social posting**.\n- Reduces the need for tab-switching across multiple platforms.\n- Tested with a comprehensive checklist across categories like:\n  - Calendar\n  - Gmail\n  - Google Drive\n  - Twitter\n  - LinkedIn\n  - Utility tools\n  - Cross-tool actions  \n  (Refer to [discordGPT prompt checklist](https://n8n.io/workflows/XXXXXX) for prompt coverage.)\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Limitations\n\n- ❌ **Binary Uploads**:\n  - AI agents & MCP server currently struggle with binary payloads.\n  - Uploading files to Gmail, Google Drive, or LinkedIn may fail due to format serialization issues.\n  - Binary operations (upload/post) are **under development** and will be fixed in future iterations.\n\n- ❌ **Date Bugs**:\n  - If timezone settings are incorrect, event times may default to UTC, leading to misaligned calendar events.\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 Testing\n\nUse the provided prompt checklist for full coverage of:\n- ✅ Core feature flows\n- ✅ Edge cases (e.g., invalid dates, nonexistent users)\n- ✅ Cross-tool chains (e.g., Google Drive → Gmail → LinkedIn)\n\n---\n\n## ✅ MCP Assistant Test Prompt Checklist\n\n### 📅 Google Calendar\n- [X] \"Schedule a meeting with Alice tomorrow at 10am. and send an invite to alice@wonderland.com\"\n- [X] \"Create an event called 'Project Sync' on Friday at 3pm with Bob and Charlie.\"\n- [X] \"Update the time of my call with James to next Monday at 2pm.\"\n- [X] \"Delete my meeting with Marketing next Wednesday.\"\n- [x] \"What is my schedule tommorow ? \"\n\n### 📧 Gmail\n- [x] \"Show me unread emails from this week.\"\n- [x] \"Search for emails with subject: invoice\"\n- [X] \"Reply to the latest email from john@company.com saying 'Thanks, noted!'\"\n- [X] \"Draft an email to info@a16z.com with subject 'Emp0 Fundraising' and draft the body of the email with an investment opportunity in Emp0, scrape this site https://Emp0.com to get to know more about emp0.com\"\n- [X] \"Send an email to hi@cursor.com with subject 'Feature request' and cc sales@cursor.com\"\n- [ ] \"Send an email to recruiting@openai.com , write about how you like their product and want to apply for a job there and attach my latest CV from Google Drivce\"\n\n### 🗂 Google Drive\n- [ ] \"Upload the PDF you just sent me to my Google Drive.\"\n- [X] \"Create a folder called 'July Reports' inside Emp0 shared drive.\"\n- [X] \"Move the file named 'Q2_Review.pdf' to 'Reports/2024/Q2'.\"\n- [X] \"Share the folder 'Investor Decks' with info@a16z.com as viewer.\"\n- [ ] \"Download the file 'Wayne_Li_CV.pdf' and attach it in Discord.\"\n- [X] \"Search for a file named 'Invoice May' in my Google Drive.\"\n\n### 🖼 LinkedIn\n- [X] \"Think of a random and inspiring quote.
