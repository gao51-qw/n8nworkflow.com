  "description": "**Who is this for?**\nThis template is ideal for **n8n administrators, automation engineers, and DevOps teams** who want to maintain bidirectional synchronization between their n8n workflows and GitHub repositories. It helps teams keep their workflow backups up-to-date and ensures consistency between their n8n instance and version control system.\n\n**What problem is this workflow solving?**\nManaging workflow versions across n8n and GitHub can become complex when changes happen in both places. This workflow solves that by **automatically synchronizing workflows bidirectionally**, ensuring that the most recent version is always available in both systems without manual intervention or version conflicts.\n\n**What this workflow does:**\n\n* Runs on a **weekly schedule** (every Monday) to check for synchronization needs.\n* Fetches all workflows from your n8n instance and compares them with GitHub repository files.\n* Identifies workflows that exist **only in n8n** and uploads them to GitHub as JSON backups.\n* Identifies workflows that exist **only in GitHub** and creates them in your n8n instance.\n* For workflows that exist in both places, compares timestamps and **syncs the most recent version**:\n\n  * If n8n version is newer → Updates GitHub with the latest workflow\n  * If GitHub version is newer → Updates n8n with the latest workflow\n* Automatically handles file naming, encoding/decoding, and commit messages with timestamps.\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1. **Connect GitHub**: Configure GitHub API credentials in the GitHub nodes.\n   *Note: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) with `repo` permissions to read and write workflow files.*\n2. **Connect n8n API**: Provide your n8n API credentials in the `n8n` nodes. [Check this doc](https://docs.n8n.io/api/authentication/)\n3. **Configure GitHub Details** in the **Set GitHub Details** node:\n\n   * `github_account_name`: Your GitHub username or organization\n   * `github_repo_name`: The repository name where workflows should be stored\n   * `repo_workflows_path`: The folder path in your repo (e.g., `workflows` or `n8n-workflows`)\n4. **Adjust Schedule**: Modify the Schedule Trigger if you want a different sync frequency (currently set to weekly on Mondays).\n5. **Test the workflow**: Run it manually first to ensure all connections and permissions are working correctly.\n\n**How to customize this workflow to your needs:**\n\n* **Change sync frequency**: Modify the Schedule Trigger to run daily, hourly, or on-demand.\n* **Add filtering**: Extend the Filter node to exclude certain workflows (e.g., test workflows, templates).\n* **Add notifications**: Insert Slack, email, or webhook notifications to report sync results.\n* **Implement conflict resolution**: Add custom logic for handling workflows with the same timestamp.\n* **Add workflow validation**: Include checks to validate workflow JSON before syncing.\n* **Branch management**: Modify to sync to different branches or create pull requests instead of direct commits.\n* **Backup retention**: Add logic to maintain multiple versions or archive old workflows.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Bidirectional sync**: Handles changes from both n8n and GitHub\n* **Timestamp-based conflict resolution**: Always keeps the most recent version\n* **Automatic file naming**: Converts workflow names to valid filenames\n* **Base64 encoding/decoding**: Properly handles JSON workflow data\n* **Comprehensive comparison**: Uses dataset comparison to identify differences\n* **Automated commits**: Includes timestamps in commit messages for traceability\n\nThis automated synchronization workflow provides a robust backup and version control solution for n8n workflows, ensuring your automation assets are always safely stored and consistently available across environments.\n",
