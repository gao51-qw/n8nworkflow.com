This tool allows end users to request Certificate Signing Requests that are automatically approved or passed to the Secops team for manual approval depending on the Virustotal analysis of the requested domain. Not only does this help centralize requests, but it helps an organization maintain the security certifications by allowing automated processes to log and analyze requests in real time. \n\n**Workflow Highlights:**\n- **Interactive Modals**: Utilizes Slack modals to gather user inputs for scan configurations and report generation, providing a user-friendly interface for complex operations.\n- **Dynamic Workflow Execution**: Integrates seamlessly with Venafi to execute CSR generation and if any issues are found, AI can generate a custom report that is then passed to a slack teams channel for manual approval with the press of a single button.\n\n**Operational Flow:**\n- **Parse Webhook Data**: Captures and parses incoming data from Slack to understand user commands accurately.\n- **Execute Actions**: Depending on the user's selection, the workflow triggers other actions within the flow like automatic Virustotal Scanning.\n- **Respond to Slack**: Ensures that every interaction is acknowledged, maintaining a smooth user experience by managing modal popups and sending appropriate responses.\n\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n- Verify that Slack and Qualys API integrations are correctly configured for seamless interaction.\n- Customize the modal interfaces to align with your organization's operational protocols and security policies.\n- Test the workflow to ensure that it responds accurately to Slack commands and that the integration with Qualys is functioning as expected.\n\n\n**Need Assistance?**\n- Explore Venafi's [Documentation](https://docs.venafi.com/) or get help from the [n8n Community](https://community.n8n.io) for more detailed guidance on setup and customization.\n\nDeploy this bot within your Slack environment to significantly enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of your security operations, enabling proactive management of CSR's.",
