  "description": "\n\nThis workflow enables users to submit food images to a Telegram bot, which uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 Vision to identify the item and estimate its caloric value. The results are stored in Google Sheets and sent back to the user.\n\n### What it does:\n1. Triggers on a photo sent via Telegram.\n2. Acknowledges the user with a sticky note message.\n3. Downloads the image file securely using Telegram's API.\n4. Sends the image to GPT-4 Vision with a prompt: *“Describe this food and estimate its calories.”*\n5. Logs the GPT response to a Google Sheet (with timestamp).\n6. Replies to the user with the result (e.g., food name and estimated calories).\n\n### Use cases:\n- Personal food tracking\n- Nutrition logging via chat\n- Meal journaling for fitness or health\n\n### Requirements:\n- Telegram Bot Token (via credentials)\n- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision access\n- Google Sheets credential with access to the target sheet\n\n### Notes:\n- You can extend this template to calculate daily totals, categorize meals (breakfast/lunch/dinner), or even integrate with calorie goals.\n- The sticky note node confirms receipt to enhance UX.\n- Ideal for wellness apps, chat-based food journals, or AI-powered health bots.\n",
