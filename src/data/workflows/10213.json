  "title": "Automate email discovery for companies with Anymail Finder, Google Sheets & Telegram alerts",
  "description": "This automation **retrieves company information** from a Google Sheet, uses the Anymail Finder API to **discover email addresses associated with each company**, and then writes the results (including the email status) back into the same Google Sheet and send alert on **Telegram**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Advantages**\n\n* **✅ Automated Email Discovery:** No need for manual lookups—emails are found via the Anymail Finder API in bulk.\n* **🔁 Seamless Google Sheets Integration:** Works directly with Google Sheets for input and output, allowing easy data management.\n* **🧠 Smart Filtering:** Automatically classifies emails as valid, risky, or not found for quality control.\n* **⚙️ Reusable & Scalable:** Can be run anytime with a manual trigger or expanded to handle thousands of records with minimal setup.\n* **📊 Real-Time Updates:** Results are immediately reflected in your spreadsheet, streamlining lead generation and outreach workflows.\n* **💸 Cost-Efficient:** Uses a free Anymail Finder trial or API key for testing and validation before scaling up.\n\n---\n\n### **How it Works**\n\nThis automated workflow finds email addresses for a list of companies using the Anymail Finder API and updates a Google Sheets document with the results.\n\n1.  **Trigger & Data Retrieval:** The workflow starts manually. It first connects to a specified Google Sheet and retrieves a list of company leads that are marked for processing (where the \"PROCESSING\" column is empty).\n2.  **Batch Processing & API Call:** The list of leads is then split into batches (typically one item at a time) to be processed individually. For each company, the workflow sends the \"Company Name\" and \"Website\" to the Anymail Finder API to search for a relevant email address.\n3.  **Result Classification:** The API's response, which includes the found email and its status (e.g., `valid`, `risky`), is passed to a Switch node. This node routes the data down different paths based on the email status.\n4.  **Sheet Update:** Depending on the status:\n    *   **Valid/Risky Email:** The workflow updates the original Google Sheet row. It marks the \"PROCESSING\" column with an \"x\" and writes the found email address into the \"EMAIL\" column.\n    *   **No Email Found:** The workflow also updates the sheet, marking \"PROCESSING\" with an \"x\" and leaving the \"EMAIL\" column empty to indicate no email was found.\n5.  **Loop Completion:** After processing each item, the workflow loops back to process the next lead in the batch until all companies have been handled.\n---\n\n\n### **Set up Steps**\n\nTo use this workflow, you need to complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  **Duplicate the Template Sheet:** Clone the provided Google Sheets template to your own Google Drive. This sheet contains the necessary columns (\"COMPANY NAME\", \"WEBSITE\", \"EMAIL\", \"PROCESSING\") for the workflow to function.\n\n2.  **Get an API Key:** Sign up for a free trial at Anymail Finder to obtain your personal API key.\n\n3.  **Configure Credentials in n8n:**\n    *   **Google Sheets:** In both the \"Get Leads\" and update nodes, set up the Google Sheets OAuth2 credential to grant n8n access to your copied spreadsheet.\n    *   **Anymail Finder:** In the \"Email finder\" HTTP Request node, create a new credential of type \"HTTP Header Auth\". Name it \"Anymail Finder\". In the \"Name\" field, enter `Authorization`. In the \"Value\" field, paste your Anymail Finder API key.\n\n4.  **Update Sheet ID in Nodes:** In the n8n workflow, update all Google Sheets nodes (\"Get Leads\", \"Email found\", \"Email not found\") with the Document ID of your *cloned* Google Sheet. The Sheet ID can be found in your sheet's URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE]/edit...`.\n\n5.  **Execute:** Once configured, add your list of companies and their websites to the sheet and run the workflow using the \"Manual Trigger\" node.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).",
