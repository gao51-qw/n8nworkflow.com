  "description": "# Companies Email Finder & Lead Generation Automation\n\n## Short Description\nAutomatically find company domains, extract decision maker emails (CEO, Sales, Marketing), validate email quality, and build a comprehensive prospect database using AI-powered search and professional email finding APIs.\n\n## Detailed Description\n\nThis comprehensive lead generation workflow transforms a simple list of company names into a complete prospect database with verified decision maker contacts. The system automatically discovers official company websites, finds key decision makers' email addresses, validates email quality, and organizes everything in a structured database for immediate outreach.\n\nPerfect for sales teams, marketing agencies, business developers, and anyone who needs to build high-quality prospect lists efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\n## Key Features\n\n-

for:\n  - CEOs and C-level executives\n  - Sales decision makers\n  - Marketing decision makers\n- **Email Quality Validation**: Classifies emails as \"valid\" or \"risky\" for better deliverability\n- **Smart Fallback System**: Searches for additional company emails when decision makers aren't found\n- **Duplicate Prevention**: Removes duplicate contacts automatically\n- **Batch Processing**: Handles large company lists efficiently with intelligent batching\n- **Database Integration**: Stores all data in NocoDB with proper organization and status tracking\n- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays and error handling to respect API limits\n\n## Who This Workflow Is For\n\n- **Sales Teams**: Building targeted prospect lists for outbound campaigns\n- **Marketing

Deliverability Issues**: Validates email quality before outreach campaigns\n- **Data Organization**: Maintains clean, structured prospect databases\n- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Processes hundreds of companies automatically\n- **High Lead Generation Costs**: Reduces dependency on expensive lead generation services\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n### Required API Credentials\n-
