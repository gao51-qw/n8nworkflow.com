  "description": "### How It Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow is a comprehensive, two-AI-agent system that acts as a virtual research and content team. It automates the entire process of turning a single topic into an actionable content strategy.\n\n1.  **AI Agent 1 (The Researcher)**: The workflow starts with a manual trigger where you input a research topic. An **HTTP Request** node then acts as the first agent, performing a web search (e.g., using a Google Search API) to gather the most relevant articles and data.\n2.  **Data Aggregation**: The raw data from the web search is then consolidated into a single, clean text block using a **Function** node. This makes the information digestible for the second AI agent.\n3.  **AI Agent 2 (The Strategist)**: A second **OpenAI** node takes the aggregated data and acts as the strategist. It analyzes the content and uses a sophisticated prompt to generate a list of 5 specific and actionable content ideas.\n4.  **Distribution & Notification**: The generated ideas are then automatically sent to two separate destinations. Each idea is logged into a **Google Sheets** database, which serves as your content calendar. A **Slack** notification is also sent to your marketing team, immediately alerting them to the new ideas.\n\n### How to Set Up 🛠️\n\n1.  **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n2.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    * **Google Search**: Add your API Key.\n    * **OpenAI**: Add your API Key.\n    * **Google Sheets**: Add your OAuth2 credential.\n    * **Slack**: Add your Bot Token credential.\n3.  **Customize Workflow Nodes**:\n    * **Node 1 (`Manual Trigger`)**: You will input your research topic here to start the workflow.\n    * **Node 7 (`Google Sheets`)**: Replace `[YOUR SPREADSHEET ID]` and `[YOUR SHEET NAME]` with your own content calendar details.\n    * **Node 8 (`Slack`)**: Replace `[YOUR SLACK CHANNEL ID]` with the channel where your team receives marketing updates.\n4.  **Save & Activate**: Once all settings and credentials are configured, save the workflow and click the \"Inactive\" toggle in the top-right corner to make it live.",
