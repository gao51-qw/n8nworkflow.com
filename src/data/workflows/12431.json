  "description": "## Who’s it for\nProperty management companies, building managers, and inspection teams who want to automate recurring property inspections, improve issue tracking, and streamline reporting.\n\n## How it works / What it does\nThis n8n workflow schedules periodic property inspections using a Cron trigger. AI generates customized inspection checklists for each property, which are sent to assigned inspectors. Inspectors submit photos and notes via a connected form or mobile app. AI analyzes these submissions to flag issues based on priority (high, medium, low). High-priority issues are routed to managers via Slack/email, while routine notes are logged for reporting. The workflow also generates weekly or monthly summary reports and can optionally notify tenants of resolved issues.\n\n## How to set up\n- Configure the Cron trigger with your desired inspection frequency.\n- Connect Google Sheets or your CRM to fetch property and tenant data.\n- Set up OpenAI node with your API key and checklist generation prompts.\n- Configure email/SMS notifications for inspectors.\n- Connect a form or mobile app via Webhook to collect inspection data.\n- Set up Slack/email notifications for managers.\n- Log all inspection results, photos, and flagged issues into Google Sheets.\n- Configure summary report email recipients.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n account with Google Sheets, Email, Slack, Webhook, and OpenAI nodes.\n- Property and tenant data stored in Google Sheets or CRM.\n- OpenAI API credentials for AI checklist generation and note analysis.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- Adjust Cron frequency to match inspection schedule.\n- Customize AI prompts for property-specific checklist items.\n- Add or remove branches for issue severity (high/medium/low).\n- Include additional notification channels if needed (Teams, SMS, etc.).\n\n## Workflow Use Case\nAutomates property inspections for property management teams, ensuring no inspections are missed, AI-generated checklists standardize the process, and potential issues are flagged and routed efficiently. Saves time, improves compliance, and increases tenant satisfaction.\n\n**Created by QuarterSmart | Hyrum Hurst**\n",
