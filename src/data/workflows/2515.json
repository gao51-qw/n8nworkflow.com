It uses IMAP to read the emails from your email account (i.e. Gmail). \n2. It then passes the email to Openrouter.ai and uses a free A.I. model to read and summarize the email. \n3. It then sends the summary as a message to your messenger (i.e. Line).\n\n## Setup\n1. You need to find your email server IMAP credentials. \n2. Input your openrouter.ai API credentials or replace the HTTP request node with an A.I. node such as OpenAI. \n3. Input your messenger credentials. I use Line but you can change the node to another messenger line Telegram.\n4. You need to change the message ID to your ID inside the http request. You can find your user ID inside the https://developers.line.biz/console/. Change the \"to\": {insert your user ID}.\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- You can change the A.I. prompt to fit your needs by telling it to mark emails from a certain address as important. \n- You can change the A.I. model from the current meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free to a paid model or other free models. \n- You can change the messenger node to telegram or any other messenger app you like.\n\n",
