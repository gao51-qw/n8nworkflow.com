  "description": "**Description**\nThis n8n workflow enables users to send an image to a Telegram bot and receive the extracted text using Tesseract OCR (via the n8n-nodes-tesseractjs Community Node). It's a quick and straightforward way to convert images into readable text directly through chat.\n\n**How it Works**\n\n- The workflow listens for new image messages coming in via the Telegram bot.\n\n- Once an image is received, it downloads the image file from Telegram (which initially arrives as application/octet-stream).\n\n- The image data, now properly identified, is then sent to the Tesseract OCR node to extract the text.\n\n- Finally, the recognized text is sent back as a reply to the Telegram user.\n\n**Setup Steps**\n\n- Install Community Node: Ensure you have installed n8n-nodes-tesseractjs in your n8n instance.\n\n- Connect Telegram Bot: Configure the Telegram Trigger node with your Telegram bot.\n\n- Bot Token: Add your Telegram bot token to the Send Message node to send replies.\n\n- Deploy & Test: Activate (deploy) the workflow and send an image to your Telegram bot to test.",
