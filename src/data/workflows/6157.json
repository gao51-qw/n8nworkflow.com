It integrates various data sources and channels for comprehensive yet efficient news consumption. Ideal use-cases include:\n\n- Monitoring breakthroughs in research fields\n- Receiving daily business opportunity updates (e.g., real estate)\n- Lower the cognitive load required to follow your favorite news\n- Translating news summaries to your chosen language\n\n## 🔍 What this workflow does\n\nThe workflow gathers news from RSS feeds, search engines, and social media, then:\n\n- Filters duplicates and irrelevant content via custom regex filters and date ranges.\n- Applies optional AI-powered Quality Assurance for headline evaluation.\n- Selects top news articles with AI analysis focused on user-defined criteria and audience.\n- Summarizes individual articles using AI summarization agents, ensuring structured, consistent outputs.\n- Optionally translates and adjusts the tone of summaries.\n- Distributes summaries through configured channels such as email, social media, messaging apps, or webhook calls.\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Steps\n\n### 1. News Gathering\n\n- Fetch news using RSS feeds, SerpAPI search, and optionally video channel feeds.\n- Standardize output structures for seamless merging.\n- Employ sub-workflows for video transcript retrieval and looping over custom RSS feed lists.\n\n### 2. Filtering\n\n- Remove duplicates and news outside the specified date range.\n- Exclude articles matching user-defined keywords via regex filters in URLs, titles, and content.\n- Limit the number of news articles for AI analysis.\n\n### 3. News Selection\n\n- Optionally invoke an AI Quality Assurance agent to pre-filter headlines.\n- Aggregate news for AI analysis.\n- Select and summarize top news articles with AI agents using customizable criteria.\n- Parse AI responses into defined JSON structures to ensure consistent data.\n\n### 4. News Summarization\n\n- Prepare individual article content.\n- Summarize content with AI agents and validate structured output.\n\n### 5. Sender Preparation\n\n- Combine general summaries with selected top news summaries.\n- Format final summaries as text and HTML suitable for delivery.\n- Optionally apply translation and tone adjustment.\n\n### 6. Sending\n\n- Deliver summaries through selected channels (Email, Telegram, WhatsApp, Webhook).\n- Optionally save the output to disk as JSON.\n\n## 📌 Expected Input / Configuration\n\nThe workflow is primarily configured via the **Configure Workflow Args** node or the **Global Variables** custom node, with these key parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description | Type |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| `search_themes` | List of keywords/themes to search in SerpAPI | List of strings |\n| `datetime_delta` | Number of days back to include news from; e.g., 0 = today | Integer |\n| `link_censor` | Regex to exclude unwanted URLs | Regex string |\n| `title_censor` | Regex to exclude unwanted titles | Regex string |\n| `content_censor` | Regex to exclude unwanted content | Regex string |\n| `use_qa` | Flag to enable AI Quality Assurance for headline filtering | Boolean |\n| `max_news_analysis` | Max number of articles sent to News Analyzer | Integer |\n| `qa_max_news` | Number of headlines the QA Agent analyzes | Integer |\n| `qa_max_top_news` | Number of headlines selected by QA Agent | Integer |\n| `qa_check_criteria` | Criteria used by QA Agent to discard low-quality headlines | List of strings |\n| `qa_select_criteria` | Criteria used by QA Agent to rank/select the best headlines | List of strings |\n| `news_focus` | What the News Analyzer should focus on while selecting news | String |\n| `news_target_audience` | Target audience description for the News Analyzer | String |\n| `news_criteria` | Instructions for the News Analyzer to identify relevant news | List of strings |\n| `language` | Language for news summaries; triggers translation if not English | String |\n| `translator_tone` | Tone for translation (e.g., casual, professional) | String |\n| `translator_notes` | Additional instructions for the translator | String |\n| `email_sender` | Email address used for sending (via SMTP) | String |\n| `email_recipients` | Recipient email addresses (comma-separated) | String |\n| `email_subject` | Email subject line | String |\n| `telegram_chat_id` | Telegram chat ID for sending notifications | String |\n| `phone_number` | Phone number for WhatsApp messages | String |\n| `rss_feeds` | Custom list of RSS feeds (objects with `link` and `needs_content_search` properties) | JSON array of objects |\n| `video_rss_feeds` | Custom list of video RSS feeds | JSON array of objects |\n| `enable_video_search` | Enable/disable video search functionality | Boolean |\n| `enabled_senders` | List of enabled delivery channels (email, telegram, whatsapp, webhook, save-to-disk) | List of strings |\n\n*Hint:* To add or combine keywords in censors, use the pattern `\"keyword1|keyword2|keyword3\"`.\n\n## 📦 Expected Output\n\nStructured JSON containing a general news summary, top news with summaries, and metadata, suitable for your preferred channel delivery.\n\n## 📌 Example\n\n![example.png](fileId:1798)\n\nAn example that includes workflow parameters is provided in a note within the workflow.\n\n## ⚙️ n8n Setup Used\n\n- **n8n version:** 1.100.1\n- **n8n-nodes-serpapi:** 0.1.6\n- **n8n-nodes-globals:** 1.1.0\n- **LLM Model:** mistral-small-latest (API)\n- **IMAP:** imap.gmail.com (Port 993)\n- **Platform:** Podman 4.3.1 on Linux\n- **Date:** 2025-07-15\n\n## ⚡ Requirements to Use / Setup\n\n- Self-hosted n8n instance.\n(This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.)\n- Install necessary custom nodes:\n    - [n8n-nodes-serpapi](https://github.com/serpapi/n8n-nodes-serpapi)\n    - [n8n-nodes-globals](https://github.com/umanamente/n8n-nodes-globals#readme) (or use Edit Field (Set) node instead)\n- Configure all sub-workflows bundled within this template (see [Sub-Workflows Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/subworkflows/)).\n- Provide valid credentials to nodes for SerpAPI, Telegram, WhatsApp, Mistral Cloud Chat API, and SMTP (for email).\n- Custom RSS feed list must be set by you in the workflow args.\n- You must either install the SerpAPI custom node or deactivate it.\n\n## ⚠️ Notes, Assumptions \\& Warnings\n\n- The workflow timeout is set to 30 minutes by default; adjust depending on your setup and workload.\n- Duplicate removal is applied, but occasional overlaps might still appear depending on feed sources.\n- This workflow assumes familiarity with n8n, RSS feeds, API key management and regex expressions.\n- Video search only works for configured video channels; remember to respect the rights of these channels.\n- Using AI agents (Mistral or substitute LLMs) requires access to their API services and keys.\n- Out-of-the-box customization is done via the Global Variables node or direct workflow argument edits.\n\n## ℹ️ About Us\n\nThis workflow was developed by the Hybroht team of AI enthusiasts and developers dedicated to enhancing the capabilities of AI through collaborative processes.
