  "description": "🤖📞 This workflow automates the process of calling customers to **remind them of their booking reservations** using AI-generated messages and a **Twilio** phone number. It can easily be adapted for other venues.\n\n\n---\n\n###  **Key Benefits**\n\n* **Time-Saving Automation**: Eliminates the need for manual calls by staff, saving hours per week.\n* **Human-like AI Messages**: Uses a custom language model to generate polite, natural phone messages tailored to each customer.\n* **Multi-Channel Integration**:\n\n  * Google Sheets for reservation tracking.\n  * Twilio for automated calling.\n  * OpenRouter (or other LLMs) for generating speech content.\n* **Error Reduction**: Ensures all customers receive reminders exactly on the reservation day, minimizing no-shows.\n* **Scalable**: Easily adapts to growing reservation lists and more complex message logic.\n* **Suitable** for restaurants, hairdressers, offices and any other business\n\n---  \n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Trigger**:  \n   - The workflow can be triggered **manually** (via *\"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’*) or **automatically** at 11 AM daily (via *Schedule Trigger*).  \n2. **Data Fetch**:  \n   - Retrieves today’s reservations from a **Google Sheet**, filtering rows where `DATE = today` and `CALLED` is empty.  \n3. **AI-Generated Call Script**:  \n   - For each reservation, the *Secretary Agent* (powered by **OpenRouter’s Grok-4**) generates a **phone script** using the guest’s name, time, and party size.  \n4. **Twilio Call**:  \n   - The script is sent to **Twilio**, which calls the guest’s phone number (from the sheet) and reads the message aloud using text-to-speech.  \n5. **Update & Loop**:  \n   - Marks the reservation as called (`CALLED = \"x\"`) in the sheet and waits **2 minutes** between calls to avoid rate limits.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Twilio Configuration**:  \n   - Sign up for Twilio, buy a phone number, and:  \n     - Enable **text-to-speech** (set language to Italian).  \n     - Configure **geo permissions** for the target country.  \n     - Add credentials to the *Twilio node* (sender number in `From` field).  \n2. **Google Sheets Setup**:  \n   - Clone the Google Sheet template and ensure:  \n     - Phone numbers include the **international prefix (without \"+\")**.  \n     - Columns: `DATE`, `TIME`, `NAME`, `N. PEOPLE`, `PHONE`, `CALLED`.  \n3. **OpenRouter API**:  \n   - Connect the *OpenRouter Chat Model* node to your account (using Grok-4 or another model).  \n4. **Deploy**:  \n   - Activate the workflow and test with manual execution.  \n\n**Note**: The workflow is currently **inactive** (`active: false`). Enable it after setup.  \n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n\n",
