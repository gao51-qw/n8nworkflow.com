  "description": "## 📄 What this workflow does\n Every 3 hours, the workflow fetches 3 random English words, asks Gemini to generate a short Vietnamese vocabulary digest (word, Vietnamese meaning, and an example sentence), and sends it to a Telegram chat. Perfect for steady, low-effort vocab exposure in groups.\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n- English learners who want a gentle, automated learning cadence.\n- Teachers/tutors who share daily vocab in Telegram groups.\n- Community admins who want lightweight, useful content for members.\n- Anyone who prefers bite-sized language learning on autopilot.\n\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n- Gemini API access (configured in n8n).\n- Telegram Bot token + chat ID (the chat you want to receive messages).\n- Internet access to Random Word API (no API key required).\n- n8n instance with outbound HTTPS access.\n\n\n## ⚙️ How to set up\n1. Add your Gemini credentials in n8n (the Google Gemini/PaLM node).\n2. Add your Telegram credentials and set the chatId in the “Send a text message” node.\n3. (Optional) Adjust the schedule interval (default: every 3 hours).\n4. (Optional) Change the number of words by updating the HTTP Request URL param words=3.\n5. (Optional) Edit the Gemini prompt language/content to fit your style (currently Vietnamese output).\n6. Run once to test; confirm the message arrives in Telegram.\n\n## 🔁 How it works\n1. Schedule Trigger → runs every 3 hours.\n2. HTTP Request → calls random-word-api to get 3 words.\n3. Edit Fields (Set) → wraps the API response under word.\n4. Aggregate → prepares the word field for the LLM.\n5. Message a model (Gemini) → creates a Vietnamese digest: English word, Vietnamese meaning, and example sentence for each word.\n6. Send a text message (Telegram) → posts the digest to your specified chat.\n\n## 💡 About Margin AI\n[Margin AI](https://marginai.co/) is an AI-services agency that acts as your AI Service Companion.
