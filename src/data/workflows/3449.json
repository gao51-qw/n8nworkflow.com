You must use the production webhook URL for the event subscription.\n\n**Some sample queries to try**\n* \"What's included in the product team's sprint demo this week?\"\n* \"Who's booked room 7 for this Thursday?\"\n* \"When is Jim & Nik's sales meeting with Microsoft?\"\n\n### Requirements\n* Slack for Chat and Trigger.\n  * To get connected to Slack, see the [official n8n docs for Slack Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/).\n* Outlook for Agent Tools\n  * To get connected to Outlook, see the [official n8n docs for Outlook Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/imap/outlook/).\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Not using Slack? This template can be modified to work with Teams but requires a little more configuration.\n* Agents can have any number of tools but an overloaded agent is prone to confusion! If this happens, try splitting into multiple agents serving separate needs.",
