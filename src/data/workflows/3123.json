  "description": "This n8n template extends the idea of follow-up reminders by having an AI agent suggest and book the next call or message to re-engage prospects which have been ignored.\n\nWhat makes this template particularly interesting and actually usable is that it uses the Human-in-the-loop approach to wait for a user's approval before actually making the booking or otherwise not if the user declined.\n\nA twist on a traditional idea where we can reduce the number of actionable tasks a human has to make by delegating them to AI.\n\n## How it works\n* A scheduled trigger checks your google calendar for sales meetings which happened a few days ago.\n* For each event, gmail search is used to figure out if a follow-up message has been sent or received from the other party since the meeting. If none, it might mean the user needs a reminder to follow-up.\n* For leads applicable for follow-up, we first get an AI Agent to find available meeting slots in the calendar.\n* These slots and reminder are sent to the user via send-and-approval mode of the gmail node. The user replies in natural language either picking a slot, suggesting an entirely new slot or declines the request.\n* When accepted, another AI Agent books the meeting in the calendar with the proposed dates and lead.\n* When declined, no action is taken.\n\n## How to use\n* Update all calendar nodes (+subnodes) to point to the right calendar. If this is a shared-purpose calendar, you may need to either filter or create a new calendar.\n* Update the gmail nodes to point to the right accounts.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google OAuth for Email and Calendar\n* OpenAI for LLM\n\n## Customising the template\n* Not using Google? Swap out for Microsoft Outlook/Calendar or something else.\n* Try swapping out or adding in additional send-for-approval methods such as telegram or whatsapp.",
