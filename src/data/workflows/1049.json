This information gets passed on to the next node in the workflow.\n\n**Set node:** We will use the Set node to ensure that only the data that we set in this node gets passed on to the next nodes in the workflow.\n\n**Google BigQuery:** This node will send the data from the previous node to the `position` table in Google BigQuery. If you have created a table with a different name, use that table instead.",
