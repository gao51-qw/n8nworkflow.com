It's ideal for prioritizing leads and understanding how well a person fits your ICP criteria.\n\n## What This Automation Does\nGiven a LinkedIn profile and an Airtop profile, it:\n- Extracts relevant data from the person's profile\n- Determines levels of AI interest, seniority, and technical depth\n- Calculates an ICP score based on weighted criteria\n- Returns the full enriched profile with the score\n\n## Input parameters:\n- **LinkedIn Profile URL** (e.g., `https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe`)\n- **Airtop Profile** connected to LinkedIn\n- **ICP scoring method** in the Airtop node prompt\n\n## Output fields in JSON format:\n- Full name, job title, employer, company LinkedIn URL, location, number of connections and followers, about section content and more\n- Calculated ICP Score (out of 100)\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Form Trigger or Workflow Trigger**: Accepts input from either a form or another workflow.\n2. **Parameter Assignment**: Ensures proper variable names for downstream nodes.\n3. **Airtop Enrichment Tool**: Extracts and scores the person based on a detailed prompt.\n4. **Scoring**: Uses this point system:\n   - AI Interest: beginner (5), intermediate (10), advanced (25), expert (35)\n   - Technical Depth: basic (5), intermediate (15), advanced (25), expert (35)\n   - Seniority Level: junior (5), mid-level (15), senior (25), executive (30)\n5. **Output Formatting**: Cleans and returns the result as JSON.\n\n## Setup Requirements\n1. IMPORTANT: Enter your ICP scoring method in the prompt field of the Airtop node \n2. [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) connected to LinkedIn.\n3. Airtop API credentials configured in n8n.\n4.
