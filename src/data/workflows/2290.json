The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Notion Page Added Trigger**:\n   - Monitors a specified Notion database for newly added pages. You can create a specific Notion database where you copy the pages you want to store in Supabase.\n   - Node: `Page Added in Notion Database`\n\n2. **Retrieve Page Content**:\n   - Fetches all block content from the newly added Notion page.\n   - Node: `Get Blocks Content`\n\n3. **Filter Non-Text Content**:\n   - Excludes blocks of type \"image\" and \"video\" to focus on textual content.\n   - Node: `Filter - Exclude Media Content`\n\n4. **Summarize Content**:\n   - Concatenates the Notion blocks content to create a single text for embedding.\n   - Node: `Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content`\n\n5. **Store in Supabase**:\n   - Stores the processed documents and their embeddings into a Supabase table with a vector column.\n   - Node: `Store Documents in Supabase`\n\n6. **Generate Embeddings**:\n   - Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate embeddings for the textual content.\n   - Node: `Generate Text Embeddings`\n\n\n7. **Create Metadata and Load Content**:\n   - Loads the block content and creates associated metadata, such as page ID and block ID.\n   - Node: `Load Block Content & Create Metadata`\n\n8. **Split Content into Chunks**:\n   - Divides the text into smaller chunks for easier processing and embedding generation.\n   - Node: `Token Splitter`",
