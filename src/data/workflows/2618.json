  "description": "This n8n template shows how anyone can build a simple newsletter-like subscription service where users can enrol themselves to receive messages/content on a regular basis. It uses n8n forms for data capture, Airtable for database, AI for content generation and Gmail for email sending.\n\n### How it works\n* An n8n form is setup up to allow users to subscribe with a desired topic and interval of which to recieve messages via n8n forms which is then added to the Airtable.\n* A scheduled trigger is executed every morning and searches for subscribers to send messages for based on their desired intervals.\n* Once found, Subscribers are sent to a subworkflow which performs the text content generation via an AI agent and also uses a vision model to generate an image.\n* Both are attached to an email which is sent to the subscriber. This email also includes an unsubscribe link.\n* The unsubscribe flow works similarly via n8n form interface which when submitted disables further scheduled emails to the user.\n\n## How to use\n* Make a copy of sample Airtable here: [https://airtable.com/appL3dptT6ZTSzY9v/shrLukHafy5bwDRfD](https://airtable.com/appL3dptT6ZTSzY9v/shrLukHafy5bwDRfD)\n* Make sure the workflow is \"activated\" and the forms are available and reachable by your audience.\n\n## Requirements\n* Airtable for Database\n* OpenAI for LLM (but compatible with others)\n* Gmail for Email (but can be replaced with others)\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* This simple use can be extended to deliver any types of content such as your company newsletter, promotions, social media posts etc.\n* Doesn't have to be limited to just email - try social messaging, Whatsapp, Telegram and others.",
