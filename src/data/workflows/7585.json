  "description": "## Automatically Rename Gmail Attachments with AI and Save to Google Drive\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is perfect for anyone who regularly receives important email attachments like reports, invoices, or PDFs and wants them:\n\n- Renamed using clean AI generated filenames  \n- Automatically saved to a specific Google Drive folder  \n- Neatly organized without manual work  \n\nIt is ideal for freelancers, business owners, accountants, and productivity enthusiasts.\n\n### What does it solve?\n\nManually naming and organizing email attachments takes time and often leads to messy files.\n\nThis workflow solves that by:\n\n- Automatically downloading unread Gmail attachments  \n- Using AI to understand the content and generate clean, consistent filenames  \n- Saving the renamed files to your chosen Google Drive folder  \n- Marking emails as read after processing  \n\nNo more confusing filenames like \"Attachment 1.pdf\".\n\n### How it works\n\n1. The workflow runs on a scheduled interval (every hour by default)  \n2. It checks Gmail for any unread emails with attachments.  \n3. For each email:\n   - Downloads attachments  \n   - Extracts and reads PDF content  \n   - Uses AI to generate a new filename in the format: `YYYYMMDD-keyword-summary.pdf`  \n4. Saves the file to Google Drive with the new name  \n5. Marks the email as read to avoid duplicates  \n\n### How to set up?\n\n1. Connect these accounts in your n8n credentials:\n   - Gmail (OAuth2)  \n   - Google Drive (OAuth2)  \n   - OpenAI (API key)  \n\n2. Update the folder URL in the Google Drive node to your target folder  \n3. Optional: adjust the trigger interval if you want it to run more or less often  \n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Change the AI prompt to create different naming rules, such as including sender or topic  \n- Dynamically set Drive folders based on email sender or subject  \n",
