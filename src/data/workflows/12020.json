  "description": "# Automated Podcast Generation with n8n, OpenAI & Buzzsprout\n\nThis workflow automatically turns any audio file uploaded to Google Drive into a complete podcast episode. It handles transcription, content generation, blog drafting, social copy creation, thumbnail generation, Airtable record updates, Buzzsprout publishing and finally notifies your team via Slack.\nIt is a full “audio-to-published-podcast” automation that requires no manual editing.\n\n### ⚡ Quick Start: 10-Step Fast Implementation\n\n1. Connect Google Drive, OpenAI, Airtable, Slack & Buzzsprout credentials.\n2. Upload an audio file to the Drive folder.\n3. Workflow triggers automatically.\n4. Audio → Text transcription via OpenAI Whisper.\n5. AI converts transcript into title, show notes, tags, publish date, etc.\n6. AI generates social content & blog article.\n7. AI generates YouTube thumbnail (URL saved).\n8. Data saved to Airtable.\n9. Episode uploaded to Buzzsprout.\n10. Slack receives final “Episode Published” notification.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow automates the complete lifecycle of podcast publishing. Once an audio file is placed inside a Google Drive folder, the system takes over: it transcribes the audio, generates structured metadata, creates rich content including a blog post and multiple social media captions and produces a YouTube-ready thumbnail.\n\nGenerated content is saved into Airtable, ensuring you always have a centralized database of episode metadata. The workflow then uploads the processed audio file to Buzzsprout, creating a ready-to-publish podcast entry. Finally, it sends a Slack notification summarizing the episode details.\n\nThis workflow eliminates hours of manual podcast editing, writing and uploading — providing a fast, reliable and repeatable content automation pipeline.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\n* Podcasters who want to automate production and publishing\n* Marketing teams managing multiple content channels\n* Creators who want to repurpose audio into blogs & social content\n* Agencies or studios producing podcasts for clients\n* Anyone wanting a hands-free “record → upload → publish” podcast system\n\n\n## Airtable Table Structure (Required Fields)\n\nTo run this workflow successfully, you must create **one Airtable table** that stores all generated podcast episode data.\n\nBelow is the **exact list of fields** (with correct Airtable field types) that the workflow expects.\n\n| Field Name                 | Airtable Field Type | Purpose                                                   |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **episode_title**          | Single line text    | Title generated from the audio transcript                 |\n| **record_Id**              | Auto number         | Automatically generated unique internal record identifier |\n| **episode_description**    | Long text           | Description of the episode (AI-generated)                 |\n| **show_notes**             | Long text           | Detailed show notes generated from transcript             |\n| **suggested_publish_date** | Single line text    | Publish date suggested by AI                              |\n| **blog_draft_markdown**    | Long text           | SEO-optimized full blog draft                             |\n| **linkedin_post**          | Long text           | LinkedIn long-form post                                   |\n| **instagram_caption**      | Long text           | Instagram caption + hashtags                              |\n| **twitter_thread**         | Long text           | Thread text (converted from array → single string)        |\n| **tiktok_script**          | Long text           | Short TikTok/Shorts script                                |\n| **youtube_thumbnail_url**  | URL                 | Thumbnail image URL generated by OpenAI                   |\n| **buzzsprout_episode_id**  | Number              | Episode ID returned from Buzzsprout                       |\n| **audio_url**              | Single line text    | Buzzsprout final audio file URL                           |\n| **published_at**           | Single line text    | Actual published datetime returned by Buzzsprout          |\n| **guid**                   | Single line text    | Unique GUID assigned by Buzzsprout                        |\n\n### Notes for Users Setting Up the Table\n\n* Do **not** use array fields — arrays are converted into strings before saving.\n* `record_Id` is Airtable auto-number will generate it and it used for update record.\n* `published_at`, `audio_url`, `guid` and `buzzsprout_episode_id` are populated **after Buzzsprout upload**.\n* `youtube_thumbnail_url` is populated after the AI Image Generation node.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use this workflow, you need:\n\n* **n8n** self-hosted or cloud\n* **Google Drive account** (folder monitored for new audio uploads)\n* **OpenAI API Key** (Whisper + GPT + Image Generation)\n* **Airtable Base & API Key**\n* **Buzzsprout Podcast ID & API Token**\n* **Slack App / Bot Token**\n* Audio file in **MP3/WAV/M4A** format\n\n\n## How It Works & Setup Steps\n\n### Step 1 — Google Drive Trigger\n\n* Monitors a specific folder.\n* When an audio file is uploaded, the workflow starts.\n\n### Step 2 — Transcribe Audio with OpenAI\n\n* Uses Whisper model to convert speech → text.\n* Returned transcript is cleaned and extracted.\n\n### Step 3 — Extract Episode Metadata\n\n* Title\n* Description\n* Show notes\n* Episode tags\n* Suggested publish date\n* All parsed and structured via OpenAI.\n\n### Step 4 — Generate Social Media Content\n\n* LinkedIn article post\n* Twitter/X thread\n* Instagram caption\n* TikTok short script\n\n### Step 5 — Generate Blog Draft\n\n* Full SEO-optimized Markdown article created by OpenAI.\n\n### Step 6 — Create YouTube Thumbnail\n\n* OpenAI Image API\n* 1280×720 thumbnail\n* URL stored in Airtable.\n\n### Step 7 — Save Everything to Airtable\n\n* One single table\n* Stores episode title, description, tags, blog draft, social content, thumbnail URL, and transcript.\n\n### Step 8 — Upload Episode to Buzzsprout\n\n* Audio file from Google Drive → uploaded via multipart/form-data\n* Title & description set\n* Response returns audio URL and episode ID\n* These are stored in Airtable.\n\n### Step 9 — Slack Notification\n\nSends message containing:\n\n* Episode Title\n* Buzzsprout Episode ID\n* Published At Date\n* Thumbnail URL\n\n\n## How to Customize Nodes\n\n### Google Drive Trigger\n\nChange the folder ID to monitor a different source directory.\n\n### OpenAI Metadata Prompt\n\nAdjust tone, style, summarization level or tag generation.\n\n### Social Content Node\n\nModify the prompt to produce longer posts, more thread tweets or add new channels.\n\n### Image Generation\n\nCustomize thumbnail style: minimal, realistic, bold text, brand colors, etc.\n\n### Buzzsprout Upload Node\n\nSet `episode[published_at]` to schedule future releases.\n\n### Slack Notification\n\nAdd more fields such as show notes or Airtable record links.\n\n\n## Add-Ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\nYou may extend the workflow with:\n\n* **Auto-post to LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok** via Buffer API\n* **Notion page creation** for drafting content\n* **Automatic transcript** upload to Google Docs\n* **Email notification** to hosts or guests\n* **Auto-publish** YouTube video version (using static background + audio)\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n1. **Podcast Production Automation** – Record audio, upload to Drive and get a fully published episode automatically.\n2. **Content Repurposing Workflow** – Turn one audio file into several content formats instantly.\n3. **Marketing Team Efficiency** – Auto-generate social posts for multiple platforms.\n4. **Client Podcast Management** – Agencies can manage episodes with zero manual work.\n5. **Internal Communications** – Convert internal voice memos into polished summaries and blogs.\n\n(There can be many more such use cases depending on customization.)\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue
