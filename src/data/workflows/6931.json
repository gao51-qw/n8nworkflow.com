  "description": "Overview\n\nThis n8n workflow, named \"Keyword Search for Blogs,\" automates the process of gathering and organizing keyword research data for SEO purposes. It integrates with Google Sheets and Google Drive to manage input and output data, and leverages the DataForSEO API to fetch comprehensive keyword-related information, including related keywords, keyword suggestions, keyword ideas, autocomplete suggestions, subtopics, and SERP (Search Engine Results Page) analysis. The workflow is designed to streamline SEO research by collecting, processing, and storing data in an organized manner for blog content creation.\n\nWorkflow Functionality\n\nThe workflow performs the following key functions:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger: Initiated manually via the \"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\" node, allowing users to start the process on-demand.\n\n\n\nInput Data Retrieval: Reads primary keywords, location, and language data from a specified Google Sheet (\"SEO PRO\").\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet Creation: Creates a new Google Sheet with a dynamic title based on the current date (e.g., \"YYYY-MM-DD-seo pro\") and predefined sheet names for organizing different types of keyword data (e.g., keyword, SERP, Content, related keyword, keyword ideas, suggested keyword, subtopics, autocomplete).\n\n\n\nGoogle Drive Integration: Moves the newly created spreadsheet to a designated folder (\"seo pro\") in Google Drive for organized storage.\n\n\n\nAPI Data Collection:\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Keywords: Fetches related keywords using the DataForSEO API (/v3/dataforseo_labs/google/related_keywords/live), including SERP information and keyword metrics like search volume, CPC, and competition.\n\n\n\nKeyword Suggestions: Retrieves keyword suggestions via the DataForSEO API (/v3/dataforseo_labs/google/keyword_suggestions/live).\n\n\n\nKeyword Ideas: Collects keyword ideas using the DataForSEO API (/v3/dataforseo_labs/google/keyword_ideas/live).\n\n\n\nAutocomplete Suggestions: Gathers Google autocomplete suggestions through the DataForSEO API (/v3/serp/google/autocomplete/live/advanced).\n\n\n\nSubtopics: Generates subtopics for the primary keyword using the DataForSEO API (/v3/content_generation/generate_sub_topics/live).\n\n\n\nPeople Also Ask & Organic Results: Pulls \"People Also Ask\" questions and organic SERP results via the DataForSEO API (/v3/serp/google/organic/live/advanced).\n\n\n\nData Processing:\n\n\n\n\n\nUses Split Out nodes to break down API responses into individual items for processing.\n\n\n\nEmploys Edit Fields nodes to map and format data, extracting relevant fields like keyword, search intent, search volume, CPC, competition, keyword difficulty, and SERP item types.\n\n\n\nFilters SERP results to separate \"People Also Ask\" and organic results for targeted processing.\n\n\n\nData Storage: Appends processed data to multiple sheets in the destination Google Sheet (\"2025-06-08-seo pro\") across different tabs:\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Sheet: Stores comprehensive data including keywords, search intent, related keywords, SERP analysis, and more.\n\n\n\nRelated Keywords: Stores related keyword data with metrics.\n\n\n\nSuggested Keywords: Stores suggested keyword data.\n\n\n\nKeyword Ideas: Stores keyword ideas with relevant metrics.\n\n\n\nAutocomplete: Stores autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\n\nSubtopics: Stores generated subtopics.\n\n\n\nOrganic Results: Stores organic SERP data with details like domain, URL, title, and description.\n\nKey Features\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation: Eliminates manual keyword research by automating data collection and organization.\n\n\n\nScalability: Processes multiple keywords and their related data in a single workflow run, with a limit of 100 related items per API call.\n\n\n\nDynamic Organization: Creates and organizes data in a new Google Sheet with a timestamped title, ensuring easy tracking of research over time.\n\n\n\nComprehensive SEO Insights: Collects diverse SEO metrics (e.g., keyword difficulty, search intent, SERP item types) to inform content strategy.\n\n\n\nError Handling: Uses filters to ensure only relevant data (e.g., \"people_also_ask\" or \"organic\" results) is processed and stored.\n\nUse Case\n\nThis workflow is ideal for SEO professionals, content creators, and digital marketers who need to perform in-depth keyword research for blog content.
