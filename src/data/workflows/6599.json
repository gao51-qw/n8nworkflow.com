  "description": "# This n8n workflow scrapes LinkedIn data for your leads, feeds it into a GPT-4 AI agent, and generates laser-targeted, personalized icebreakers you can drop into your cold email campaigns.\n \nIt automates the personalization process at scale — saving you hours of research while sounding human and thoughtful.\n\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup (Beginner Friendly)\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Leads (Input Sheet)\n- Get your lead list based on your industry and niche from Apollo (free)\n- Copy the entire link\n- Go to Apify and use [this](https://apify.com/code_crafter/apollo-io-scraper/) Apollo Scraper to scrape the leads. \n- Download the result as CSV and upload the CSV to Google Sheets\n- Add a column at the end of the Sheet. Name this column as \"status\". Mark the entire column (every row) as \"un-enriched\" (this is important)\n- Connect your Google Sheets account to n8n\n- The workflow will pull leads from this sheet where status = un-enriched\n\n### Step 2: Set Your Credentials\n- Google Sheets: Connect your account to n8n using OAuth2\n- OpenAI: Add your OpenAI API credentials\n- Apify: Visit [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations) to get your Apify API key\n- Use [this Apify LinkedIn Profile Scraper](https://console.apify.com/actors/2SyF0bVxmgGr8IVCZ/) and copy the actorID --&gt; get it from the URL : https://console.apify.com/:actorID/input\n- Paste both Apify API Key and ActorID into the “Set Apify Tokens” node\n\n### Step 3: Customize the AI Agent\n- In the node “Generate Personalized Icebreaker”, adjust the system prompt.\n- Update it with your own niche, offer, tone, and insights\n- Keep the JSON output format exactly as shown. The rest of the workflow depends on it\n\n### Step 4: Run the Workflow\n- Click \"Execute Workflow\"\n- The system will:\n-- Pull all unenriched leads\n-- Filter out entries without email\n-- Scrape LinkedIn profiles using Apify\n-- Use GPT-4 to write a short, personalized icebreaker\n-- Save the result to a separate “Enriched” sheet\n-- Mark those leads as “enriched” in your original sheet\n\n## How It Works Behind the Scenes\n- Manual Trigger starts the workflow\n- Get Raw Leads from a Google Sheet (filter = un-enriched)\n- Filter for Valid Emails (hasEmail?)\n- Loop Over Leads\n- Set Apify API credentials\n- Call Apify’s LinkedIn Scraper using each lead's LinkedIn URL\n- Aggregate the scraped data\n- Simplify fields for AI prompt\n- Call OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini with structured, data-rich prompt to generate icebreaker\n- Append results to Enriched Sheet\n- Update original list’s status to prevent reprocessing\n- Loop continues to the next lead\n\n## Best Practices for Successful Use\n- Clean your leads: Remove unnecessary columns from your Google Sheet raw lead list\n- Throttle large batches: The Apify actor and OpenAI calls may hit rate limits. Process in small batches.\n- Customize prompt deeply: The better your AI instructions, the more believable your icebreakers will sound.\n- Use shortened company names and local slang: The system prompt already does this — keep it.\n- Avoid fluff: Keep the tone Spartan, specific, and real.\n\n## Ideal Use Cases\n- Cold email campaigns for SMB SaaS, agency offers, B2B sales\n- Personalized intros for LinkedIn DMs\n- Data enrichment for lead gen automation\n- Integrating with tools like Instantly.ai, Smartlead, or Mailshake\n\n## Demo Link\nWatch the full walkthrough and see it in action:\n👉 [Watch me build this LIVE on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sU-Y1Aes7CE)",
