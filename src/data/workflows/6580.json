  "description": "### How it Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow is your agency’s secret weapon. It’s a multi-AI-agent system that automates the entire process of competitor and market research, providing you with a complete strategic analysis in minutes.\n\n1.  **Digital Reconnaissance (Agent 1)**: The workflow is triggered with a client's business name and industry. The first AI agent, powered by **Apify**, immediately begins a deep dive into the market to identify and scrape data on the client’s top competitors.\n2.  **Strategic Analysis (Agent 2)**: All the raw data from Agent 1 is sent to the second AI agent, powered by **OpenAI (GPT-4)**. This agent performs a sophisticated analysis to summarize competitor messaging, identify their audience, and generate a full SWOT analysis for your client.\n3.  **Report & Strategy Generation (Agent 3)**: A third AI agent, also using **OpenAI**, takes the strategic analysis and writes a professional, persuasive report. This report is then automatically populated into a pre-designed **Google Docs** template, ready for review.\n4.  **Instant Delivery**: The final report is automatically sent to your internal team via **Slack**, allowing you to start your strategy meeting almost instantly after the workflow is triggered.\n\n### Setup Steps 🛠️\n\n1.  **Get Your Apify Actor**:\n    * Log in to Apify and find a suitable Actor for web scraping (e.g., `Google Search Results Scraper`).\n    * Copy the `Actor ID` to use in the n8n workflow.\n\n2.  **Prepare Your Report Template**:\n    * Create a new Google Doc to serve as your report template.\n    * Use placeholders like `{{ client_name }}`, `{{ report_content }}`, and `{{ client_industry }}` to define where the AI-generated text will go.\n    * Copy the document ID from the Google Doc URL and save it for later.\n\n3.  **Import the Workflow**:\n    * Copy the provided workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n\n4.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    * **Apify**: Add your Apify API Key.\n    * **OpenAI**: Add your OpenAI API Key.\n    * **Google Docs**: Add your OAuth2 credential.\n    * **Slack**: Add your Bot Token credential.\n\n5.  **Customize Workflow Nodes**:\n    * **Node 2 (`Apify`)**: Paste your `Actor ID` here. You can also customize the search queries in the `Input JSON` to be more specific.\n    * **Node 6 (`Google Docs`)**: Paste your template's `Document ID` here. Ensure the `Values` match the placeholders you created in your template.\n    * **Node 7 (`Slack`)**: Replace `[YOUR MARKETING TEAM SLACK CHANNEL ID]` with the correct channel ID where you want the report delivered.\n\n6.  **Activate & Test**:\n    * Once all settings are configured, save the workflow.\n    * Click the \"Inactive\" toggle to make it live.\n    * Run a test by manually entering a client's name and industry to ensure the data flows correctly and the report is delivered.",
