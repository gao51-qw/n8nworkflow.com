Eg. PDFs have only their text contents extracted and returned to the MCP client.\n\n### How to use\n* This Google Drive MCP server allows any compatible MCP client to manage a person or shared Google Drive. Simple select a drive or for better control, specify a folder within the drive to scope the operations to.\n* Connect your MCP client by following the n8n guidelines here - https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/#integrating-with-claude-desktop\n* Try the following queries in your MCP client:\n  * \"Please help me search for last month's expense reports.\"\n * \"What does the company policy document say about cancellations and refunds?\"\n\n### Requirements\n* Google Drive for documents.\n* OpenAI for image and audio understanding.\n* MCP Client or Agent for usage such as Claude Desktop - https://claude.ai/download\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Add additional capabilities such as renaming, moving and/or deleting files.\n* Remember to set the MCP server to require credentials before going to production and sharing this MCP server with others!",
