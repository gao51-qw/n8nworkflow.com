  "description": "This workflow automates the end-to-end process of **video dubbing** using **ElevenLabs**, storage on Google Drive, and publishing on **Youtube**.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for creators, agencies, and media teams that need to **TRANSLATE process** and publish large volumes of video content consistently.\n\nFor this workflow, I started from my [Italian YouTube Short](https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/play/580928/c445daec-e3fe-4019-b035-58ac3bf386dd), and by applying the same workflow, the result was this [English version](https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/play/580928/2179db44-e7e2-43e6-82a1-13b12e18ba8b).\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n#### 1. ✅ Full Automation of Video Localization\n\nThe entire process—from video download to AI dubbing and publishing—is automated, eliminating manual steps and reducing human error.\n\n#### 2. ✅ Fast Multilingual Content Scaling\n\nWith AI-powered dubbing, the same video can be quickly localized into different languages, enabling global audience expansion.\n\n#### 3. ✅ Efficient Time Management\n\nThe workflow intelligently waits for the dubbing process to finish using dynamic timing, avoiding unnecessary retries or failures.\n\n#### 4. ✅ Centralized Content Distribution\n\nA single workflow handles storage, social posting, and YouTube uploads, simplifying content operations across platforms.\n\n#### 5. ✅ Reduced Operational Costs\n\nAutomating dubbing and publishing significantly lowers costs compared to manual voiceovers, video editing, and uploads.\n\n#### 6. ✅ Easy Customization & Reusability\n\nParameters like video URL, language, title, and platform can be easily changed, making the workflow reusable for different projects or clients.\n\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1. The workflow begins with a manual trigger that sets input parameters: a video URL and the target language for dubbing (e.g., `en` for English).\n2. The video is fetched from the provided URL via an HTTP request.\n3. The video file is sent to the **ElevenLabs Dubbing API**, which initiates audio dubbing in the specified target language.\n4. The workflow then waits for a calculated duration (video length + 120 seconds) to allow the dubbing process to complete.\n5. After the wait, it checks the dubbing status using the `dubbing_id` and retrieves the final dubbed audio file.\n6. The dubbed video is then processed in parallel:\n   - Uploaded to **Google Drive** in a designated folder.\n   - Uploaded to **Postiz** for social media management.\n   - Uploaded via **Upload-Post.com API** for YouTube publishing.\n7. Finally, the workflow triggers a **Postiz** node to schedule or publish the content to YouTube with the prepared metadata.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\n1. **Configure Input Parameters**  \n   In the *Set params* node, define:\n   - `video_url`: Direct URL to the source video.\n   - `target_audio`: Language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`) for dubbing.\n\n2. **Set Up Credentials**  \n   Ensure the following credentials are configured in n8n:\n   - **[ElevenLabs API](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu)** (for dubbing)\n   - **Google Drive OAuth2** (for file upload)\n   - **[Postiz API](https://affiliate.postiz.com/n3witalia)** (for social media scheduling)\n   - **[Upload-Post.com API](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app)** (for YouTube upload)\n\n3. **Adjust Wait Time**  \n   Modify the *Wait* node if needed:  \n   `expected_duration_sec + 120` ensures enough time for dubbing. Adjust based on video length.\n\n4. **Customize Upload Destinations**  \n   Update folder IDs (Google Drive) and platform settings (Upload-Post.com) as needed.\n\n5. **Set Post Content**  \n   In the *Youtube Postiz* and *Youtube Upload-Post* nodes, replace `YOUR_CONTENT` and `YOUR_USERNAME` with actual titles, descriptions, and channel details.\n\n6. **Activate and Test**  \n   Activate the workflow in n8n, click *Execute workflow*, and monitor execution for errors. Ensure all API keys and permissions are valid.\n\n---\n\n👉 [Subscribe to my new **YouTube channel**](https://youtube.com/@n3witalia).
