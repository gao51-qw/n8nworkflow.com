It runs on a schedule (every day, or whenever you want).  \n2. It fetches data directly from the **Google Search Console API**.  \n3. It pulls 3 types of reports:  \n   - By **Query** (keywords people used).  \n   - By **Page** (URLs that ranked).  \n   - By **Date** (daily performance).  \n4. It splits and cleans the data so it’s human-friendly.  \n5. It saves everything into **Airtable**, organized in three tables.  \n\nEnd result: every time you open Airtable, you have a neat SEO database with clicks, impressions, CTR, and average position — no manual work required.  \n\n\n## Prerequisites  \n\nYou’ll need a few things to get started:  \n- Access to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).  \n- A [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with the Search Console API enabled.  \n- An [Airtable](https://airtable.com) account to store the data.  \n- An automation tool that can connect APIs (like the one we’re using here).  \n\nThat’s it!  \n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Schedule the Workflow  \n\nThe very first node in the workflow is the **Schedule Trigger**.  \n\n- **Why?** → So you don’t have to press “Run” every day.  \n- **What it does** → It starts the whole workflow at fixed times.  \n\nIn the JSON, you can configure things like:  \n- Run every day at a specific hour (e.g., 8 AM).  \n- Or run every X hours/minutes if you want more frequent updates.  \n\nThis is the alarm clock of your automation ⏰.  \n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Set Your Domain and Time Range  \n\nNext, we define the site and the time window for the report.  \n\nIn the JSON, there’s a **Set node** with two important parameters:  \n- `domain` → your website (example: `https://www.vvv.fr/`).  \n- `days` → how many days back you want the data (default: 30).  \n\n👉 Changing these two values updates the whole workflow. Super handy if you want 7-day reports instead of 30.  \n\n## Step 3: Fetch Data from Google Search Console  \n\nThis is where the workflow talks to the API.  \nThere are **3 HTTP Request nodes**:  \n\n1. **Get Query Report**  \n   - Pulls data grouped by search queries (keywords).  \n   - Parameters in the JSON:  \n     - `startDate` = today - 30 days  \n     - `endDate` = today  \n     - `dimensions` = `\"query\"`  \n     - `rowLimit` = `25000` (maximum rows the API can return)  \n\n2. **Get Page Report**  \n   - Same idea, but grouped by page URLs.  \n   - Parameters:  \n     - `dimensions` = `\"page\"`  \n     - Same dates and row limit.  \n\n3. **Get Date Report**  \n   - This one groups performance by date.  \n   - Parameters:  \n     - `dimensions` = `\"date\"`  \n     - You get a day-by-day performance view.  \n\nEach request returns rows like this:  \n\n\n{\n  \"keys\": [\"example keyword\"],\n  \"clicks\": 42,\n  \"impressions\": 1000,\n  \"ctr\": 0.042,\n  \"position\": 8.5\n}\n\n## Step 4: Split the Data  \n\nThe API sends results in a big array (`rows`). That’s not very usable directly.  \n\nSo we add a **Split Out node** for each report.  \n\n**What it does**: breaks the array into single items → 1 item per keyword, per page, or per date.  \n\nThis way, each line can be saved individually into Airtable.  \n\n👉 Think of it like opening a bag of candy and laying each one neatly on the table 🍬.  \n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Clean and Rename Fields  \n\nAfter splitting, we use **Edit Fields nodes** to make the data human-friendly.  \n\nFor example:  \n- In the **Query report** → rename `keys[0]` into `Keyword`.  \n- In the **Page report** → rename `keys[0]` into `page`.  \n- In the **Date report** → rename `keys[0]` into `date`.  \n\nThis is also where we keep only the useful fields:  \n- `Keyword` / `page` / `date`  \n- `clicks`  \n- `impressions`  \n- `ctr`  \n- `position`  \n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Save Everything into Airtable  \n\nFinally, the polished data is sent into Airtable.  \n\nIn the JSON, there are 3 Airtable nodes:  \n- **Queries table** → stores all the keywords.  \n- **Pages table** → stores all the URLs.  \n- **Dates table** → stores day-by-day metrics.  \n\nEach node is set to:  \n- **Operation** = `Create` → adds a new record.  \n- **Base** = `Search Console Reports`.  \n- **Table** = `Queries`, `Pages`, or `Dates`.  \n\n### Field Mapping  \n\nFor **Queries**:  \n- `Keyword` → `{{ $json.Keyword }}`  \n- `clicks` → `{{ $json.clicks }}`  \n- `impressions` → `{{ $json.impressions }}`  \n- `ctr` → `{{ $json.ctr }}`  \n- `position` → `{{ $json.position }}`  \n\n👉 Same logic for **Pages** and **Dates**, just replace `Keyword` with `page` or `date`.  \n\n---\n\n## Expected Output  \n\n\n\nEvery time this workflow runs:  \n- **Queries table** fills with fresh keyword performance data.  \n- **Pages table** shows how your URLs performed.  \n- **Dates table** tracks the evolution day by day.  \n\nIn Airtable, you now have a complete **SEO database** with no manual exports.  \n\n---\n\n## Why This Is Awesome  \n\n- 🚫 No more messy CSV exports.  \n- 📈 Data is always up-to-date.  \n- 🎛 You can build Airtable dashboards, filters, and interfaces.  \n- ⚙️ Easy to adapt → just change `domain` or `days` to customize.  \n\nAnd the best part? You can spend the time you saved on actual **SEO improvements** instead of spreadsheet gymnastics 💃.  \n\n## Need Help Automating Your Data Workflows?\n\nThis n8n workflow is perfect for **automating SEO reporting and data collection**.
