Captures message text, user ID, timestamp, and channel info.\n\n🧩 Validate Slack Message Payload (IF Node)\n Ensures the incoming message payload contains valid user and text data.\n ✅ True Path → Continues to extract and process the message\n ❌ False Path → Logs error to Google Sheets\n\n💻 Extract Question Metadata (JavaScript)\n Cleans and structures the Slack message into a standardized JSON format — removing unnecessary characters and preparing a clean “question object” for AI processing.\n\n🧠 Classify Developer Question (AI) (Powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4o)\n Uses GPT-4o to semantically compare the question with an internal FAQ dataset.\n If a match is found → Marks as answered and generates a canonical response\n If not → Flags it as unanswered\n\n🧾 Parse AI JSON Output (Code Node)\n Converts GPT-4o’s text output into structured JSON so that workflow logic can reference fields like status, answer_quality, and canonical_answer.\n\n⚖️ Check If Question Was Answered (IF Node)\n If status == \"answered\", the question is routed to Notion for documentation; otherwise, it’s logged in Airtable for review.\n\n📘 Save Answered Question to Notion FAQ\n Creates a new Notion page under the “FAQ” database containing the question, AI’s canonical answer, and answer quality rating — automatically building a self-updating internal FAQ.\n\n📋 Log Unanswered Question to Airtable\n Adds unresolved or new questions into Airtable for manual review by the developer support team. These records later feed back into the FAQ training loop.\n\n🚨 Log Workflow Errors to Google Sheets\n Any missing payloads, parsing errors, or failed integrations are logged in Google Sheets (error log sheet) for transparent tracking and debugging.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites:\n- Slack API credentials (for message trigger)\n- Azure OpenAI GPT-4o API credentials\n- Notion API connection (for FAQ database)\n- Airtable API credentials (for unresolved questions)\n- Google Sheets OAuth connection (for error logging)\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits:\n ✅ Automates Slack Q&A classification\n ✅ Builds and updates internal FAQs with zero manual input\n ✅ Ensures all developer queries are tracked\n ✅ Reduces redundant questions in Slack\n ✅ Maintains transparency with error logs\n\n## 👥 Perfect For:\n- Engineering or support teams using Slack for developer communication\n- Organizations maintaining internal FAQs in Notion\n- Teams wanting to automatically capture and reuse knowledge from real developer interactions\n",
