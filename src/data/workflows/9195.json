You simply provide the concept, topic, or description of a post, and the AI generates drafts adapted to multiple social media platforms — LinkedIn, Telegram, TikTok, YouTube, X/Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky and Threads. Posts are created in [PostPulse](https://post-pulse.com/) ready for review, scheduling, or publishing. \n\n⚠️ ***Disclaimer:*** This workflow uses the community node **@postpulse/n8n-nodes-postpulse**. Make sure community nodes are enabled in your n8n instance before importing and using this template.\n👉 **To install it:** Go to Settings → Community Nodes → Install and enter:\"@postpulse/n8n-nodes-postpulse\".\n💡 **For more details, see n8n Integration Guide:**[ PostPulse Developers – n8n Integration](https://developers.post-pulse.com/n8n-integration)\n\n## Who Is This For?\n\n- **Social media managers** who want to create content for multiple platforms quickly.\n- **Content creators** who need posts automatically adapted to different platforms’ character limits.\n- **Agencies** managing multiple accounts who want to save time on copywriting and formatting.\n\n## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\n\nInstead of manually writing, adapting, and publishing posts, you get:\n- **AI-powered content creation:** Generate posts from any idea you provide.\n- **Platform optimization:** Posts are automatically adapted to platform-specific character limits and formatting.\n- **Seamless publishing:** Draft posts are sent to PostPulse for scheduling or immediate publishing.\n- **Hashtag suggestions:** AI adds relevant hashtags for each platform.\n- **Time saving:** Automates content generation and publishing, freeing you for more strategic tasks.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis workflow takes your idea, generates platform-specific posts with AI, and sends them to PostPulse:\n\n**1. Idea input:** Enter any post concept in the idea node.\n**2. Setting Restrictions and Hashtags:** Optional: adjust character limits or the number of hashtags.\n**3. AI Content Adapter:** Generates text for each platform based on the input idea.\n**4. Unification of Platforms and Text + Merge:** Aligns AI-generated content with the correct platforms.\n**5. Publish Post**: Creates draft posts in PostPulse ready for scheduling or publishing.\n\n## Setup\n\n**1. Connect PostPulse to n8n**\n- Request your OAuth client key and secret from PostPulse support at support@post-pulse.com.\n- Add your PostPulse account in the Credentials section in n8n.\n\n**2. Enter an idea in the idea node**\n- Type any concept, topic, or description of a post.\n\n**3. (Optional) Adjust restrictions in Setting Restrictions and Hashtags node**\n- Change maximum characters per platform or number of hashtags if desired.\n\n**4. Run the workflow**\n- AI generates platform-specific drafts and sends them to PostPulse as draft posts.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Connected PostPulse accounts** (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Telegram, Bluesky, X, Threads).\n- **OAuth client key and secret** obtained from PostPulse.\n- **An n8n instance** with community nodes enabled.\n\n✨ With this workflow, PostPulse and n8n become your all-in-one automation hub for generating and publishing social media posts. \n\n## How To Customize The Workflow\nThis workflow is flexible and adaptable to your needs:\n- **Character limits:** Adjust maximum characters per platform while respecting platform limits.\n- **Hashtags:** Modify the number of hashtags added by the AI.\n- **AI prompt:** Change text tone or style in the AI Content Adapter node.\n- **Add platforms:** Extend supported platforms by updating platform mappings in the workflow.\n- **Scheduling:** Adjust scheduledTime in Publish Post node for automated scheduling.\n\n**💡 Tip:** Fully functional out-of-the-box, but easily customizable to match your brand’s tone, posting strategy, or any platform-specific rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
