  "description": "# AWS News Analysis and LinkedIn Automation Pipeline\n\nTransform AWS industry news into engaging LinkedIn content with AI-powered analysis and automated approval workflows.\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis template is perfect for:\n- **Cloud architects and DevOps engineers** who want to stay current with AWS developments\n- **Content creators** looking to automate their AWS news coverage\n- **Marketing teams** needing consistent, professional AWS content\n- **Technical leaders** who want to share industry insights on LinkedIn\n- **AWS consultants** building thought leadership through automated content\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow creates a comprehensive AWS news analysis and content generation pipeline with two main flows:\n\n### Flow 1: News Collection and Analysis\n1. **Scheduled RSS Monitoring**: Automatically fetches latest AWS news from the official AWS RSS feed daily at 8 PM\n2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) to analyze each news item, extracting:\n   - Professional summary\n   - Key themes and keywords\n   - Importance rating (Low/Medium/High)\n   - Business impact assessment\n3. **Structured Data Storage**: Saves analyzed news to Feishu Bitable with approval status tracking\n\n### Flow 2: LinkedIn Content Generation\n1. **Manual Approval Trigger**: Feishu automation sends approved news items to the webhook\n2. **AI Content Creation**: AWS Bedrock generates professional LinkedIn posts with:\n   - Attention-grabbing headlines\n   - Technical insights from a Solutions Architect perspective\n   - Business impact analysis\n   - Call-to-action engagement\n3. **Automated Publishing**: Posts directly to LinkedIn with relevant hashtags\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Prerequisites\n- **AWS Bedrock access** with Claude 3 Sonnet model enabled\n- **Feishu account** with Bitable access\n- **LinkedIn company account** with posting permissions\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n### Detailed Configuration Steps\n\n#### 1. AWS Bedrock Setup\n\n**Step 1: Enable Claude 3 Sonnet Model**\n1. Log into your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)\n2. Navigate to [AWS Bedrock](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)\n3. Go to **Model access** in the left sidebar\n4. Find **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet** and click **Request model access**\n5. Fill out the access request form (usually approved within minutes)\n6. Once approved, verify the model appears in your **Model access** list\n\n**Step 2: Create IAM User and Credentials**\n1. Go to [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\n2. Click **Users** → **Create user**\n3. Name: `n8n-bedrock-user`\n4. Attach policy: `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` (or create custom policy with minimal permissions)\n5. Go to **Security credentials** tab → **Create access key**\n6. Choose **Application running outside AWS**\n7. Download the credentials CSV file\n\n**Step 3: Configure in n8n**\n1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** → **Add credential**\n2. Select **AWS** credential type\n3. Enter your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key\n4. Set Region to your preferred AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)\n5. Test the connection\n\n**Useful Links:**\n- [AWS Bedrock Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)\n- [Claude 3 Sonnet Model Access](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess)\n- [AWS Bedrock Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/)\n\n#### 2. Feishu Bitable Configuration\n\n**Step 1: Create Feishu Account and App**\n1. Sign up at [Feishu International](https://www.feishu.cn/en/) \n2. Create a new **Bitable** (multi-dimensional table)\n3. Go to **Developer Console** → **Create App**\n4. Enable **Bitable** permissions in your app\n5. Generate **App Token** and **App Secret**\n\n**Step 2: Create Bitable Structure**\n1.

Get your **App Token** and **Table ID**:\n   - App Token: Found in app settings\n   - Table ID: Found in the Bitable URL (`tbl...`)\n\n**Step 3: Set Up Automation**\n1. In your Bitable, go to **Automation** → **Create automation**\n2. Trigger: **When field value changes** → Select `approval_status` field\n3. Condition: **approval_status equals \"Approved\"**\n4. Action: **Send HTTP request**\n   - Method: POST\n   - URL: Your n8n webhook URL (from Flow 2)\n   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`\n   - Body: `{{record}}`\n\n**Step 4: Configure Feishu Credentials in n8n**\n1. Install **Feishu Lite** community node (self-hosted only)\n2. Add Feishu credential with your App Token and App Secret\n3. Test the connection\n\n**Useful Links:**\n- [Feishu Developer Documentation](https://open.feishu.cn/document/)\n- [Bitable API Reference](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/bitable-v1/overview)\n- [Feishu Automation Guide](https://www.feishu.cn/hc/en-US/articles/360040328273)\n\n#### 3. LinkedIn Company Account Setup\n\n**Step 1: Create LinkedIn App**\n1. Go to [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)\n2. Click **Create App**\n3. Fill in app details:\n   - App name: `AWS News Automation`\n   - LinkedIn Page: Select your company page\n   - App logo: Upload your logo\n   - Legal agreement: Accept terms\n\n**Step 2: Configure OAuth2 Settings**\n1. In your app, go to **Auth** tab\n2. Add redirect URL: `https://your-n8n-instance.com/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`\n3. Request these scopes:\n   - `w_member_social` (Post on behalf of members)\n   - `r_liteprofile` (Read basic profile)\n   - `r_emailaddress` (Read email address)\n\n**Step 3: Get Company Page Access**\n1. Go to your [LinkedIn Company Page](ex. https://www.linkedin.com/company/105783641)\n2. Navigate to **Admin tools** → **Manage admins**\n3. Ensure you have **Content admin** or **Super admin** role\n4. Note your **Company Page ID** (found in page URL)\n\n**Step 4: Configure LinkedIn Credentials in n8n**\n1. Add **LinkedIn OAuth2** credential\n2. Enter your Client ID and Client Secret\n3. Complete OAuth2 flow by clicking **Connect my account**\n4. Select your company page for posting\n\n**Useful Links:**\n- [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)\n- [LinkedIn API Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/)\n- [LinkedIn OAuth2 Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow)\n\n#### 4. Workflow Activation\n\n**Final Setup Steps:**\n1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n\n2. Configure all credential connections:\n   - AWS Bedrock credentials\n   - Feishu credentials\n   - LinkedIn OAuth2 credentials\n3. Update webhook URL in Feishu automation to match your n8n instance\n4. Activate the scheduled trigger (daily at 8 PM)\n5. Test with manual webhook trigger using sample data\n6.
