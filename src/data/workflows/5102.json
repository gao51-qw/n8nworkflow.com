  "description": "## Google Sheets UI for Workflow Control\n\nThis n8n template provides a practical and efficient way to manage your n8n workflows using Google Sheets as a user-friendly interface. It demonstrates how to leverage a simple spreadsheet to control inputs, capture outputs, and track the processing status of individual data rows, offering a clear and visual overview of your automation tasks.\n\n### Purpose of This Template:\n\nThe primary purpose of this template is to illustrate how Google Sheets can serve as a dynamic UI for your n8n automations. It's designed for n8n users who need:\n\n- A structured method to feed specific data into their workflows.\n- The ability to selectively trigger workflow execution based on data status.\n- A centralized place to view and store workflow outputs alongside original inputs.\n- A simple, no-code solution for managing workflow data without building custom applications.\n\n### Setup Instructions:\n\nTo use this template, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Google Sheet:** Set up a new Google Sheet ([see the template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13xu9zKI8yDqs7971qIq9zDCBCnhYzdVq8pdtnQ9vMkI/edit?usp=sharing)) with three columns: `Color`, `Status`, and `Number`. Populate the `Color` column with some sample data (e.g., color names) and set the `Status` for the rows you want to process to `READY`.\n2. **Import the n8n Workflow:** Import this n8n template into your n8n instance.\n3. **Configure Google Sheets Nodes:**\n   - For the first Google Sheets node (Read operation), ensure it's connected to your newly created Google Sheet and configured to read rows where the `Status` column is `READY`. You will need to authenticate your Google Sheets account.\n   - For the second Google Sheets node (Update operation), ensure it's also connected to the same Google Sheet. The node should automatically map the `row_number`, `Number`, and `Status` fields from the preceding nodes.\n4. **Execute the Workflow:** Run the workflow. Observe how it reads `READY` rows, processes them (calculates string length), and updates the `Number` and `Status` columns in your Google Sheet to `DONE`.\n5. **Control Execution:** To process new data, simply add new rows to your Google Sheet and set their `Status` to `READY`. Rerunning the workflow will then only process these new entries.\n\nFor more details and context on this approach, you can refer to the related blog post [here](https://n8nplaybook.com/post/2025/06/google-sheets-as-n8n-ui/).",
