Designed for carriers, actuaries, and underwriting teams managing usage-based insurance programs, it eliminates manual review of driving patterns, speed, braking, and mileage while ensuring compliance. Scheduled execution fetches telematics data via HTTP from vehicles or mobile apps. Anthropic Claude analyzes behavior with structured output parsing, generating risk scores from acceleration, harsh braking, speeding, and time-of-day driving.
