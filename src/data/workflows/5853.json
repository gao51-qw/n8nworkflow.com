  "description": "### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is for businesses and individuals who want to automate calendar management via WhatsApp using n8n. It’s ideal for appointment-based services, consultants, and anyone who needs to streamline event scheduling, updates, or cancellations through a simple chat interface.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\nManually managing calendar events is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when clients communicate through messaging apps like WhatsApp. This workflow solves the problem by connecting WhatsApp to Google Calendar, enabling users to manage events directly via chat, reducing administrative overhead and response times.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThis workflow enables WhatsApp-based interaction with Google Calendar. Users can:\n- Create new events\n- Update existing events\n- Delete events\n- Retrieve a list of scheduled events\n\nOptionally, AI (like ChatGPT or Gemini) can be used to interpret natural language inputs, making the interaction even smoother.\n\n### Setup\n1. Add credentials:\n   - WhatsApp: Connect your WhatsApp API (OAuth or other supported method).\n   - Google Calendar: Add your Google account credentials to allow calendar access.\n   - AI (optional): Add credentials for ChatGPT, Gemini, or another language model if using AI for natural language parsing.\n2. Import the workflow into n8n and review all nodes.\n3. Test the WhatsApp webhook to ensure it’s receiving messages correctly.\n4. Connect to your Google Calendar and test event creation and retrieval.",
