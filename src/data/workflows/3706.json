This workflow automates:  \n- **Transcript analysis** using AI (OpenAI) to identify relevant content.  \n- **HubSpot integration** to log meeting notes against client records.  \n- **Email routing** to ensure feedback reaches the correct departments (e.g., support, sales, product, admin).  \n\n## **What this workflow does**  \n1. **Input Transcript**: Accepts a client conversation transcript (e.g., from emails, calls, or chats).  \n2. **HubSpot Sync**:  \n   - Searches for the client’s HubSpot ID using their email.  \n   - Uploads a summarized version of the conversation as meeting notes.  \n3. **AI-Powered Routing**:  \n   - Uses an OpenAI model to analyze the transcript and categorize content by department.  \n   - Triggers emails (via Gmail) to route feedback to the relevant teams.  \n4. **Form Completion**: Ends the workflow with optional user confirmation.  \n\n## **Setup**  \n1. **Prerequisites**:  \n   - n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).  \n   - HubSpot API credentials (for contact lookup and notes upload).  \n   - OpenAI API key (for transcript analysis).  \n   - Gmail account (for sending emails).  \n2. **Configuration**:  \n   - Replace placeholder nodes (e.g., HubSpot, OpenAI, Gmail) with your authenticated accounts.  \n   - Define email templates and recipient addresses for routing.  \n   - Adjust the OpenAI prompt to match your categorization criteria (e.g., \"support,\" \"billing\").  \n\n## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**  \n- **Transcript Sources**: Extend the workflow to pull transcripts from other sources (e.g., Zoom, Slack).  \n- **Departments**: Modify the routing logic to include additional teams or conditions.  \n- **Notifications**: Add Slack/MS Teams alerts for urgent feedback.  \n- **Error Handling**: Introduce retries or fallback actions for failed HubSpot/Gmail steps.
