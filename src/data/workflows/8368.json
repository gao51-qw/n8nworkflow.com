  "description": "## Analyze YouTube videos for virality with an AI-powered report\n\nThis workflow automates the discovery and analysis of potentially viral YouTube videos. It searches for recent, popular videos based on a keyword, calculates a unique **\"Algorithmic Lift Score\"** to measure virality, and uses an AI agent to generate an insightful summary report that is sent directly to your email.\n\n## What it does\n\nThis workflow identifies videos that are outperforming their channel's baseline, a key indicator of viral potential. It operates in several stages:\n1.  **Searches YouTube:** It finds recent, top-performing videos based on your specified keyword and timeframe.\n2.  **Gathers Data:** For each video found, it fetches detailed statistics for both the video (views, likes, comments) and its channel (subscriber count, total views).\n3.  **Calculates Virality Score:** It calculates an \"Algorithmic Lift Score\" for each video. This custom metric prioritizes videos that achieve high view counts and engagement relative to their channel's subscriber base.\n4.  **Analyzes with AI:** The top 5 videos, sorted by their virality score, are sent to an AI agent (pre-configured for OpenAI). The AI generates a concise summary highlighting trends, top performers, and other noteworthy patterns.\n5.  **Sends Email Report:** The final AI-generated analysis is converted to HTML and emailed to you, providing a ready-to-read report on what's trending in your niche.\n\n## Who it's for\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n*   **Content Creators** looking for trending topics and content ideas.\n*   **Digital Marketers** conducting competitor analysis or market research.\n*   **Social Media Managers** wanting to understand what content resonates on YouTube.\n*   **Data Analysts** who need to automate the collection and analysis of YouTube trends.\n\n## Requirements\n\n*   A **Google API Key** with the \"YouTube Data API v3\" enabled.\n*   An **OpenAI API Key** (or another compatible AI model credential).\n*   A connected **Gmail account** in n8n to send the final report.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1.  **Configure the `Setup` Node:** Click on the \"Setup\" node and fill in the values:\n    *   `query`: The keyword you want to search for (e.g., \"AI tools\").\n    *   `GoogleAPIkey`: Your Google API key.\n    *   `daysback`: How many days in the past to search for new videos.\n    *   `maxResult`: The number of videos to analyze (e.g., 20).\n    *   `email`: The email address where the report will be sent.\n2.  **Set AI Credentials:** Click the \"OpenAI Chat Model\" node and add your OpenAI API key to the credentials.\n3.  **Set Gmail Credentials:** Click the \"Send_Report\" node and connect your Gmail account to the credentials.\n\n",
