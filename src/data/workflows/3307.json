  "description": "*Tags: Productivity, Pomodoro, Organization*\n\n### Context  \nHey! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) , a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com) 🌱\n\nA significant improvement in my productivity came from following the **Pomodoro Technique**.\n\n### What is the Pomodoro Technique?  \nThe Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks your workday into 25-minute focus intervals followed by short breaks. After 4 cycles, you take a longer break to recharge.  \nIt helps maintain concentration while preventing burnout.\n\n![Explaination](https://runmefit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-the-Pomodoro-Technique-Works.jpg)\n\nI’ve used this technique with web apps to receive break/work notifications. But I always wished I had a way to **track my sessions** for self-assessment.\n\n&gt; Let’s use **n8n** to boost our productivity and log our deep work sessions automatically!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, you can add me on [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who Is This Template For?  \nI built this workflow for creators, freelancers, students, and professionals who love the Pomodoro technique but want more than just timers — they want data.\n\nThis template helps you:\n- Track every deep work session automatically\n- Store logs in Google Sheets for later analysis\n- Stay in control via Telegram commands  \n\nThere is no need to pay for premium apps. It’s all **free** and powered by **n8n**.\n\n### How Does It Work?  \nThis Telegram bot tracks your Pomodoro sessions and sends you alerts during the process.\n\n**Here’s what happens:**\n\n1. A user sends `/start` to the bot.\n2. It launches a 25-minute deep work timer.\n3. After 25 minutes, the bot sends a break reminder.\n4. **After four cycles**, a long break is triggered and the session is logged.\n5. The session is **automatically recorded to Google Sheets** with (Date & Time, User ID, Pomodoro count, Session ID, Duration of focus and breaks)\n\n![Example of chat interaction](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-10.png)\n\n### What Gets Tracked?\n\n| Field              | Description                          |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Date & Time        | When the session was logged          |\n| User ID           | Your Telegram ID                     |\n| Block Type    | Deep Work or Short Break\n| Pomodoro Count    | Number of cycles completed            |\n| Working Session ID        | Unique ID for each session           |\n| Focus Duration    | Length of each deep work session     |\n| Break Duration    | Short or long break info             |\n\nYou can use this workflow as a base to bring additional features like:\n- Connecting with tasks from **Google Task**\n- Send automated productivity reports to monitor your activity\n- Link a Pomodoro with a task using **Google Calendar**\n\n\n### What Do I Need to Start?\n\nThis workflow is beginner-friendly — **no coding required**.\n\n- **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheet API** credentials\n- A Google Sheet set up to log sessions (with the columns of the table above)\n- API Credentials:\n  - **Google Sheets API** (OAuth2)\n  - **Telegram Bot Token**\n- Telegram app to chat with the bot\n\n&gt; The template is plug-and-play. Just follow the sticky notes in the n8n editor to configure it.\n\n### Next Steps  \nFollow the sticky notes in the n8n workflow editor to:\n\n- Set your credentials  \n- Connect your Google Sheet  \n- Initialize the static data  \n- Launch your first `/start` command on Telegram\n\n[![Tutorial ScreenShot](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/04/Pomodoro-Timer.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztMMrmbgGEo)\n  \n🎥 [**Watch My Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztMMrmbgGEo)\n\n🚀 Curious how n8n can supercharge **productivity and learning skills?**?  \n📬 Let’s connect on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\nThis workflow has been created with N8N 1.82.1\nSubmitted: March 24th, 2025",
