  "description": "This n8n template monitors active support issues in Linear.app to track the mood of their ongoing conversation between reporter and assignee using Sentiment Analysis. When sentiment dips into the negative, a notification is sent via Slack to alert the team.\n\n## How it works\n* A scheduled trigger is used to fetch recently updated issues in Linear using the GraphQL node.\n* Each issue's comments thread is passed into a simple Information Extractor node to identify the overall sentiment.\n* The resulting sentiment analysis combined with the some issue details are uploaded to Airtable for review.\n* When the template is re-run at a later date, each issue is re-analysed for sentiment\n* Each issue's new sentiment state is saved to the airtable whilst its previous state is moved to the \"previous sentiment\" column.\n* An Airtable trigger is used to watch for recently updated rows\n* Each matching Airtable row is filtered to check if it has a previous non-negative state but now has a negative state in its current sentiment.\n* The results are sent via notification to a team slack channel for priority.\n\n**Check out the sample Airtable here**: [https://airtable.com/appViDaeaFw4qv9La/shrq6HgeYzpW6uwXL](https://airtable.com/appViDaeaFw4qv9La/shrq6HgeYzpW6uwXL)\n\n## How to use\n* Modify the GraphQL filter to fetch issues to a relevant issue type, team or person.\n* Update the Slack channel to ensure messages are sent to the correct location or persons.\n* The Airtable also serves to give a snapshot of Sentiment across support tickets for a given period. It's possible to use this to assess the daily operations.\n\n## Requirements\n* Linear for issue tracking (but feel free to use another system if preferred)\n* Airtable for Database\n* OpenAI for LLM and Sentiment Analysis\n\n## Customising the workflow\n* Add more granular levels of sentiment to reduce the number of alerts.\n* Explore different types of sentiment based on issue types and customer types.
