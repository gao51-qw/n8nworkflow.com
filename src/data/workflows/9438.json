  "description": "# N8n OpenAI-Compatible API Endpoints\n\nTransform your n8n workflows into OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, allowing you to access multiple workflows as selectable AI models through a single integration.\n\n## What This Does\n\nThis workflow creates two API endpoints that mimic the OpenAI API structure:\n\n- `/models` - Lists all n8n workflows tagged with `aimodel` (or any other tag of your choice)\n- `/chat/completions` - Executes chat completions with your selected workflows, supporting both text and stream responses \n\n## Benefits\n\n**Access Multiple Workflows**: Connect to all your n8n agents through one API endpoint instead of creating separate pipelines for each workflow.\n\n**Universal Platform Support**: Works with any application that supports OpenAI-compatible APIs, including OpenWebUI, Microsoft Teams, Zoho Cliq, and Slack.\n\n**Simple Workflow Management**: Add new workflows by tagging them with `aimodel` . No code changes needed.\n\n**Streaming Support**: Handles both standard responses and streaming for real-time agent interactions .\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Download the workflow JSON file from this repository\n2. Import it into your n8n instance\n3. Tag your workflows with `aimodel`  to make them accessible through the API\n4. Create a new OpenAI credential in n8n and change the Base URL to point to your n8n webhook endpoints . [Learn more about OpenAI Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/) \n5. Point your chat applications to your n8n webhook URL as if it were an OpenAI API endpoint\n\n## Requirements\n\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- Workflows you want to expose as AI models\n- Any OpenAI-compatible chat application\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor detailed setup instructions and implementation guide, visit [https://medium.com/@deleodufuye/how-to-create-openai-compatible-api-endpoints-for-multiple-n8n-workflows-803987f15e24](https://medium.com/@deleodufuye/how-to-create-openai-compatible-api-endpoints-for-multiple-n8n-workflows-803987f15e24).\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis approach was inspired by [Jimleuk’s workflow on n8n Templates.](https://n8n.io/workflows/4217-create-openai-compatible-api-using-github-models-for-free-ai-access/)\n\n",
