Save your changes.\n![imagen11.png](fileId:3419)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **HubSpot:** An account with a Private App Token and Read/Write permissions for **Contacts** objects.\n- **Beex:** An account with lead generation permissions and a Bearer Token configured in the Trigger Node.\n- **Event Configuration:** In the Beex platform's **API Key & Callback** section, enable the following events:\n  - \"Update general and custom contact data\"\n  - \"Networking\"\n![CAPTURE.PNG](fileId:3421)\n\n## Customization Options\n\n- **Contact Filtering:** Add filters to control which Beex leads should sync to HubSpot.\n- **Identifier Configuration:** By default, only leads with a valid email address are processed to ensure accurate matching in HubSpot CRM. You can modify this logic to apply additional restrictions.\n- **Field Mapping:** The \"Set Fields Update\" node is the primary customization point. Here you can map Beex fields to HubSpot properties for both creation and update operations (see Step 4 in How It Works).\n- **Field Compatibility:** Ensure that Beex custom fields are compatible with HubSpot's default or custom properties; otherwise, API calls will fail due to schema mismatches.",
