  "description": "### How it works\n\nThis template provides a complete, ready-to-use web application for generating high-quality AI prompts. It features a user-friendly web form where you can describe your goal, and it leverages an AI model (Google Gemini) to create a structured, reusable prompt for you.\n\nThe workflow is a full-stack application built entirely within n8n:\n\n1.  **Frontend (The Form):** A **Form Trigger** node creates a beautiful, public-facing web form. Here, a user describes the prompt they need and selects which structural components to include (like system instructions, examples, or input variables).\n2.  **Backend (The AI Logic):**\n    *   A **LangChain Chain** node takes the user's request and constructs a \"meta-prompt\"—a set of instructions for the AI on how to generate the final prompt.\n    *   The **Google Gemini** node executes this meta-prompt, creating a well-structured output with clear sections and tags.\n3.  **The Result (The Webpage):**\n    *   After generation, the user is automatically redirected to a new URL.\n    *   This URL is handled by another **Webhook** node, which serves a custom-coded HTML page.\n    *   This beautiful, dark-themed webpage displays the generated prompt and includes a one-click \"Copy\" button, making it easy to use the result immediately.\n\nThis template is a perfect example of how to build interactive web tools with n8n, combining a user interface, backend logic, and a dynamic web response in a single workflow.\n\n### Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~1-3 minutes**\n\nThis workflow requires a Google AI credential to function.\n\n1.  **Configure Google AI Credentials:**\n    *   This workflow uses a Google Gemini model. You will need a Google AI API key.\n    *   In n8n, go to **Credentials** and click **Add credential**.\n    *   Search for **Google Gemini** and enter your API key.\n    *   Go back to the workflow, open the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** node, and select your newly created credential from the dropdown.\n\n2.  **Activate the Workflow:**\n    *   Click the **Active** toggle in the top-right corner to turn the workflow on.\n\n3.  **Access Your Prompt Maker:**\n    *   Open the **Prompt Request (Form Trigger)** node.\n    *   Copy the **Public URL** provided. This is the link to your new web application!\n    *   Open the link in your browser, fill out the form, and see the magic happen.\n\n**Note:** This workflow uses environment variables like `{{ $env.WEBHOOK_URL }}` to build the redirect URL. These are typically set automatically by n8n and should work out-of-the-box on most standard n8n setups.",
