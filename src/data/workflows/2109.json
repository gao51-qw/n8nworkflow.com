This message has a few quick actions: `Open LinkedIn profile` and `Email member`\n\n\n\n## Setup instructions\nOverview is below.

Complete the `Set up credentials` step when you first open the workflow. You'll need a Discourse (admin user), Clearbit, and Slack account.\n2. Set up the Webhook in Discourse, linking the `On new Discourse user` Trigger with your Discourse community.\n3. Set the correct channel to send to in the `Post message in channel` step\n4.
