  "description": "### Who is it for?\n\nThis workflow is for **marketers, sales teams, and local businesses** who want to quickly collect leads (business name, phone, website, and email) from Google Maps and store them in Airtable.\n\nYou can use it for **real estate agents, restaurants, therapists, or any local niche**.\n\nIf you need a **professional automation agency** to build advanced lead generation systems like this, check out [Vision IA's n8n automation services](https://visionia.io/agence-n8n).\n\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Scrape Google Maps** with [Apify Google Maps Extractor](https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor).\n2. **Clean and structure the data** (name, address, phone, website).\n3. **Visit each website** and retrieve the raw HTML.\n4. **Use GPT** to extract the most relevant email from the site content.\n5. **Save everything to Airtable** for easy filtering and future outreach.\n\nIt works for **any location or keyword** – just adapt the input in Apify.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore running this workflow, you’ll need:\n\n- ✅ **Apify account** (to use the Google Maps Extractor)\n- ✅ **OpenAI API key** (for GPT email extraction)\n- ✅ **Airtable account & base** with the following fields:\n  - `Business Name`\n  - `Address`\n  - `Website`\n  - `Phone Number`\n  - `Email`\n  - `Google Maps URL`\n\n---\n\n## Airtable Structure\n\nYour Airtable base should contain these columns:\n\n## Airtable Structure\n\n| Title                   | Street                  | Website            | Phone Number    | Email                  | URL                  |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Paris Real Estate Agency| 10 Rue de Rivoli, Paris | https://agency.fr  | +33 1 23 45 67  | contact@agency.fr      | maps.google.com/...  |\n| Example Business 2      | 25 Avenue de l’Opéra    | https://example.fr | +33 1 98 76 54  | info@example.fr        | maps.google.com/...  |\n| Example Business 3      | 8 Boulevard Haussmann   | https://demo.fr    | +33 1 11 22 33  | contact@demo.fr        | maps.google.com/...  |\n\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\n- **Missing websites:** If a business has no website, the flow skips the scraping step.\n- **No email found:** GPT returns `Null` if no email is detected.\n- **API rate limits:** Add a `Wait` node between requests to avoid Apify/OpenAI throttling.\n\n![baptistefortleadslocalgooglemapsn8n.png](fileId:1692)\n\nNow let’s take a detailed look at how to set up this automation, using real estate agencies in Paris as an example.\n\n## Step 1 – Launch the Google Maps Scraper\n\nStart with a When clicking Execute workflow trigger to launch the flow manually.\n\nThen, **add an HTTP Request** node with the method set to POST.\n\n👉 Head over to Apify: Google Maps Extractor\n\n![baptistefortrecupererleadsn8ngooglemaps.png](fileId:1695)\n\nOn the page: [https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor](https://apify.com/compass/google-maps-extractor)\n\nEnter your business keyword (e.g., real estate agency, hairdresser, restaurant)\n\nSet the location you want to target (e.g., Paris, France)\n\nChoose how many results to fetch (e.g., 50)\n\nOptionally, use filters (only places with a website, by category, etc.)\n\n⚠️ No matter your industry, this works — just adapt the keyword and location.\n\nOnce everything is filled in:\n\nClick Run to test.\n\nThen, go to the top right → click on API.\n\nSelect the API endpoints tab.\n\nChoose Run Actor synchronously and get dataset items.\n\n![baptistefortscrapergooglemapsn8nleads.png](fileId:1701)\n\nCopy the URL and paste it into your HTTP Request (in the URL field).\n\nThen enable:\n\n✅ Body Content Type → JSON\n✅ Specify Body Using JSON`\n\nGo back to Apify, click on the JSON tab, copy the entire code, and paste it into the JSON body field of your HTTP Request.\n\n![baptistefortn8nemailtelephonegooglemaps.png](fileId:1694)\n\nAt this point, if you run your workflow, you should see a structured output similar to this:\n\ntitle  \nsubTitle  \nprice  \ncategoryName  \naddress  \nneighborhood  \nstreet  \ncity  \npostalCode\n........\n\n## Step 2 – Clean and structure the data\n\n![baptistefortworkflowleadsn8n.png](fileId:1698)\n\nOnce the raw data is fetched from Apify, we clean it up using the Edit Fields node.\n\nIn this step, we manually select and rename the fields we want to keep:\n\nTitle → {{ $json.title }}\n\nAddress → {{ $json.address }}\n\nWebsite → {{ $json.website }}\n\nPhone → {{ $json.phone }}\n\nURL → {{ $json.url }}*\n\nThis node lets us keep only the essentials in a clean format, ready for the next steps.\nOn the right: a clear and usable table, easy to work with.\n\n## Step 3 – Loop Over Items\n\n![baptistefortleadsgooglemapsn8n.png](fileId:1702)\n\nNow that our data is clean (see step 2), we’ll go through it item by item to handle each contact individually.\n\nThe Loop Over Items node does exactly that:\n\nit takes each row from the table (each contact pulled from Apify) and runs the next steps on them, one by one.\n\n👉 Just set a Batch Size of 20 (or more, depending on your needs).\n\nNothing tricky here, but this step is essential to keep the flow dynamic and scalable.\n\n## Step 4 – Edit Field (again)\n\n![workflowleadsgooglen8nbaptistefort.png](fileId:1697)\n\nAfter looping through each contact one by one (thanks to Loop Over Items), we're refining the data a bit more.\n\nThis time, we only want to keep the website.\n\nWe use the Edit Fields node again, in Manual Mapping mode, with just:\n\nWebsite → {{ $json.website }}\n\nThe result on the right? A clean list with only the URLs extracted from Google Maps.\n\n🔧 This simple step helps isolate the websites so we can scrape them one by one in the next part of the flow.\n\n## Step 5 – Scrape Each Website with an HTTP Request\n\n![n8nautomationbaptistefortgooglemaps.png](fileId:1700)\n\nLet’s continue the flow: in the previous step, we isolated the websites into a clean list. Now, we’re going to send a request to each URL to fetch the content of the site.\n\n➡️ To do this, we add an HTTP Request node, using the GET method, and set the URL as:\n\n{{ $json.website }} This value comes from the previous Edit Fields input\n\nThis node will simply “visit” each website automatically and return the raw HTML code (as shown on the right).\n\n📄 That’s the material we’ll use in the next step to extract email addresses (and any other useful info).\n\nWe’re not reading this code manually — we’ll scan through it line by line to detect patterns that matter to us.\n\nThis is a technical but crucial step: it’s how we turn a URL into real, usable data. \n\n## Step 6 – Extract the Email with GPT\n\n![workflown8nleadssecteurbaptistefort.png](fileId:1699)\n\nNow that we've retrieved all the raw HTML from the websites using the HTTP Request node, it's time to analyze it.\n\n💡 Goal: detect the most relevant email address on each site (ideally the main contact or owner).\n\n👉 To do that, we’ll use an OpenAI node (Message a Model). Here’s how to configure it:\n\n⚙️ Key Parameters:\nModel: GPT-4-1-MINI (or any GPT-4+ model available)\n\nOperation: Message a Model\n\nResource: Text\n\nSimplify Output: ON\n\n**Prompt (message you provide):**\n\nLook at this website content and extract only the email I can contact this business. In your output, provide only the email and nothing else. Ideally, this email should be of the business owner, so if you have 2 or more options, try for most authoritative one. If you don't find any email, output 'Null'.\n\nExemplary output of yours:\n\nname@examplewebsite.com\n\n{{ $json.data }} \n\n## Step 7 – Save the Data in Airtable\n\n![leadslocauxn8ngooglebaptistefort.png](fileId:1693)\n\nOnce we’ve collected everything — the business name, address, phone number, website… \n\nand most importantly the email extracted via ChatGPT — we need to store all of this somewhere clean and organized.\n\n👉 The best place in this workflow is Airtable.\n\n📦 Why Airtable?\nBecause it allows you to:\n\nEasily view and sort the leads you've scraped\n\nFilter, tag, or enrich them later\n\nAnd most importantly… reuse them in future automations\n\n⚙️ What we're doing here\nWe add an Airtable → Create Record node to insert each lead into our database.\n\nInside this node, we manually map each field with the data collected in the previous steps:\n\n![baptistefortn8nrecupererleadslocaux.png](fileId:1696)\n\n| Airtable Field | Description              | Value from n8n                             |\n| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| `Title`        | Business name            | `{{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Title }}`   |\n| `Street`       | Full address             | `{{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Address }}` |\n| `Website`      | Website URL              | `{{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Website }}` |\n| `Phone Number` | Business phone number    | `{{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Phone }}`   |\n| `Email`        | Email found by ChatGPT   | `{{ $json.message.content }}`              |\n| `URL`          | Google Maps listing link | `{{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.URL }}`     |\n\n🧠 Reminder: we’re keeping only clean, usable data — ready to be exported, analyzed, or used in cold outreach campaigns (email, CRM, enrichment, etc.).\n\n➡️ And the best part? You can rerun this workflow automatically every week or month to keep collecting fresh leads 🔁.\n\n## Need Help Building an Automated Lead Generation System?\n\nThis workflow is a solid foundation for **scraping Google Maps and extracting contact emails automatically**. If you want to go further with **AI-powered lead qualification, multi-channel outreach, and automatic follow-ups**, our agency builds custom lead generation systems that run 24/7.\n\n👉 **Explore our lead generation automation services**: [Vision IA – Automated Lead Generation Agency](https://visionia.io/agence-automatisation-generation-leads)\n\nWe help B2B companies and agencies scale their prospecting without hiring more people—everything from data collection to booking qualified meetings happens on autopilot.\n\nQuestions about this workflow or other automation solutions?
