  "description": "## Overview\n\nResearchers and academic institutions need efficient ways to process and analyze large volumes of research papers and academic documents, including scanned PDFs and image-based materials (JPG, PNG). Manual review of academic literature is time-consuming and makes it difficult to identify trends, track citations, and synthesize findings across multiple papers. This workflow automates the extraction and analysis of research papers and scanned documents using OCR technology, creating a searchable knowledge base of academic insights from both digital and image-based sources.\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n- Extract key information from research papers automatically, including methodologies, findings, and citations\n- Build a searchable database of academic insights from both digital and image-based sources\n- Track citations and identify research trends across multiple papers\n- Synthesize findings from large volumes of academic literature efficiently\n\n## Who It's For\n\nResearch institutions, university libraries, R&D departments, academic researchers, literature review teams, and organizations tracking scientific developments in their field.\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nLiterature reviews require reading hundreds of papers to identify relevant findings and methodologies. This template automates the extraction of key information from research papers, including methodologies, findings, and citations. It builds a searchable database that helps researchers quickly find relevant studies and identify research gaps.\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Install the PDF Vector community node with academic features\n2. Configure PDF Vector API with academic search enabled\n3. Configure Google Drive credentials for document access\n4. Set up database for storing extracted research data\n5. Configure citation tracking preferences\n6. Set up automated paper ingestion from sources\n7. Configure summary generation parameters\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Google Drive integration for research paper retrieval (PDFs, JPGs, PNGs)\n- OCR processing for scanned documents and images\n- Automatic extraction of paper metadata and structure from any format\n- Methodology and findings summarization from PDFs and images\n- Citation network analysis and metrics\n- Multi-paper trend identification\n- Searchable research database creation\n- Integration with academic search engines\n\n**Customization Options:**\n- Add field-specific extraction templates\n- Configure automated paper discovery from arXiv, PubMed, etc.\n- Implement citation alert systems\n- Create research trend visualizations\n- Add collaboration features for research teams\n- Build API endpoints for research queries\n- Integrate with reference management tools\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nThe workflow uses PDF Vector's academic features to understand research paper structure and extract meaningful insights. It processes papers from various sources, identifies key contributions, and creates structured summaries. The system tracks citations to measure impact and identifies emerging research trends by analyzing multiple papers in a field.\n\n**Note:** This workflow uses the PDF Vector community node. Make sure to install it from the n8n community nodes collection before using this template.",
