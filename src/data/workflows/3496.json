The workflow takes a user-provided prompt as input and uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to refine and improve the prompt. The optimized prompt is then sent back to the user, ready for use in further workflows or processes.\n\n## Setup:\n1. This workflow is suitable for users who want to improve their prompts for better communication and understanding in their workflows.\n2. The workflow utilizes an AI Agent powered by an OpenAI Chat Model to enhance user prompts.\n\n## Expected Outcomes:\n- Users can provide vague or imprecise prompts as input to the workflow.\n- The AI Agent will refine and optimize the prompt, adding clarity and specific details.\n- The optimized prompt will be delivered back to the user via Telegram or can be input for the next nodes.\n\n## Extra Information:\nA. A Telegram node is used to deliver the optimized prompt back to the user.\nB. Ensure you have the necessary credentials set up for Telegram and OpenAI accounts.\nC. Customize the workflow's settings, such as the AI model used for prompt optimization, to suit your requirements.\nD. Activate the workflow once all configurations are set to start optimizing prompts efficiently.\n",
