This workflow allows businesses to automate the extraction of GST data and directly generate formatted reports in Google Docs, making compliance easier.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Node-by-Node Explanation\n\n### On form submission  \nTriggers the automation whenever a user submits the GST-related data (like GSTIN) via a web form. It collects all necessary input for further processing in the workflow.\n\n### Fetch GST Data Using GST Insights API  \nSends a request to the **[GST Insights API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights)** to fetch GST data based on the user's input. This is done via a POST request that includes the required authentication and the inputted GSTIN.\n\n### Data Reformatting  \nThis node processes and structures the raw [**GST data received from the API**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights). The reformatting ensures only the essential information (e.g., tax summaries, payment status, etc.) is extracted for reporting.\n\n### Google Docs Reporting  \nGenerates a Google Docs document and auto-populates it with the reformatted GST data. The report is structured in a clean format, ready for sharing or downloading.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Use Cases\n\n- **Tax Consultants & Agencies:** Automate the GST insights and reporting process for clients by extracting key metrics directly from the GST Insights API.  \n- **Accountants & Auditors:** Streamline GST compliance by generating automated reports based on the most current data from the API.  \n- **E-commerce Platforms:** Automatically track GST payments, returns, and summaries for each sale and consolidate them into structured reports.  \n- **SMEs and Startups:** Track your GST status and compliance without the need for manual intervention. Generate reports directly within Google Docs for easy access.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Benefits of this Workflow\n\n- **Automated GST Data Collection:** Fetch GST insights directly using the [**GST Insights API**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights) without manually searching through different resources.  \n- **Google Docs Integration:** Automatically generate customized Google Docs reports with detailed GST data, making the reporting process efficient.  \n- **Error-Free Data Analysis:** Automates data extraction and reporting, significantly reducing the risk of human errors.  \n- **Customizable Reporting:** Customize the flow for various GST-related data such as payments, returns, and summaries.  \n- **Centralized Document Storage:** All GST reports are saved and managed within Google Docs, ensuring easy collaboration and access.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Note:\nThe [**GST Insights API**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights) provides detailed GST data analysis for Indian businesses. It can extract crucial data like returns, payments, and summaries directly from the GST system, which you can then use for compliance and reporting.\n\nWould you like to explore the API further or need help with other integrations?\n\n## 🔑 How to Get Your API Key for **GST Insights API**\n\n1. **Visit the API Page:**  \n   Go to the [**GST Insights API**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights) on RapidAPI.\n\n2. **Sign Up/Login:**  \n   Create an account or log in if you already have one.\n\n3. **Subscribe to the API:**  \n   Click **\"Subscribe to Test\"** and choose a plan (free or paid).\n\n4. **Copy Your API Key:**  \n   After subscribing, your **API Key** will be available in the **\"X-RapidAPI-Key\"** section under \"Endpoints\".\n\n5. **Use the Key:**  \n   Include the key in your API requests like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   -H \"X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\"\n",
