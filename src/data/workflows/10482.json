It pairs with an [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f97a1f2ad52648e5998caf321a482890) that leverages **Apple’s on-device transcription** from the Voice Memos app and optionally passes the output to **ChatGPT or a local AI model** for summarization.\n\n### Who it's for\n\n- Anyone who wants fast, secure note capture on iOS\n- Professionals (e.g., lawyers, therapists) who require **on-device processing** for privacy\n- Obsidian users who want to sync mobile notes via Google Drive\n\n### What it does\n\n1. You record a voice memo in the iOS Voice Memos app.\n2. The Shortcut transcribes it locally (no API or cloud involved).\n3. Optionally, a summarization step is done via ChatGPT or a replaceable local model.\n4. The data is sent to an n8n webhook, where it’s converted into a `.md` file.\n5. The Markdown file is uploaded to a Google Drive folder synced with your Obsidian vault.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n- 🧠 Keeps your meeting notes private — no cloud APIs required\n- 🗃️ Easily searchable in Obsidian as structured Markdown files\n- 🛠️ Fully local if you swap out ChatGPT for a local model (can be less stable)\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Transcriptions longer than **~1 hour** may fail or produce unstable results.\n- Some setup required to replace ChatGPT with a local model in the Shortcut.\n\n### Setup\n\n- Install and configure the [iOS Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f97a1f2ad52648e5998caf321a482890)\n- Replace the ChatGPT step in the Shortcut if you need full local-only processing\n- Point the webhook in the Shortcut to your n8n instance\n- Make sure your Obsidian vault is synced with the Google Drive folder used in the workflow\n- Update any of the prompts in the iOS shortcut to ensure its personalized. \n\n&gt; ⚡ Pro Tip: Use a Set node early on to clearly define the `filename`, `title`, and `text` so it's easier to modify this for other note types (e.g., journals, therapy sessions, etc.)\n",
