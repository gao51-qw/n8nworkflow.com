  "description": "# Generate daily audio newsletters from news headlines with AI\n\n## Who's it for\n\nPerfect for **content creators, podcasters, news enthusiasts, and busy professionals** who want to create automated audio news content or stay informed through personalized audio briefings. Ideal for social media managers, newsletter creators, and anyone building audio-first content experiences.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow creates a fully automated news-to-audio pipeline:\n\n1. **Schedule trigger** fetches the latest news headlines from NewsAPI daily\n2. **AI processing** rewrites each article into newsletter-style content using Claude\n3. **Content aggregation** combines all processed articles into a cohesive newsletter\n4. **Script generation** transforms the newsletter into a 2-minute audio-ready script\n5. **Text-to-speech** converts the script into high-quality audio using OpenAI's voice models\n6. **Email delivery** sends the audio newsletter as an attachment to subscribers\n\nThe workflow runs automatically on your chosen schedule, delivering fresh audio content without any manual intervention.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **NewsAPI account** with API key (free tier available)\n- **OpenRouter API access** for Claude model\n- **OpenAI API account** for text-to-speech functionality\n- **Gmail account** with OAuth2 access for email delivery\n- **Basic understanding** of audio file handling (optional)\n\n### Step-by-step setup\n**1. Set Your Schedule trigger**\n- Configure the Schedule Trigger for your preferred timing (daily at 7 AM recommended)\n- Consider your audience timezone and optimal delivery times\n- Set up monitoring to ensure consistent execution\n\n**2. Configure News Source**\n- Sign up for NewsAPI at newsapi.org (free tier includes 100 requests/day)\n- Replace `YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY` with your actual API key in the HTTP Request node\n- Customize the news query parameters (country, category, sources) to match your audience interests\n- Test the API endpoint to ensure it returns expected data\n\n**3. Extract Individual Articles(Split Out)**\n- Takes the articles array from NewsAPI response\n- Creates separate items for each news article\n- Enables individual processing of each story\n- Prepares data for AI content generation\n\n**4. Set Up AI Model Credentials**\n- Create an OpenRouter account for Claude access\n- Add your OpenRouter API credentials in n8n\n- Alternatively, replace with OpenAI GPT-4 if you prefer (update the model node accordingly)\n- Configure rate limits and usage monitoring\n\n**5. Combine Newsletter Content\" (Aggregate)**\n- Collects output from all processed articles\n- Renames field to news for easy reference\n- Prepares combined content for script generation\n- Ensures no articles are lost in processing\n\n**6. Audio Script Generation**\n - GPT-4 creates 2-minute audio-ready script from newsletter content.\n - Creates script with \"Max\" presenter persona\n###### Script features:\n   - 2-minute target duration\n   - Audio-friendly text (no special characters)\n   - Natural speaking flow and transitions\n   - Engaging introduction and conclusion\n\n**7. Configure OpenAI Text-to-Speech**\n- Add your OpenAI API credentials in n8n\n- Choose your preferred voice model (options: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)\n- Set audio quality preferences (standard vs HD)\n- Test voice output with sample text\n\n**8. Customize Email Delivery**\n- Add your Gmail OAuth2 credentials\n- Replace `YOUR_EMAIL@example.com` with your actual recipient email\n- Update the sender name and business information in email template\n- Configure attachment settings for audio files\n\n**9. Test the Complete Pipeline**\n- Run a manual execution to test all components\n- Verify news data is properly fetched and processed\n- Check audio quality and duration\n- Confirm email delivery with audio attachment\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Advanced News Filtering\n- **Custom sources**: Replace NewsAPI with RSS feeds from specific publications\n- **Topic filtering**: Add keyword filtering to focus on specific industries or topics\n- **Multi-country support**: Fetch news from multiple regions and merge content\n- **Sentiment analysis**: Filter out negative news or categorize by sentiment\n- **Trending topics**: Integrate with social media APIs to include trending discussions\n\n### AI Content Enhancement\n- **Voice persona**: Customize the AI prompt to create different presenter personalities (professional, casual, expert)\n- **Length control**: Adjust script length for different formats (1-minute updates, 5-minute deep dives)\n- **Multi-language support**: Generate newsletters in different languages based on subscriber preferences\n- **Fact-checking**: Add verification steps to ensure accuracy of AI-generated content\n- **Source attribution**: Include proper citations and links to original articles\n\n### Audio Production Features\n- **Voice variety**: Rotate between different OpenAI voices for engaging content\n- **Background music**: Add intro/outro music using audio editing APIs\n- **Speed control**: Adjust playback speed based on content type\n- **Chapter markers**: Add timestamps for different news segments\n- **Quality optimization**: Implement audio normalization and enhancement\n\n### Distribution Enhancements\n- **Multi-channel delivery**: Send to Slack, Discord, or team communication platforms\n- **Podcast publishing**: Automatically upload to podcast platforms via RSS\n- **Social media**: Post audio clips to Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram\n- **Website integration**: Embed audio player on your website automatically\n- **Mobile app push**: Send notifications to mobile apps with audio links\n\n### Subscriber Management\n- **Mailchimp integration**: Build and manage subscriber lists automatically\n- **Preference tracking**: Allow subscribers to choose news categories or frequency\n- **Analytics tracking**: Monitor open rates, listening duration, and engagement\n- **A/B testing**: Test different voice styles, content lengths, or delivery times\n- **Segmentation**: Send different newsletters to different subscriber segments\n\n### Content Workflow Customization\n- **Editorial review**: Add approval steps before content distribution\n- **Content calendar**: Integrate with planning tools for scheduled content themes\n- **Collaborative editing**: Include team review processes for content quality\n- **Version control**: Maintain archives of previous newsletters for reference\n- **Performance metrics**: Track which content types perform best\n\n## Webhook Integration Examples\n\n### Website Integration\n```javascript\n// Add this to your website for manual newsletter requests\nfetch('/webhook/trigger-newsletter', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    subscriber_email: 'user@example.com',\n    topics: ['technology', 'business'],\n    urgency: 'normal'\n  })\n});\n```\n\n### Slack Command Integration\n- Create slash commands to trigger newsletter generation on demand\n- Allow team members to request specific topic newsletters\n- Integrate with Slack workflows for automated team briefings\n\n### Mobile App Integration\n- Use webhooks to trigger newsletters from mobile app interactions\n- Create push notification systems for breaking news alerts\n- Build in-app audio players for seamless listening experience\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n**NewsAPI quota exceeded:**\n- Monitor your daily API usage in NewsAPI dashboard\n- Implement caching to

to text-only newsletters when audio fails\n\n**Email delivery problems:**\n- Verify Gmail API quotas and sending limits\n- Check audio file size limits (Gmail has 25MB attachment limit)\n- Implement compression for large audio files\n- Consider cloud storage links instead of direct attachments\n\n**Content quality issues:**\n- Fine-tune AI prompts for more consistent output\n- Add content validation steps to check for accuracy\n- Implement editorial guidelines in AI instructions\n- Create feedback loops to improve content over time\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n**Workflow efficiency:**\n- Process news articles in parallel where possible\n- Implement smart caching for repeated content\n- Optimize API calls to reduce latency\n- Monitor execution times and identify bottlenecks\n\n**Cost management:**\n- Track API costs across all services (NewsAPI, OpenRouter, OpenAI)\n- Implement budget alerts and automatic shutoffs\n- Optimize content length to reduce text-to-speech costs\n- Consider batch processing during off-peak hours\n\n**Scalability preparation:**\n- Design for multiple subscriber support\n- Plan for increased news volume during major
