  "description": "# 🔄 Daily Follow-Up System with Multi-Stage Sequences\n\n## What It Does\nAutomatically sends timed follow-up emails to leads based on a 4-stage sequence (Day 1, 3, 7, 14), updates tracking automatically, and calculates next follow-up dates. Set it once, add leads, and never manually track follow-ups again. Converts cold leads into warm opportunities through consistent, professional touchpoints.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Schedule Trigger** → Runs daily at 9 AM\n2. **Read Tracker Sheet** → Gets all leads from Follow-Up Tracker\n3. **Filter Today's Follow-Ups** → Only processes leads where \"Next Follow-Up Date\" = Today\n4. **Process Individually** → Handles each lead one at a time (prevents rate limits)\n5. **Route by Stage** → Sends appropriate email based on Day 1/3/7/14 stage\n6. **Send Stage Email** → 4 different templates for each follow-up milestone\n7. **Update Last Sent** → Records when email was sent\n8. **Calculate Next Date** → Automatically schedules next follow-up (or marks complete)\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS\n\n### Step 1: Create Follow-Up Tracker Sheet\n- Create Google Sheet with tab \"Follow-Up Tracker\"\n- Add columns: `Name | Email | Project/Interest | Timeline | Next Step | Stage | Next Follow-Up Date | Last Sent Date | Status`\n- Populate with leads: Set Stage = \"Day 1\", Status = \"Active\", Next Follow-Up Date = desired start date\n- Update `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in nodes 2, 7, and 8\n\n### Step 2: Configure Email Templates\n- Edit nodes 6-9 with your email templates\n- Replace `YOUR_CALENDAR_LINK` with your actual booking link (Calendly, etc.)\n- Replace `YOUR_RESOURCE_LINK` in Day 3 email with relevant content\n- Customize sender name/signature in all templates\n\n### Step 3: Setup Gmail Connection\n- Add Gmail OAuth2 credentials to all email nodes\n- Test workflow with one test lead first\n- Monitor Gmail sending limits (500/day for free accounts)\n\n### Step 4: Test the Sequence\n- Add one test lead with Next Follow-Up Date = today\n- Manually execute workflow to verify email sends\n- Check that Google Sheet updates correctly\n- Verify next stage is calculated properly",
