  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how to manage your Qdrant vector store when there is a need to keep it in sync with local files. It covers creating, updating and deleting vector store records ensuring our chatbot assistant is never outdated or misleading.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis workflow depends on local files accessed through the local filesystem and so will only work on a self-hosted version of n8n at this time. It is possible to amend this workflow to work on n8n cloud by replacing the local file trigger and read file nodes.\n\n## How it works\n* A local directory where bank statements are downloaded to is monitored via a local file trigger. The trigger watches for the file create, file changed and file deleted events.\n* When a file is created, its contents are uploaded to the vector store.\n* When a file is updated, its previous records are replaced.\n* When the file is deleted, the corresponding records are also removed from the vector store.\n* A simple Question and Answer Chatbot is setup to answer any questions about the bank statements in the system.\n\n## Requirements\n* A self-hosted version of n8n. Some of the nodes used in this workflow only work with the local filesystem.\n* Qdrant instance to store the records.\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nThis workflow can also work with remote data. Try integrating accounting or CRM software to build a managed system for payroll, invoices and more.\n\n## Want to go fully local?\n\nA version of this workflow is available which uses Ollama instead.
