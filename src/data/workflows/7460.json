  "description": "# Automated App Analysis & ASO Report Generator\n\nThis workflow automates the process of analyzing a mobile app from the Google Play Store and generating a professional **ASO (App Store Optimization) Report**.  \nSimply submit a Play Store URL, and the workflow will fetch app intelligence data, parse it, run an AI-based analysis, and deliver a formatted report in Google Docs. A Telegram notification with the document link ensures you never miss a new report.\n\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n- **Form Input Trigger** – Start the workflow by submitting a Play Store URL.  \n- **Automated Data Retrieval** – Uses HTTP request to fetch app intelligence (via SensorTower or similar APIs).  \n- **Smart Data Parsing** – Extracts essential app details, competitor insights, reviews, downloads, and revenue data.  \n- **AI-Powered ASO Report** – Generates a professional analysis using LLM (Gemini via OpenRouter) with structured sections:  \n  - 📱 App Overview  \n  - ⭐ User Ratings & Reviews  \n  - 📊 Competitor Analysis  \n  - 📈 Market Insights  \n  - 💡 Actionable Recommendations  \n- **Google Docs Integration** – Creates and updates a Google Doc with the generated report.  \n- **Instant Notification** – Sends a Telegram message with the app report link for quick access.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔐 Required Credentials\nTo run this workflow, you’ll need:\n- **SensorTower API (or alternative App Intelligence API)** – for app details, reviews, competitors, and market data.  \n- **OpenRouter API** – to access LLM model.  \n- **Google Docs OAuth2** – to create and update the ASO report in Google Docs.  \n- **Telegram API** – for instant notifications with the report link.  \n\n---\n\n## 🎁 Benefits\n- **Save Time** – Automates the manual process of app research and reporting.  \n- **Consistent Reporting** – Ensures every report follows a professional structure with clear sections.  \n- **Actionable Insights** – Get AI-generated recommendations to improve app performance and competitiveness.  \n- **Collaboration-Ready** – Reports are stored in Google Docs for easy sharing and editing.  \n- **Real-Time Alerts** – Stay updated via Telegram whenever a new report is generated.  \n\n---\n",
