  "description": "## Overview\n\nThis workflow finds potential customers, gathers detailed info about them and their companies, and then uses AI to research them in detail and write personalized messages for LinkedIn and a series of four cold emails. All this data is organized in Google Sheets for easy tracking and use.\n## Use Case\n\nThis tool is perfect for **salespeople, marketers, and business owners**. It saves you a lot of time by automating lead finding, research, and email writing. This helps you send many personalized messages quickly, leading to more replies and better sales.\n## How It Works\n\nYou start by telling the workflow who you want to reach (e.g., \"Marketing Agencies,\" \"New York,\" \"COOs\"). The workflow then uses **scrapers** (from Apify) to find these people on Apollo.io and LinkedIn, collecting their contact details and company information.\n\nNext, an **AI analyzes all this data**. It creates a detailed report on each company, including what they do, their strengths, recent news, and possible challenges they face. This report helps the AI then write a friendly **LinkedIn message opener** and a **4-part hyper-personalised cold email series** specifically for each person. These emails cover problems you can solve, success stories, and a clear next step. Finally, all the prospect details and generated messages are saved neatly in your Google Sheets.\n\n## How to Set It Up\n\n1.  **Scrapers:** Go to **Apify**, get your API Token from \"API & Integrations,\" and put it into the scraper nodes in the workflow.\n2.  **Google Sheets:** Copy the provided **Google Sheet template**. Then, add your email addresses to the \"Assign Sender Email\" node so the workflow can choose who sends the emails.\n3.  **AI (OpenAI):** Add your **OpenAI API Key**. In the \"About You\" node, fill in information about *your company* and *your skills* so the AI can write super relevant messages.\n4.  **Test:** Run the workflow using the \"Enter Target Audience\" form. You can set how often it runs. If you need help, check the [detailed guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m76gYhNqPUdRMBtlXlDgMrF1z2T3rf8u/view) or email `info.gainflow@gmail.com`.",
