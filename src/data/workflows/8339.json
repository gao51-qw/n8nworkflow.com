  "title": "Replace your call center with an AI agent using GoHighLevel (GHL), VAPI & Twilio",
  "description": "The **AI Calling Agent** is a fully automated phone assistant built with **n8n, GoHighLevel (GHL), VAPI, and Twilio**.  \nThis workflow allows you to:  \n- Trigger outbound calls from your CRM (GHL).  \n- Use a voice AI assistant (VAPI) to talk with leads in real time.  \n- Route calls through Twilio.  \n- Save **appointments and full conversation summaries** directly in GHL.  \n\nIt has been tested on **real warm leads** (not random numbers) and proven stable at **up to 300 calls/day without interruption**.  \nInstead of manually calling and qualifying each lead, let the agent do it automatically and focus only on booked calls.  \n\n---\n\n## Workflow in Action  \n\n#### Appointment booking  \n- The agent can confirm appointments and save them directly in your GHL calendar, along with the summary of the conversation.  \n\n![GHL Appointment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent/refs/heads/main/GHL%20appointment.png)  \n\n#### Agent performance  \n- You can monitor conversations, call logs, and outcomes directly in the VAPI dashboard.  \n\n![VAPI Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent/refs/heads/main/vapi%20dashboard.png)  \n\n#### Agent working live  \n- Proof that the agent can run **non-stop for hundreds of calls per day** without errors or interruptions.  \n- Demonstrates reliability and stability even under continuous execution.  \n\n![Agent in Action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent/refs/heads/main/Agent%20working.png)  \n\n#### Contact statuses  \n- Each contact in GHL receives a status tag depending on the call result: **answered**, **invalid number**, **no response**, etc. This ensures your pipeline stays clean and updated automatically.  \n\n![GHL Status Tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent/refs/heads/main/GHL%20tag-VAPI.png)  \n\n#### The brain of the agent  \n- Inside VAPI, every assistant is powered by a **command system (the brain)** where you define how it should behave during calls.  \n- In this case, the brain is **propelled by OpenAI**, but VAPI also supports a wide range of AI models such as **Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, LLaMA** and more.  \n- The same flexibility applies to voices: you can instantly switch between integrated providers like **ElevenLabs, Play.ht, Microsoft Azure Voices, Google Cloud TTS**, and others.  \n- This makes the agent not only smart but also highly customizable - from the intelligence driving the conversation to the exact voice your clients will hear.  \n\n![Agent Brain – VAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent/refs/heads/main/VAPI%20promt%20model.png)   \n\n---\n\n## Required APIs  \n\nTo run this workflow, you need the following:  \n- **VAPI API key** → for the voice AI assistant logic.  \n- **Twilio API key** → to provide phone numbers and route calls.  \n- **GoHighLevel (GHL) API key** → to manage contacts, pipelines, and save appointments.  \n \n---\n\n## Setup Steps  \n\n1. **Generate API keys** for VAPI, Twilio, and GHL.  \n2. **Import the n8n template** into your environment.  \n3. **Configure credentials** in n8n for each API.  \n4. Set your **trigger conditions in GHL** (e.g., pipeline stage changes, new leads).  \n5. Test the workflow with a warm lead before scaling.  \n6. (Optional) Adjust logging or sync results with Google Sheets/Notion.  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Use Cases  \n\n- **Sales Teams**: Automatically call new inbound leads, qualify them, and book appointments.  \n- **Agencies**: Replace repetitive cold calling with an automated assistant, then hand over only the hot leads to human agents.  \n- **Real Estate**: Pre-qualify potential buyers or renters, schedule viewings, and save results in GHL.  \n- **Healthcare/Clinics**: Confirm appointments, send reminders, and reduce no-shows with an AI calling agent.  \n- **Education/Coaching**: Handle inquiries for courses, book consultations, and sync data with your CRM.  \n- **Inbound Calls**: The agent can also be configured to **answer incoming phone calls**, providing information, capturing lead details, or routing the caller to the right person.    \n\n---\n\n With this template, you get a **scalable AI-powered sales assistant** that saves hours of manual calling while ensuring every lead gets a fast, professional response.\n\n---\n\n# Links\n- [📂 GitHub](https://github.com/TuguiDragos/ghl-n8n-ai-calling-agent)  \n- [📰 Medium Article](https://medium.com/@tuguidragos/meet-your-new-ai-phone-assistant-the-automated-call-agent-with-a-human-touch-296fb90b9429)  \n- [▶️ YouTube Lite Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgDPP_hJ7ms) – *simplified version using Google Sheets only*",
