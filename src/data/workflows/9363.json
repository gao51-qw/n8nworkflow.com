  "description": "This workflow turns any **Telegram bot** into an AI-powered **social media command center** for photos, videos and voice notes.\n\n[video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5WndRCD63I)\n\nFrom one Telegram chat you can:\n\n- Send a **photo** and auto-post it to **Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest** with AI captions.\n- Send a **video** and:\n  - Let AI generate **titles + descriptions** and upload it to **TikTok, Instagram and YouTube**.\n  - Use `/thumb` to generate **4 custom thumbnails** with **Nano Banana Pro**.\n  - Use `/edit ...` to run **FFmpeg edits** (cut, mute, resize, speed, etc.) via **Upload-Post FFmpeg jobs** and get the edited video back in Telegram.\n- Send a **voice note** and turn it into posts for **LinkedIn, X (Twitter) and Threads**, then auto-publish.\n- Keep **human approval** in the loop: every caption or text post is shown in Telegram for you to accept before publishing.\n\nOut of the box, the captions and long descriptions are optimized for **Spanish (es-ES)**, but you can easily change the prompts to any language or brand voice.\n\n---\n\n## What You Can Do From Telegram\n\n### 1. Photo → Instagram, TikTok & Pinterest\n\nJust send a **photo** (or image as document) to your Telegram bot:\n\n- The workflow downloads the photo from Telegram.\n- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** analyzes the image plus your caption/text (if any).\n- An AI Agent generates **platform-specific descriptions** for:\n  - TikTok (short hook, 90 chars)\n  - Instagram\n  - Pinterest (title + description)\n- You receive a message in Telegram with all the proposed descriptions.\n- You approve or reject with inline buttons.\n- On approval, **Upload-Post** publishes the photo to:\n  - Instagram\n  - TikTok\n  - Pinterest (to the board you configured)  \n  and sends back a status message with success flags, post URLs and error messages.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Video → TikTok, Instagram & YouTube (no commands)\n\nIf you send a **video with no special caption**:\n\n- The workflow treats it as a standard **video post**.\n- It fetches the file from Telegram.\n- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** analyzes the video and describes its content.\n- An AI Agent turns that description + your caption into:\n  - TikTok description\n  - Instagram description\n  - YouTube **title + description**\n- You get a Telegram message with the three platform descriptions to review.\n- Once you approve:\n  - It shows “Uploading…” in Telegram.\n  - The video is sent to **Upload-Post**, which uploads to **TikTok, Instagram and YouTube** with the generated text.\n  - Finally, you receive an upload report for each platform (success, URL, error message).\n\n---\n\n### 3. `/thumb` → AI Thumbnails for Your Video (Nano Banana Pro)\n\nIf you send a **video with caption exactly `/thumb`**:\n\n- The workflow downloads the video.\n- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** generates a **long, SEO-rich description in Spanish** of everything that happens in the video.\n- A second AI Agent uses that detailed description to create **3 concepts**:\n  - Each concept has: `title`, `description`, and a full `prompt_thumbnail` (Spanish, single line) specially crafted for **Nano Banana Pro**.\n- In Telegram you see the 3 concepts (titles) and select:\n  - `0`, `1`, `2` or “create new”.\n- Once you choose a concept:\n  - The prompt is sent to **Nano Banana Pro** (`fal-ai/nano-banana-pro/edit`) with your reference face image (configurable).\n  - Nano Banana Pro generates **4 thumbnails** (16:9).\n  - The workflow downloads the 4 images and sends them back to you in Telegram as photos so you can pick and use your favorite in your YouTube/Upload-Post pipeline.\n\nUse `/thumb` whenever you already have the video and just want **killer thumbnails** generated with AI.\n\n---\n\n### 4. `/edit …` → Natural-Language FFmpeg Video Editor\n\nIf you send a **video with a caption starting with `/edit`**, for example:\n\n- `/edit cut the first 3 seconds and remove the audio`\n- `/edit crop to vertical 9:16 and speed up x1.5`\n- `/edit blur the background and keep the subject centered`\n\nThe workflow behaves as a **text-to-FFmpeg command generator**:\n\n- An AI Agent (powered by **Gemini**) reads your `/edit` instructions.\n- It generates a **safe FFmpeg command** in JSON format:\n  - Always uses `ffmpeg -y`\n  - Uses `{input}` and `{output}` placeholders\n  - No semicolons and no dangerous shell characters\n- The workflow then:\n  - Downloads the original video from Telegram.\n  - Calls **Upload-Post FFmpeg jobs API** with the video and the generated `full_command`.\n  - Polls the job status until it’s finished.\n  - Downloads the processed (edited) video.\n  - Sends the edited video back to you in Telegram with a simple `sendVideo` node.\n\nThis makes Telegram a **front-end for a remote FFmpeg engine**: you describe the edit in natural language, and the workflow handles all the FFmpeg complexity.\n\n&gt; Note: The edited video is returned to Telegram; if you want to auto-post it, simply send the new video again **without `/edit`** so it goes through the normal multi-platform publishing path.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Voice Notes → LinkedIn, X & Threads (Text Posts)\n\nFor **voice messages**:\n\n- The Telegram Trigger detects `message.voice`.\n- The workflow downloads the audio file.\n- **OpenAI Whisper** transcribes the recording.\n- An AI Agent turns the transcription into:\n  - A **LinkedIn post** (Spanish, long-form dev/creator style, based on your examples).\n  - A **Threads post** (Spanish, up to ~500 chars).\n  - A **Tweet / X post or thread** (English, using hooks + hashtags like `#n8n`, `#automation`, `#dev`).\n- In Telegram you see a preview message with the suggested copy for Threads, LinkedIn and X.\n- After you approve:\n  - You get an “Uploading…” message.\n  - **Upload-Post** publishes:\n    - To your LinkedIn organization page (configured by ID).\n    - To X (Twitter).\n    - To Threads.\n  - The workflow sends a status message with success flags and URLs for each platform.\n\nThis is perfect for **“talk to your phone, ship content to all your text platforms”**.\n\n---\n\n## How the Workflow Is Structured\n\n- **Telegram Trigger**  \n  Listens to every incoming message and routes by type:\n  - `/start` → No-Op\n  - `voice` → Audio pipeline\n  - `document/photo` → Photo pipeline\n  - `video` → Video/thumbnail/editor pipelines (`/thumb`, `/edit` or normal)\n\n- **AI Blocks (Gemini + OpenAI)**  \n  - Gemini 2.5 Flash for:\n    - Photo understanding.\n    - Short video descriptions (for auto-posting).\n    - Long, detailed video summaries (for thumbnail generator).\n  - OpenAI Whisper for voice transcription.\n  - Multiple AI Agents (Gemini chat) with **structured JSON output parsers** for:\n    - Per-platform social captions.\n    - Threads/LinkedIn/X posts.\n    - Thumbnail prompts and title concepts.\n    - FFmpeg command generation.\n\n- **Upload-Post Integration**\n  - **Photos** → Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest.\n  - **Videos** → TikTok, Instagram, YouTube.\n  - **Text** → LinkedIn page, X, Threads.\n  - FFmpeg job endpoint for server-side video editing.\n  - All uploads return **status, URL and error messages** back into Telegram.\n\n- **Human-in-the-Loop**\n  - All critical AI outputs go through `sendAndWait` nodes in Telegram:\n    - You review and choose whether to publish or not.\n    - You choose which thumbnail concept to use.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements & Setup\n\n- **Accounts & APIs**\n  - Telegram bot (via @BotFather).\n  - **Upload-Post.com** account with your social profiles connected.\n  - **OpenAI API key** (Whisper).\n  - **Google Gemini API key** (AI Studio).\n  - **Nano Banana Pro / fal.ai** key (for thumbnails).\n\n- **Runtime**\n  - n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).\n  - FFmpeg available where n8n runs (Docker image, VM, etc.) for local checks if needed (the heavy lifting is delegated to Upload-Post FFmpeg jobs).\n\n- **Configuration**\n  - Create Telegram credentials with your bot token.\n  - Create Upload-Post credentials with your API token.\n  - Set `upload_post_user` and `pinterest_board_id` in the `Edit Fields` node.\n  - Optionally replace:\n    - Example face image URL used for Nano Banana Pro.\n    - LinkedIn organization ID.\n    - Any language / tone in the AI agent system prompts.\n\n---\n\n## Ideal Use Cases\n\n- **Creators & influencers** who want to post to every platform from **one Telegram chat**.\n- **Agencies** who want a “content butler” clients can use without touching n8n.\n- **Solo devs & makers** who publish workflows, devlogs and product updates and want:\n  - Multi-platform video posts.\n  - Voice → LinkedIn/X/Threads posts.\n  - Easy text-based video editing and thumbnail generation.\n\nInstall this template, plug in your keys, talk to your bot in Telegram, and turn it into your **all-in-one AI social media machine**.\n",
