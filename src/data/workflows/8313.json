  "description": "\n![Screenshot 20250915 at 11.37.26.png](fileId:2631)\n\n**Why skim 10-K/10-Q by hand when AI can extract what matters in minutes?**\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nSales engineers, solution architects, founders, product/strategy teams, analysts, and BD reps who need fast, consistent briefs on public companies—plus a mapping to a chosen vendor’s solutions.\n\n### Use case\n\n- **Problem:** SEC filings are dense. Manually summarizing financials, spotting initiatives, and aligning them to a vendor’s offerings is slow, error-prone, and often missed by busy teams.\n- **Use Case:** An n8n workflow that takes a company name / URL / ticker, analyzes the latest 10-Q/10-K with Perplexity “Deep Research” (via OpenRouter), extracts a concise financial overview and top 4–5 initiatives (tech, cost, revenue), then maps them to one vendor’s solutions (e.g., Microsoft, Google, T-Mobile) and outputs a clean brief.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n1. **Trigger:** “When chat message received” (or webhook) accepts name / URL / ticker + target vendor.\n\n2. **AI Agent:**\n\n\t- Chat Model (OpenRouter) orchestrates the prompt and formatting.\n\n\t- Tool: Perplexity Deep Research performs retrieval over the latest 10-K/10-Q and recent references.\n\n3. **Output:** Creates a Google Drive document from the generated text (title, summary, initiatives, vendor-solution matches, suggested contacts).\n\n- **(Optional)** Append a row to Google Sheets for tracking companies, initiatives, and match scores.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- n8n (Cloud or self-hosted).\n\n- Credentials in n8n:\n\n\t- OpenRouter API key (with access to Perplexity’s Deep Research model).\n\n\t- Google Drive (and Google Sheets, if you add the sheet step).\n\n### Setup\n\n- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.\n\n- Open Credentials → connect OpenRouter and Google Drive.\n\n- In the AI Agent node:\n\n\t-\tSet Chat Model to your OpenRouter model.\n\n\t- Set Tool to Perplexity’s Deep Research endpoint.\n\n\t-\tPaste the provided prompt that(example):\n\n###### Summarize the key financial highlights and list the key strategic initiatives from Office Depot's most recent quarterly report. The company's URL is https://www.officedepot.com and its stock symbol is ODP.\n\n###### After gathering this information, compare Office Depot's initiatives with the solutions offered by T-Mobile for Business (URL: https://www.t-mobile.com/business, stock symbol: TMUS). Finally, provide specific recommendations on T-Mobile solutions that can help Office Depot achieve its initiatives. \n\n###### Explain how each recommended solution would help. Present the final response with clear headings for each section.\n\n\n###  How to customize it for your needs\n\n- **Ticker/Name disambiguation:** Add a guardrail step that confirms the exchange + CIK before analysis.\n\n- **EDGAR fetch (advanced):** Pull the exact 10-K/10-Q document/link and pass it to the model for grounded citations.\n\n- **Multi-vendor mapping:** Loop over a list (e.g., Microsoft, Google Cloud, AWS) and produce a comparison table.\n\n- **Contact enrichment:** Add your preferred enrichment step to suggest roles (IT, Network, Data, Finance).\n\n- **Scoring:** Compute initiative ↔ solution fit scores and prioritize must-explore actions.\n\n- **Alerts:** Send the brief to Slack/Telegram/Email for your team.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- Wrong company matched? Add a pre-check that resolves ticker → legal name and require confirmation.\n\n- Generic web summary? Tighten the prompt: “Use the latest 10-Q/10-K; cite sections; list initiatives with evidence.”\n\n- Empty Drive file? Verify the AI Agent’s {{$json}} mappings flow into the Drive node’s content.\n\n\n\n- No citations? Require bullet-level references; if missing, loop once with a “citations-only” follow-up prompt.\n\n### Why Use This Template?\n\nTurn hours of filing review into a repeatable, shareable brief. You’ll get:\n\n- A clean financial snapshot,\n\n- The company’s top initiatives,\n\n- A vendor-aligned solution map you can act on immediately—great for prospecting, QBRs, and strategic planning.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n![Screenshot 20250908 at 12.34.15.png](fileId:2324)\n\n\n### Need Assistance?\n\nFor setup guidance, customization, or business inquiries,\nEmail: phoenixaiagentsolutions@gmail.com",
