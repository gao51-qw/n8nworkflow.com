  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## How it works\n\nThis automated workflow monitors stock prices by scraping real-time data from Yahoo Finance. It uses a scheduled trigger to run at specified intervals, extracts key stock metrics using AI-powered extraction, formats the data through a custom code node, and automatically saves the structured information to Google Sheets for tracking and analysis.\n\n## Key Steps:\n- **Scheduled Trigger**: Runs automatically at specified intervals to collect fresh stock data\n- **AI-Powered Scraping**: Uses ScrapeGraphAI to intelligently extract stock information (symbol, current price, price change, change percentage, volume, and market cap) from Yahoo Finance\n- **Data Processing**: Formats extracted data through a custom Code node for optimal spreadsheet compatibility and handles both single and multiple stock formats\n- **Automated Storage**: Saves all stock data to Google Sheets with proper column mapping for easy filtering, analysis, and historical tracking\n\n# Set up steps\n\n**Setup Time: 5-10 minutes**\n\n1. **Configure Credentials**: Set up your ScrapeGraphAI API key and Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials\n2. **Customize Target**: Update the website URL in the ScrapeGraphAI node to your desired stock symbol (currently set to AAPL)\n3. **Configure Schedule**: Set your preferred trigger frequency (daily, hourly, etc.) for stock price monitoring\n4. **Map Spreadsheet**: Connect to your Google Sheets document and configure column mapping for the stock data fields\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Keep detailed configuration notes in the sticky notes within the workflow\n- Test with a single stock first before scaling to multiple stocks\n- Consider modifying the Code node to handle different stock symbols or add additional data fields\n- Perfect for building a historical database of stock performance over time\n- Can be extended to track multiple stocks by modifying the ScrapeGraphAI prompt\n",
