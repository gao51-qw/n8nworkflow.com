  "description": "# Send daily applicant digest by role from Gmail to hiring managers with Google Gemini\n\nThis workflow automatically collects all new job application emails from your Gmail labeled as **applicants** in the last 24 hours. Every day at 6:00 PM (Asia/Kolkata), it extracts structured details (name, email, phone, role, experience, skills, location, notice, summary) from each applicant (using Gemini AI or OpenAI). It then groups applicants by role and manager, compiles a neat HTML table digest for each manager and emails them a single summary — so hiring managers get everything they need, at a glance, in one place.\n\n## Who’s It For\n\n- Recruiters and hiring managers tired of digging through multiple application threads.\n- Small HR teams / agencies not yet on a full applicant tracking system.\n- Anyone wanting a consolidated, role-targeted applicant update each day.\n- Teams that want to automate candidate triage using Google Workspace and AI.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger (6PM IST):** Runs automatically at 18:00 India time.\n2. **Fetch Applicant Emails:** Reads Gmail for emails labeled 'applicants' from the past 24 hours.\n3. **Prepare Email Text:** Converts email content to plain text for reliable AI extraction.\n4. **Extract Applicant Details:** Gemini/OpenAI extracts applicant’s info in structured JSON.\n5. **Assign Manager Emails:** Routes each applicant to the correct manager via role→email mapping or fallback.\n6. **Group & Build HTML Tables:** Organizes applicants by manager and role, builds summary tables.\n7. **Send Digest to Managers:** Sends each manager one HTML summary email for their new applicants.\n\n## How to Set Up\n\n1. **Create/verify Gmail label** `applicants` and set up filters to route job emails there.\n2. **Import the workflow:** Use your Google/Gmail and Gemini/OpenAI accounts as credentials.\n3. **Configure connections:**\n\t- Gmail with OAuth2 (IMAP not required, uses Gmail API)\n\t- Gemini or OpenAI API key for extraction\n4. **Set role→manager** mapping in the “Assign Manager Emails” node (just edit the map!).\n5. **Adjust time / defaults:** Edit schedule and fallback email if you wish.\n6. **Test it:** Send yourself a test application, label it, check workflow logs.\n\n## Requirements\t\n\n- Gmail account (with OAuth2 enabled and 'applicants' label set up)\n- Gemini or OpenAI API key for structured AI extraction\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- SMTP credentials (if using direct email instead of Gmail node)\n- At least one valid hiring manager email mapped to a role\n\n## How to Customize the Workflow\n\n- Centralize config with a **Set node** (label name, fallback/manager email, model name, schedule).\n- Add attachment-to-text conversion for applications with resume attachments.\n- Normalize role names in the mapping code for more robust routing.\n- Enable additional delivery: Slack, Teams, Google Sheets log, extra Cron for mid-day urgents.\n- Refine AI extraction prompt for specific fields (add portfolio URL, etc.).\n- Change schedule for daily, weekly or per-role timing.\n\n## Add‑Ons / Extensions\n\n- **Resume Text Extraction:** Add PDF/DOCX to text parsing for attachment-only applications.\n- **ChatOps:** Send the summary to Slack or Teams channels along with/instead of email.\n- **Applicant Logging:** Auto-log every applicant/action into Google Sheets, Notion or Airtable.\n- **Multi-timezone:** Duplicate/modify the Cron trigger for different manager regions or urgency levels.\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n- **Tech Hiring:** Java, Python, Frontend candidates are automatically routed to their respective leads.\n- **Small Agency:** All applications summarized for reviewers, with per-role breakdowns.\n- **HR Operations:** Daily rollups sent before hiring sync, facilitating fast decision-making.\n\n## Common Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No emails processed | No 'applicants' label or wrong time window | Check Gmail filters and adjust search query in fetch node |\n| All digests go to fallback manager | Incorrect or missing role → manager mapping | Normalize role text in assignment node, expand map |\n| AI Extraction returns bad/missing JSON | Wrong prompt, high temperature or missing field names | Tighten prompt, lower temperature, check example response |\n| Duplicate/Old Emails appear | Date filter not correct | Use 'newer_than:1d' and keep 'mark as read' in email node |\n| SMTP/Gmail Send errors | Auth problem, quota or app password missing | Use OAuth2, check daily send caps and app password settings |\n| Blank or partially filled summary table | AI unable to parse poorly formatted/empty email | Improve sender email consistency, add fallback handling |\n| Attachments not processed | No attachment extraction node | Add attachment-to-text parsing before AI node |\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you get stuck, need help customizing a mapping or adding nodes or want to integrate extra steps (e.g., resume text, Slack), just ask!\n\nWe're happy to guide you step by step, review your workflow, or help you troubleshoot any errors.\n\n**Contact WeblineIndia — Your n8n Automation partner!**",
