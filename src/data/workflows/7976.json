  "description": "### Who’s it for\n\nThis workflow is for **marketing teams, performance marketers, and media buyers** running Facebook (Meta) Ads who want to stay on top of creative performance without manually checking Ads Manager every day.\n\n### What it does\n\nThe workflow automatically monitors **Facebook Ads performance at the ad creative level** and sends **real-time Slack notifications** when key metrics cross your thresholds. It tracks CTR, CPC, ROAS, spend, and conversions over a rolling time window, then flags:\n\n* **Underperformers** (e.g. CTR below 0.5% for 2 days).\n* **Top performers** (e.g. ROAS above 5x).\n\n### What business value this workflow provides\n\n* **Faster detection of problems**\n  Instead of waiting for a weekly report, you know within a day (or whatever window you configure) if an ad’s CTR is tanking or if spend is producing poor ROAS. That prevents wasted budget.\n\n* **Highlighting winners**\n  When an ad’s ROAS is high (e.g. &gt;5x), you get an instant Slack ping. You can then shift budget to scale it before performance fades.\n\n* **Reduced manual monitoring**\n  Normally someone has to log into Meta Ads Manager daily, filter by campaign/ad, export CSVs, check CTR/ROAS, then write up notes. That’s time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this means you spend less time gathering data and more time making decisions.\n\n* **Team visibility**\n  Posting to Slack means the whole marketing team is aligned on what’s working and what isn’t, without sharing dashboards or CSVs around.\n\n### How it works\n\n1. Workflow trigger (manual or scheduled).\n2. Fetch **ad-level insights** from the Facebook Ads API.\n3. A Code node normalizes metrics (CTR %, CPC, ROAS, spend, conversions).\n4. Compare against your **CTR and ROAS thresholds**.\n5. If conditions are met, send a **Slack block message** with ad name, ID, spend, CTR, CPC, ROAS, and the reasons it was flagged.\n\n### How to set up\n\n* In the *Edit Fields* node, set your `act_id` (Facebook Ad Account ID) and `campaign_id`.\n* Adjust `ctr_min`, `roas_top`, and `lookback_days` to fit your goals.\n* Connect your **Slack credentials** and set the channel for alerts.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* A Facebook (Meta) Ads account with API access.\n* Slack workspace with a bot/app that has `chat:write` permission.\n* n8n credentials for both services.\n\n### How to customize\n\n* Add ad thumbnails by including `creative` in the insights fields.\n* Extend the workflow to **automatically pause underperforming ads**.",
