  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the creation of high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts using AI. It pulls keyword data from Google Sheets, conducts research via Perplexity AI, generates structured content (title, introduction, key takeaways, body, conclusion, and FAQs) with OpenAI and Anthropic models, assembles the post, performs final edits, converts to HTML, and publishes directly to WordPress. Ideal for content marketers, bloggers, or agencies looking to scale content production while maintaining relevance and engagement.\nKey Features\n\nKeyword-Driven Generation: Fetches primary keywords, search intent, and related terms from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to inform content strategy.\nAI Research & Structuring: Uses Perplexity for in-depth topic research and OpenAI/Anthropic for semantic analysis, outlines, and full content drafting.\nModular Content Creation: Generates sections like introductions, key takeaways, outlines, body, conclusions, and FAQs with tailored prompts for tone, style, and SEO.\nAssembly & Editing: Combines sections into a cohesive Markdown post, adds internal/external links, and applies final refinements for readability and flow.\nPublishing Automation: Converts Markdown to styled HTML and posts drafts to WordPress.\nCustomization Points: Easily adjust AI prompts, research depth, or output formats via Code and Set nodes.\n\nRequirements\n\nCredentials: OpenAI API (for GPT models), Perplexity API (for research), Google Sheets OAuth2 (for keyword input), WordPress API (for publishing).\nSetup: Configure your Google Sheets with columns like \"keyword\", \"search intent\", \"related keyword\", etc. Ensure the sheet is shared with your Google account.\nDependencies: No additional packages needed; relies on n8n's built-in nodes for AI, HTTP, and data processing.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTrigger & Input: Start manually or schedule; pulls keyword data from Google Sheets.\nResearch Phase: Uses Perplexity to gather topic insights and citations from reputable sources.\nContent Generation: AI nodes create title, structure, intro, takeaways, outline, body, conclusion, and FAQs based on research and SEO guidelines.\nAssembly & Refinement: Merges sections, embeds links, edits for polish, and converts to HTML.\nOutput: Publishes as a WordPress draft or outputs the final HTML for manual use.\n\nBenefits\n\nTime Savings: Automate 80-90% of content creation, reducing manual writing from hours to minutes.\nSEO Optimization: Incorporates primary/related keywords naturally, aligns with search intent, and includes semantic structures for better rankings.\nScalability: Process multiple keywords in batches; perfect for content calendars or high-volume blogging.\nQuality Assurance: Built-in editing ensures engaging, error-free content with real-world examples and data-backed insights.\nVersatility: Adaptable for any niche (e.g., marketing, tech, finance) by tweaking prompts or sheets.\n\nPotential Customizations\n\nAdd more AI models (e.g., via custom nodes) for varied tones.\nIntegrate image generation or social sharing for full content pipelines.\nFilter sheets for specific topics or add notifications on completion.",
