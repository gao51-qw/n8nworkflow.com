  "description": "## ✅💬Build Your Own WhatsApp Fact-Checking Bot with AI\n\nTired of misinformation spreading on WhatsApp? 🤨 This workflow transforms your n8n instance into a powerful, automated fact-checking bot\\! Send any news, claim, or question to a designated WhatsApp number, and this bot will use AI to research it, provide a verdict, and send back a summary with direct source links.\n\nFight fake news with the power of automation and AI\\! 🚀\n\n### How it works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow uses a simple but powerful three-step process:\n\n1.  **📬 WhatsApp Gateway (Webhook node):** This is the front door. The workflow starts when the **Webhook node** receives an incoming message from a user via a Twilio WhatsApp number.\n2.  **🕵️ The Digital Detective (Perplexity node):** The user's message is sent to the **Perplexity node**. Here, a powerful AI model, instructed by a custom system prompt, analyzes the claim, scours the web for reliable information, and generates a verdict (e.g., `✅ Likely True`, `❌ Likely False`).\n3.  **📲 WhatsApp Reply (Twilio node):** The final, formatted response, complete with the verdict, a simple summary, and source citations, is sent back to the original user via the **Twilio node**.\n\n### Setup Guide 🛠️\n\nFollow these steps carefully to get your fact-checking bot up and running.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n  * A [Twilio Account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) with an active phone number or access to the WhatsApp Sandbox.\n  * A [Perplexity AI Account](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to get an API key.\n\n#### 1\\. Configure Credentials\n\nYou'll need to add API keys for both Perplexity and Twilio to your n8n instance.\n\n  * **Perplexity AI:**\n    1.  Go to your Perplexity AI [API Settings](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api).\n    2.  Generate and copy your API Key.\n    3.  In n8n, go to **Credentials** \\& **New**, search for \"Perplexity,\" and add your key.\n  * **Twilio:**\n    1.  Go to your [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/).\n    2.  Find and copy your `Account SID` and `Auth Token`.\n    3.  In n8n, go to **Credentials** \\& **New**, search for \"Twilio,\" and add your credentials.\n\n#### 2\\. Set Up the Webhook and Tunnel\n\nTo allow Twilio's cloud service to communicate with your n8n instance, you need a public URL. The n8n tunnel is perfect for this.\n\n1.  **Start the n8n Tunnel:** If you are running n8n locally, you'll need to expose it to the web. Open your terminal and run:\n    ```bash\n    n8n start --tunnel\n    ```\n2.  **Copy Your Webhook URL:**\n      * Once the tunnel is active, open your n8n workflow.\n      * In the **Receive Whatsapp Messages** (Webhook) node, you will see two URLs: Test and Production.\n      * Copy the **Test/Production URL**. This is the public URL that Twilio will use.\n\n#### 3\\. Configure Your Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox\n\n1.  Go to the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/) and navigate to **Messaging** \\& **Try it out** \\& **Send a WhatsApp message**.\n2.  Select the **Sandbox Settings** tab.\n3.  In the section **\"WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN,\"** paste your n8n **Production Webhook URL**.\n4.  Make sure the method is set to `HTTP POST`.\n5.  Click **Save**.\n\n### How to Use Your Bot 🚀\n\n1.  **Activate the Sandbox:** To start, you (and any other users) must send a WhatsApp message with the join code (e.g., `join given-word`) to your Twilio Sandbox number. Twilio provides this phrase on the same Sandbox page.\n2.  **Fact-Check Away\\!** Once joined, simply send any claim or question to the Twilio number. For example: `Did Elon Musk discover a new planet?`\n3.  Within moments, the workflow will trigger, and you'll receive a formatted reply with the verdict and sources right in your chat\\!\n\n### Further Reading & Resources 🔗\n\n  * [n8n Tunnel Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)\n  * [Twilio for WhatsApp Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/quickstart/node)\n  * [Perplexity AI API Documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs)",
