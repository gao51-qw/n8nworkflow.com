  "description": "## What This Workflow Does\nThis workflow transforms Google Sheets into a **lightweight productivity engine** and connects it to Slack for **automated reminders and daily recaps**. No extra SaaS, no extra cost – just a simple system that keeps you on track and accountable.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-conditions / Requirements\nBefore you start, make sure you have:\n- A Google account with access to **Google Sheets**.\n- A Slack workspace where you can post reminders and summaries.\n- An n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud) with:\n  - **Google Sheets credentials** connected.\n  - **Slack credentials** connected.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Task Tracking in Google Sheets**\n   - Add tasks with columns: Task ID, Task Name, Due Date, Status, and Why it matters.\n   - The workflow checks for tasks that are due soon or overdue.\n\n2. **Automated Slack Reminders**\n   - Every 15 minutes, the workflow scans for tasks due in the next 30 minutes.\n   - Slack sends a ping with the task name, deadline, and reason.\n\n3. **Daily Recap at 6 PM**\n   - Slack posts a summary of how many tasks you completed vs how many are still pending.\n   - Encourages reflection and accountability.\n\n4. **Duplicate Protection**\n   - Each task has a \"Last Reminder Sent\" column so you don’t get spammed with repeat messages.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options\n- **Reminder Frequency**: Change the Cron node to check tasks every 5, 10, 30 minutes, or hourly.  \n- **Daily Recap Time**: Adjust the daily Cron node (default: 6 PM) to match your schedule.  \n- **Slack Channel**: Point reminders and recaps to a private DM, a public channel, or multiple channels.  \n- **Task Fields**: Add columns like `Priority`, `Assigned To`, or `Category` and adjust Slack messages accordingly.  \n- **Weekly Review**: Extend the workflow with another Cron node on Sundays to send a weekly productivity score.  \n- **Reflection Logs**: Add automation to write daily results into a second tab for trend tracking.  \n\n---\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ **Eliminate missed deadlines** with proactive reminders.  \n- ✅ **Daily accountability** inside Slack – no extra dashboards.  \n- ✅ **Zero SaaS costs** – only Sheets, Slack, and n8n.  \n- ✅ **Fully customizable** to match your workflow, team, or habits.  \n- ✅ **Scales easily** from solo use to team task tracking.  \n\n---\n\n## Use Cases\n- Solo founders or freelancers who want a **cheap but powerful task manager**.  \n- Small teams who live in Slack and want **lightweight accountability**.  \n- Productivity enthusiasts who want **flexibility and control** without being locked into another SaaS.
