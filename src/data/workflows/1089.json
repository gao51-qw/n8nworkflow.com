Follow the steps mentioned in the [documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/notion/), to create credentials for the Notion Trigger node.\n3. Create create [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/mattermost/) for Mattermost.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:499)\n\n**Notion Trigger:** The Notion Trigger node will trigger the workflow when new data gets added to Notion.\n\n**IF node:** This node will check if the notes belong to the team `Marketing`. If the team is `Marketing` the node will `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\n**Mattermost node:** This node will send a message about the new data in the channel 'Marketing' in Mattermost. If you have a different channel, use that instead. You can even replace the Mattermost node with nodes of other messaging platforms, like Slack, Telegram, Discord, etc.\n\n**NoOp node:** Adding this node here is optional, as the absence of this node won't make a difference to the functioning of the workflow.",
