  "description": "# Curate & post AI news to X, Bluesky, Threads & more via GPT-5 mini & Cue\n\nThis n8n template automatically curates AI news from RSS feeds and generates platform-tailored social media posts using GPT-5 mini. Posts are saved as drafts in Cue for review before publishing to X, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, and Facebook.\n\nUse cases include:\n* Daily automated AI/tech news curation\n* Multi-platform social media content creation\n* Building thought leadership with consistent posting\n* Staying on top of industry news without manual effort\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n* Tech content creators who want to share AI news across multiple platforms\n* Social media managers handling multiple accounts\n* Anyone building an audience around AI/tech topics\n* Teams who want consistent daily content without manual curation\n\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nManually curating news, writing platform-specific posts, and publishing across 5 different social networks is time-consuming. This workflow automates the entire process:\n* **Curation** - Pulls from 4 trusted AI/tech RSS feeds daily\n* **Deduplication** - Tracks posted articles in Google Sheets so you never share the same story twice\n* **Content creation** - GPT-5 mini writes posts tailored to each platform's style and character limits\n* **Review workflow** - Creates drafts in Cue so you can review before publishing\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs daily at 9am (configurable)\n2. **RSS Feeds** - Fetches articles from TechCrunch AI, Ars Technica AI, The Verge AI, and MIT Tech Review\n3. **Filter & Merge** - Combines all feeds and filters to articles from the last 7 days\n4. **Deduplication** - Compares against Google Sheets to find unposted articles\n5. **Random Selection** - Picks one random article from available stories\n6. **AI Generation** - GPT-5 mini generates 5 platform-specific posts with appropriate tone and length\n7. **Save to Cue** - Creates a draft post with all 5 platform variations\n8. **Log to Sheet** - Records the article URL to prevent future duplicates\n\n## Setup\n\n### Requirements\n* [Cue account](https://oncue.so) with connected social accounts\n* OpenAI API key\n* Google account for Sheets\n\n### Step 1: Install the Cue community node\n1. Go to **Settings** → **Community Nodes**\n2. Click **Install**\n3. Enter `@cuehq/n8n-nodes-cue`\n\n### Step 2: Create tracking spreadsheet\n1. Create a new Google Sheet named \"AI News Tracker\"\n2. Add these column headers in row 1:\n   * `article_url`\n   * `title`\n   * `source`\n   * `processed_at`\n\n### Step 3: Configure credentials\n1. **Google Sheets** - Add OAuth2 credentials and connect to the \"Get Recent Posts\" node\n2. **OpenAI** - Add your API key and connect to the \"GPT-5 mini\" node\n3. **Cue** - Add your API key from [Cue Settings](https://app.oncue.so/settings/api)\n\n### Step 4: Configure the Cue node\n1. Open the **Create Draft in Cue** node\n2. Select your **Profile**\n3. For each platform slot, select your social account:\n   * Slot 1 → X/Twitter\n   * Slot 2 → Bluesky\n   * Slot 3 → Threads\n   * Slot 4 → Mastodon\n   * Slot 5 → Facebook\n\nDon't have all 5 platforms? Simply delete the unused slots.\n\n### Step 5: Publish\nSave and click **Publish** to activate the workflow.\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n\n### Change the schedule\nEdit the **Daily 9am Trigger** node to run at a different time or frequency.\n\n### Use different RSS feeds\nReplace the feed URLs with sources relevant to your niche. The workflow handles any standard RSS feed. Keep 3-6 feeds for best results.\n\n### Auto-publish instead of drafts\nTo publish immediately instead of creating drafts, enable **Publish Immediately** in the Cue node settings.\n\n### Adjust the AI tone\nModify the system prompt in the **Write Social Posts** node to match your brand voice or adjust platform-specific guidelines.\n\n## Good to know\n\n* **Cost** - Each run uses one OpenAI API call. With GPT-5 mini, this costs approximately $0.01-0.02 per execution.\n* **Draft review** - Posts are created as drafts in Cue, giving you a chance to review and edit before publishing.\n* **Deduplication** - The Google Sheet tracks all posted URLs, so the same article is never shared twice.\n\n## About Cue\n\n[Cue](https://oncue.so) is a social media scheduling platform that lets you manage and publish content across X, Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram from a single dashboard.\n\nKey features:\n* **Multi-platform publishing** - Schedule once, publish everywhere\n* **Platform-specific content** - Tailor each post for different audiences\n* **Draft workflow** - Review and edit before publishing\n* **API & integrations** - Connect with n8n, Zapier, Make, and custom apps\n\n[Get started free](https://oncue.so) · [Documentation](https://docs.oncue.so) · [n8n Community Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cuehq/n8n-nodes-cue)\n",
