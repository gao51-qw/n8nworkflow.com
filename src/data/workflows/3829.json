It also serves as an excellent foundation for building more sophisticated AI-driven applications.\n\n### What problem does this workflow solve? / Use case\n\nThis workflow automates web searches by enabling an AI agent to efficiently retrieve and summarize external, verifiable information, ensuring accuracy through source citations.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n* Connects an AI agent node to [SearchApi.io](https://www.searchapi.io/) as an integrated search tool.\n* Empowers the AI agent to perform real-time web searches using various SearchApi engines (e.g., Google, Bing).\n* Allows the AI agent to dynamically determine search parameters based on user interaction, delivering contextually relevant results.\n* Ensures responses include clearly cited sources for validation and further exploration.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Install the [SearchApi community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@searchapi/n8n-nodes-searchapi)**:\n   * Open **Settings → Community Nodes** inside your self‑hosted n8n instance.\n   * Fill **npm Package Name** with `@searchapi/n8n-nodes-searchapi`.\n   * Accept the risk prompt, and hit **Install**.\n   * It should now appear as a node when you search for it.\n\n2. **API Configuration**:\n   * Set up your [SearchApi.io](https://www.searchapi.io/) credentials in n8n.\n   * Add your preferred LLM provider credentials (e.g., OpenRouter API).\n\n3. **Input Requirements**:\n   * Provide the YouTube video ID (e.g., `wBuULAoJxok`).\n\n4. **Connect LLM Integration**:\n   * Configure the summarization chain with your chosen model and parameters for text splitting.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n* Integrate additional nodes to structure or store search results (e.g., saving to databases, Notion, Google Sheets).\n* Extend chatbot capabilities to integrate with messaging platforms (Slack, Discord) or email notifications.\n* Adjust search parameters and filters within the AI agent node to tailor information retrieval.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n* **Input**: User asks, \"What are the latest developments in AI regulation?\"\n* **Output**: AI retrieves, summarizes, and cites recent, authoritative articles and news sources from the web.\n",
