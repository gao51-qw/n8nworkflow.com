  "title": "Automate sales order prioritization with ERP-WMS-TMS integration based on SLA tiers",
  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the prioritization and scheduling of sales orders based on customer SLAs, urgency, and profitability. It ensures that high-priority and SLA-critical orders are picked, packed, and dispatched first—improving fulfillment speed, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency across warehouses and logistics.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n* **Automated Order Fetching:** Periodically retrieves all pending or confirmed sales orders from ERP systems.\n* **Dynamic SLA-Based Prioritization:** Calculates order priority scores using urgency, customer tier, order value, and profit margin.\n* **Intelligent SLA Monitoring:** Identifies SLA breaches and automatically flags them for immediate handling.\n* **Automated Task Creation:** Generates urgent picking tasks and alerts warehouse managers in real-time.\n* **Smart Scheduling:** Optimizes picking and dispatch timelines based on urgency and capacity.\n* **Seamless ERP & TMS Integration:** Updates order statuses and schedules dispatches automatically.\n* **Operational Transparency:** Sends end-of-cycle summary reports via email to operations teams.\n\n---\n\n### Workflow Process\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger**\n\n   * Runs every 15 minutes to ensure orders are frequently evaluated.\n   * Maintains real-time responsiveness without overloading systems.\n\n2. **Fetch Pending Orders**\n\n   * Retrieves all orders in pending or confirmed state from ERP API.\n   * Configurable limit (e.g., 100 orders per run) for controlled processing.\n\n3. **Fetch Customer SLA Data**\n\n   * Collects SLA tiers, delivery timeframes, and customer-specific priorities from ERP or CRM API.\n   * Supports dynamic customer segmentation (Gold, Silver, Bronze tiers).\n\n4. **Calculate Priority Scores**\n\n   * Assigns weighted priority scores based on multiple criteria:\n\n     * Urgency: **40%**\n     * Tier: **30%**\n     * Order Value: **20%**\n     * Profit Margin: **10%**\n   * Produces a composite score used for sorting and scheduling.\n\n5. **Check if SLA Critical**\n\n   * Detects if any order is close to or past SLA deadlines.\n   * Routes SLA-breached orders for immediate escalation.\n\n6. **Create Urgent Picking Task**\n\n   * Generates warehouse picking tasks for critical orders.\n   * Assigns to senior pickers or rapid response teams.\n\n7. **Alert Warehouse Manager**\n\n   * Sends instant SMS and email alerts for SLA-critical or high-priority orders.\n   * Ensures immediate managerial attention.\n\n8. **Batch Normal Orders**\n\n   * Groups non-critical orders into batches of 10 for optimized processing.\n   * Reduces load on WMS while maintaining steady throughput.\n\n9. **Generate Picking Schedule**\n\n   * Creates smart picking schedules based on urgency:\n\n     * **High Priority:** Same-day\n     * **Normal:** Within 1 day\n     * **Low:** Within 2–3 days\n\n10. **Create Bulk Picking Tasks**\n\n    * Pushes picking tasks into WMS (Warehouse Management System).\n    * Uses auto-assignment and route optimization logic.\n\n11. **Generate Dispatch Schedule**\n\n    * Builds dispatch timelines according to delivery method: Express, Priority, or Standard.\n    * Syncs with transport capacity data.\n\n12. **Schedule Dispatches in TMS**\n\n    * Sends dispatch requests to TMS (Transport Management System).\n    * Books carriers and reserves capacity for each batch.\n\n13. **Update Order Statuses**\n\n    * Updates ERP with new order statuses, schedules, and expected delivery dates.\n    * Maintains a unified view across systems.\n\n14. **Generate Summary Report**\n\n    * Creates a summary JSON report including:\n\n      * Total orders processed\n      * SLA-critical cases\n      * Dispatch breakdowns\n      * Next deadlines\n\n15. **Send Summary Notification**\n\n    * Emails the operations team with execution summary and performance metrics.\n    * Ensures team alignment and SLA visibility.\n\n---\n\n### Industries That Benefit\n\nThis automation is especially valuable for:\n\n* **E-commerce & Retail:** To prioritize same-day or express deliveries for VIP customers.\n* **Logistics & 3PL Providers:** For meeting tight SLAs across multiple clients and delivery tiers.\n* **Manufacturing & B2B Distribution:** Ensures high-value or contractual orders are prioritized.\n* **Pharma & Healthcare:** Critical for time-sensitive and compliance-driven deliveries.\n* **Consumer Goods & FMCG:** Helps manage high-volume dispatch with smart scheduling.\n\n---\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* ERP system with API access (e.g., SAP, Odoo, NetSuite).\n* WMS and TMS integrations with order/task APIs.\n* SMTP and SMS gateway credentials for notifications.\n* n8n instance with HTTP, Function, Email, and Scheduler nodes installed.\n\n---\n\n### Modification Options\n\n* Customize priority scoring weights per business type.\n* Integrate AI for predictive SLA breach forecasting.\n* Add Slack/Teams channels for real-time operational alerts.\n* Implement escalation routing for unassigned urgent tasks.\n* Extend reports to include OTIF (On-Time-In-Full) metrics.\n\n---\n\n**Explore More AI-Powered Workflows:**\n[Contact us](https://www.oneclickitsolution.com/contact-us/) for customized supply chain and order management
