Typically you need to gather more detailed information about them (data enrichment) and finally update their profile in your CRM system to better manage and nurture your relationship with them. This workflow does this all for you!\n\n## What this workflow does\nThe workflow runs every time a user is subscribed to a ConvertKit list. It then filters out personal emails, before enriching the email. If the email is attached to a company it enriches the company and upserts it in your Hubspot CRM.\n\n## Setup\n1. Add `Clearbit`, `Hubspot`, and `ConvertKit` credentials.\n2. Click on `Test workflow`.\n3. Subscribe to a list on `ConvertKit` to trigger the workflow.\n\nBe aware that you can adapt this workflow to work with your enrichment tool, CRM, and email automation tool of choice.\n",
