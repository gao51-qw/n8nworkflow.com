  "description": "# [🎥 Watch the Full Execution on YouTube](https://youtu.be/_VAOeIzC6M0?si=etrUjAGyzwXTiZ6D)\n\n# **Workflow Description (in-depth):**\n\nThis workflow automates the entire process of **monitoring online reputation** by scanning Reddit posts for negative sentiment about your company, filtering only the relevant criticism, and logging it directly into Google Sheets for easy tracking.\n\n### 🔑 **Key Features:**\n\n* **Automated Triggering:**\n  Runs on a schedule so you never miss new discussions about your brand.\n\n* **Smart Data Fetching:**\n  Uses Reddit API to pull the latest posts matching your chosen keywords (e.g., “Notion”).\n\n* **Post Processing:**\n  Breaks down bulk Reddit responses into individual posts for analysis.\n\n* **AI-Powered Filtering:**\n  A custom-built AI agent reviews the content and extracts only **genuine negative PR** (complaints, bad experiences, harmful mentions). Neutral or positive posts are ignored.\n\n* **Structured Parsing:**\n  AI responses are enforced into a clean JSON schema (ID, Title, URL, NegativeContent).... ensuring compatibility with downstream nodes.\n\n* **Noise Reduction:**\n  A code node ensures only posts with meaningful content are passed forward.\n\n* **Centralized Logging:**\n  Captures critical information (post title, negative excerpt, URL, ID) into Google Sheets.... giving teams a live dashboard of issues to address.\n\n* **Customizable & Scalable:**\n  Swap out “Notion” for your own brand, or expand to other platforms.... the flow adapts without extra overhead.\n\n### 🚀 **Why This Matters:**\n\nIn 2025, a single Reddit thread can shape brand reputation overnight. Manually monitoring is inefficient, and traditional social listening tools generate too much noise. This workflow gives you a **lean, automated, AI-powered system** to stay ahead of potential PR risks.\n\n### 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**\n\n* **n8n** for automation\n* **Reddit API** for data fetching\n* **LangChain AI Agent + Google Vertex Model** for sentiment & context analysis\n* **Google Sheets** for reporting & tracking",
