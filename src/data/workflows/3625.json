Fill in x-api-key in Mijdourney Generator node and Generate Kling Video node, fill in Header Parameters of GPT-4o Image Generator (e.g., Bearer + your X-API-Key)\n2. Enter your model prompt based on your inspiration.\n3. Click Test Workflow.\n4. Get the video URL in the last node.\n\n\n### Use Case \nThe prompt node concludes the main features of creations. An example for users' reference is listed as follow: \n#### Input Prompt\nA blind box character design, in the chibi style, a super cute little girl wearing a white long-sleeved dress and pearl earrings with her head bowed in a prayer pose, facing upwards, wearing an oversized off-white dress with large round pearls on the shoulders, minimalist simple dress with Ruffles, against a beige background, a full-body shot in a three-quarter profile view, with a black, blue, and gray color scheme, soft lighting, 3D rendering, clay material, high detail, in the Pixar style. Clean white skin, brown renaissance braided bun. --ar 1:1 --niji 6\n\n### Output Video\nAn Example for your reference.\n<video src=\"https://static.piapi.ai/n8n-instruction/general-3d-presentation/example1.mp4\" controls />\n\n\n### More Example Results for Reference\n<video src=\"https://static.piapi.ai/n8n-instruction/general-3d-presentation/example3.mp4\" controls />\n\n",
