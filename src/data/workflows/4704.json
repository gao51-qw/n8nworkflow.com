  "description": "This n8n template provides a simple yet powerful utility for validating if a given string input is a valid JSON format. You can use this to pre-validate data received from external sources, ensure data integrity before further processing, or provide immediate feedback to users submitting JSON strings.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 How it works\n- Webhook: This node acts as the entry point for the workflow, listening for incoming POST requests. It expects a JSON body with a single property:\n\n  - jsonString: The string that you want to validate as JSON.\n\n- Code (JSON Validator): This node contains custom JavaScript code that attempts to parse the jsonString provided in the webhook body.\n\n  - If the jsonString can be successfully parsed, it means it's valid JSON, and the node returns an item with valid: true.\n  - If parsing fails, it catches the error and returns an item with valid: false and the specific error message.\n  - This logic is applied to each item passed through the node, ensuring all inputs are validated.\n\n- Respond to Webhook: This node sends the validation result (either valid: true or valid: false with an error message) back to the service that initiated the webhook request.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who is it for?\n### This workflow is ideal for:\n\n- Developers & Integrators: Pre-validate JSON payloads from external systems (APIs, webhooks) before processing them in your workflows, preventing errors.\n- Data Engineers: Ensure the integrity of JSON data before storing it in databases or data lakes.\n- API Builders: Offer a dedicated endpoint for clients to test their JSON strings for validity.\n- Customer Support Teams: Quickly check user-provided JSON configurations for errors.\n- Anyone handling JSON data: A quick and easy way to programmatically check JSON string correctness without writing custom code in every application.\n\n---\n\n## 📑 Data Structure\nWhen you trigger the webhook, send a POST request with a JSON body structured as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"jsonString\": \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"n8n\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"workflow\\\"}\"\n}\n```\n\nExample of an invalid JSON string:\n\n```\n{\n  \"jsonString\": \"{name: \\\"n8n\\\"}\" // Missing quotes around 'name'\n}\n```\n\nThe workflow will return a JSON response indicating validity:\n\nFor a valid JSON string:\n\n```\n{\n  \"valid\": true\n}\n```\n\nFor an invalid JSON string:\n\n```\n{\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"error\": \"Unexpected token 'n', \\\"{name: \\\"n8n\\\"}\\\" is not valid JSON\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n- Import Workflow:\n  - In your n8n editor, click \"Import from JSON\" and paste the provided workflow JSON.\n\n- Configure Webhook Path:\n  - Double-click the Webhook node.\n  - In the 'Path' field, set a unique and descriptive path (e.g., /validate-json).\n\n- Activate Workflow:\n  - Save and activate the workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Tips\nThis JSON validator workflow is a solid starting point. Consider these enhancements:\n\n- Enhanced Error Feedback:\n  - Upgrade: Add a Set node after the Code node to format the error message into a more user-friendly string before responding.\n  - Leverage: Make it easier for the caller to understand the issue.\n\n- Logging Invalid Inputs:\n  - Upgrade: After the Code node, add an IF node to check if valid is false. If so, branch to a node that logs the invalid jsonString and error to a Google Sheet, database, or a logging service.\n  - Leverage: Track common invalid inputs for debugging or improvement.\n\n- Transforming Valid JSON:\n  - Upgrade: If the JSON is valid, you could add another Function node to parse the jsonString and then operate on the parsed JSON data directly within the workflow.\n  - Leverage: Use this validator as the first step in a larger workflow that processes JSON data.\n\n- Asynchronous Validation:\n  - Upgrade: For very large JSON strings or high-volume requests, consider using a separate queueing mechanism (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) and an asynchronous response pattern.\n  - Leverage: Prevent webhook timeouts and improve system responsiveness.",
