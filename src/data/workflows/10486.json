If you find yourself in one of these roles, this workflow is for you:\n\n*   💼 **Business Owners & Executives:** Maintain a high-level overview of your company's daily performance without getting lost in spreadsheets. Make proactive, strategic decisions with confidence.\n*   📈 **Sales & Marketing Leaders:** Get immediate, next-day feedback on your campaigns and promotions. Did that flash sale work? You'll know tomorrow, not next month.\n*   📊 **Finance & Operations Managers:** Proactively detect financial irregularities, potential issues with payment channels, or significant data entry errors before they snowball.\n*   👨‍💼 **Account Managers & Consultants:** Effortlessly monitor the financial health of your clients' accounts, providing exceptional, proactive service that sets you apart.\n\n***\n\n## 🌟 Key Features\n\n*   **Daily Automated Execution:** Runs on a schedule every morning to analyze the previous day's performance.\n*   **Intelligent Benchmarking:** Calculates a rolling 30-day average to create a dynamic and reliable performance benchmark.\n*   **Complete Revenue Picture:** Gathers data from both **Paid Invoices** and **Sales Receipts** in QuickBooks Online to ensure total accuracy.\n*   **Fully Configurable Threshold:** You have complete control over what constitutes an \"anomaly.\" The default is a +/- 40% deviation, but it can be changed to any value.\n*   **Premium Dark-Mode Email Alert:** Delivers a stunning, mobile-responsive HTML email that uses dynamic colors and icons to visually represent a sales spike (green) or drop (amber).\n*   **Robust Error Handling:** The workflow is designed to run smoothly even on days with zero sales, preventing crashes and ensuring reliability.\n\n***\n\n## 🛠️ Prerequisites\n\nTo use this workflow, you will need active credentials for the following services:\n\n1.  **QuickBooks Online:** To connect to your company's financial data.\n2.  **Email (SMTP):** To send the final alert. This can be a generic SMTP provider, Gmail, Microsoft 365, etc.\n\n***\n\n## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide\n\nGetting this powerful detector running is a simple 3-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Connect Your Credentials\n\nThis is the most important step. You only need to configure two types of credentials.\n\n*   #### **(A) QuickBooks Online Account**\n    1.  Find the first QuickBooks node, named **`Fetch_30Day_Invoices`**.\n    2.  In the parameters panel on the right, locate the **\"Credentials\"** field.\n    3.  Select your existing QuickBooks credential or create a new one.\n    4.  Once configured, ensure you select this **same credential** for the other three QuickBooks nodes (`Fetch_30Day_Sales_Receipts`, `Fetch_Yesterday_Invoices`, and `Fetch_Yesterday_Sales_Receipts`).\n\n*   #### **(B) Email Account**\n    1.  Navigate to the final node in the workflow, named **`Send_Alert_Email`**.\n    2.  In its \"Credentials\" field, select or create your SMTP/Email account credential.\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Workflow Parameters\n\n*   #### **(A) Set the Anomaly Threshold**\n    1.  Click on the **`Check_If_Anomaly`** (IF) node.\n    2.  In the parameters, you will see `Value 2` is set to `{{ 40 }}`. This represents a +/- 40% deviation.\n    3.  **Action:** Change this number to make the alert more or less sensitive to your needs.\n\n*   #### **(B) Configure the Email Recipient**\n    1.  Click on the final node, **`Send_Alert_Email`**.\n    2.  Update the **`To Email`** field with the email address (or a comma-separated list of addresses) where alerts should be sent.\n    3.  Update the **`From Email`** to your desired sending address.\n\n![Screenshot 20251104 at 11.52.46 AM.png](fileId:3159)\n![Screenshot 20251104 at 11.53.06 AM.png](fileId:3158)\n\n\n### Step 3: Activate Your Workflow\n\n*   Click the **\"Active\"** toggle in the top-right corner of your n8n canvas.\n\nCongratulations! Your automated Sales Anomaly Detector is now live and will keep you informed every morning.\n\n***\n\n## 🎨 Customization & Final Notes\n\n*   **Schedule:** The `Run_Every_Morning` node is set to trigger at 7 AM daily. You can easily adjust this to any time or frequency you prefer.\n*   **Email Design:** The HTML code in the `Send_Alert_Email` node is fully accessible. Feel free to modify the colors, text, or add your company logo to the footer to fully personalize it.\n*   **Creator:** This workflow was designed and built by **Elegant Biztech**.
