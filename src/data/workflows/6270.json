  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template launches your very first **AI Agent** —an AI-powered chatbot that can do more than just talk— it can take action using tools.\n\nThink of an AI Agent as a smart assistant, and the tools are the apps on its phone. By connecting it to other nodes, you give your agent the ability to interact with real-world data and services, like checking the weather, fetching news, or even sending emails on your behalf.\n\nThis workflow is designed to be the perfect starting point:\n*   **The Chat Interface:** A `Chat Trigger` node provides a simple, clean interface for you to talk to your agent.\n*   **The Brains:** The `AI Agent` node receives your messages, intelligently decides which tool to use (if any), and formulates a helpful response. Its personality and instructions are fully customizable in the \"System Message\".\n*   **The Language Model:** It uses **Google Gemini** to power its reasoning and conversation skills.\n*   **The Tools:** It comes pre-equipped with two tools to demonstrate its capabilities:\n    1.  **Get Weather:** Fetches real-time weather forecasts.\n    2.  **Get News:** Reads any RSS feed to get the latest headlines.\n*   **The Memory:** A `Conversation Memory` node allows the agent to remember the last few messages, enabling natural, follow-up conversations.\n\n### Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~2 minutes**\n\nYou only need one thing to get started: a free Google AI API key.\n\n1.  **Get Your Google AI API Key:**\n    *   Visit Google AI Studio at [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).\n    *   Click **\"Create API key in new project\"** and copy the key that appears.\n\n2.  **Add Your Credential in n8n:**\n    *   On the workflow canvas, go to the **`Connect your model`** (Google Gemini) node.\n    *   Click the **Credential** dropdown and select **`+ Create New Credential`**.\n    *   Paste your API key into the **API Key** field and click **Save**.\n\n3.  **Start Chatting!**\n    *   Go to the **`Example Chat`** node.\n    *   Click the **\"Open Chat\"** button in its parameter panel.\n    *   Try asking it one of the example questions, like: *\"What's the weather in Paris?\"* or *\"Get me the latest tech news.\"*\n\nThat's it! You now have a fully functional AI Agent. Try adding more tools (like Gmail or Google Calendar) to make it even more powerful.",
