  "description": "This workflow takes off the task of backing up workflows regularly on Github and uses Google Drive as the main tool to host these. \n\nThis can be a good way to keep track of your workflows so that you never lose any workflows in case your n8n goes down.\n\n## How does it work\n\n1. Creates a new folder within a specified folder with the time its backed up\n2. Loops around all workflows, converts them to a JSON file and uploads them to the created folder\n3. Gets the previous backups and deletes them\n\nThis has a clean feel and look as it simplifies the backup while not keeping a cache of workflows on your drive.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Create a new folder\n2. Create new service account credentials\n3. Share the folder with the `service account` email\n4. Upload this workflow to your canvas and map the credentials\n5. Set the schedule that you need your workflows to run and manage your backups\n6. Activate the workflow\n\nHappy Productivity!\n\n[@Imperol](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharia-kimotho/)",
