  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow identifies HubSpot deals that have gone untouched for 21+ days and automatically updates their status to Closed Lost. It fetches associated contacts, retrieves their details, and sends personalized follow-up emails requesting feedback. Finally, it notifies your team via Slack about the deals moved to Closed Lost. The workflow runs on a scheduled interval, ensuring consistent lead management without manual intervention.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**1. Trigger the workflow**  \n- **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow at a defined interval (daily, weekly, etc.).  \n- **Get HubSpot Deals** – Retrieves all deals with key properties from HubSpot.  \n- **Extract Deal Fields** – Normalizes deal data for consistent processing.  \n\n**2. Identify and update cold deals**  \n- **Filter Cold Leads (21+ days)** – Keeps only deals not updated in the past 21 days.  \n- **Update Deal to Closed Lost** – Marks stale deals as Closed Lost in HubSpot.  \n\n**3. Map deals to contacts**  \n- **Fetch Deal Associations** – Retrieves contacts linked to filtered deals.  \n- **Extract Contact IDs** – Parses associations to get contactId, dealId, and dealName.  \n- **Get Contact Details** – Fetches enriched contact information.  \n- **Extract Contact Email** – Simplifies data, keeping only the email field.  \n\n**4. Follow-up & team notification**  \n- **Send Gmail Feedback Request** – Sends a personalized thank-you email requesting feedback.  \n- **Send Slack Notification** – Alerts the team about deals updated to Closed Lost.  \n\n## Why use this?\n\n- Ensures timely closure of stale HubSpot deals, keeping your pipeline clean.  \n- Automates follow-up emails to gather valuable feedback from disengaged leads.  \n- Reduces manual effort in deal management and contact outreach.  \n- Keeps your team informed in real-time with Slack notifications.  \n- Improves sales process efficiency and lead data hygiene.\n",
