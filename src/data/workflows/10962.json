  "description": "This workflow automatically scrapes Amazon price-drop data via Decodo, extracts structured product details with OpenAI, generates summaries and sentiment insights for each item, and saves everything to Google Sheets — creating a fully automated price-intelligence pipeline.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nPlease note - This workflow is only available on n8n self-hosted as it’s making use of the community node for the Decodo Web Scraping\n\n![Extract, Summarize, Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Price Drops via Decodo](fileId:3407)\n\n## Who this is for\n\nThis workflow is designed for e-commerce analysts, product researchers, price-tracking teams, and affiliate marketers who want to:\n\n- Monitor daily Amazon product price drops automatically.\n- Extract key information such as product name, price, discount, and links.\n- Generate AI-driven summaries and sentiment insights on the latest deals.\n- Store all structured data directly in Google Sheets for trend analysis and reporting.\n\n## What problem this workflow solves\n\nThis workflow solves the following:\n\n- Eliminates the need for manual data scraping or tracking.\n- Turns unstructured web data into structured datasets.\n- Adds AI-generated summaries and sentiment analysis for smarter decision-making.\n- Enables automated, daily price intelligence tracking across multiple product categories.\n\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis automation combines Decodo’s web scraping, OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini, and Google Sheets to deliver an end-to-end price intelligence system.\n\n**Trigger & Setup**  \n   - Manually start the workflow.\n   - Input your price-drop URL (default: [CamelCamelCamel Daily Drops](https://camelcamelcamel.com/top_drops?t=daily)).\n\n**Web Scraping via Decodo**  \n   - Decodo scrapes the Amazon price-drop listings and extracts product details (title, price, savings, product link).\n\n**LLM-Powered Data Structuring**  \n   - The extracted content is sent to OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to format and clean the output into structured JSON fields.\n\n**Loop & Deep Analysis**  \n   - Each product URL is revisited by Decodo for content enrichment.\n   - The AI performs two analyses per product:\n     - **Summarization:** Generates a comprehensive summary of the product.\n     - **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects tone (positive/neutral/negative), sentiment score, and key topics.\n\n**Aggregation & Storage**  \n   - All enriched results are merged and aggregated.\n   - Structured data is automatically appended to a connected Google Sheet.\n\n**End Result:**  \n\nA ready-to-use dataset showing each price-dropped product, its summary, sentiment polarity, and key highlights updated in real time.\n\n## Setup\n\n#### Pre-requisite\n\nPlease make sure to install the n8n custom node for Decodo.\n\nIf you are new to Decode, please signup on this link [visit.decodo.com](https://visit.decodo.com/dOxzkK)\n\n![Install Community Nodes](fileId:3341)\n\n![Install Decodo Community Node](fileId:3340)\n\n### Import and Connect Credentials\nImport the workflow into your **n8n self-hosted** instance.\n\nConnect:\n- **OpenAI API (GPT-4.1-mini)** → for summarization and sentiment analysis  \n- **Decodo API** → for real-time price-drop scraping  \n- **Google Sheets OAuth2** → to save structured results  \n\n### Configure Input Fields\nIn the **“Set input fields”** node:\n- Update the `price_drop_url` to your target URL (e.g., `https://camelcamelcamel.com/top_drops?t=weekly`).\n\n### Run the Workflow\nClick **“Execute Workflow”** or schedule it to run daily to automatically fetch and analyze new price-drop listings.\n\n### Check Output\n- The aggregated data is saved to a **Google Sheet** (`Pricedrop Info`).\n- Each record contains:\n  - Product name  \n  - Current price and savings  \n  - Product link  \n  - AI-generated summary  \n  - Sentiment classification and score  \n\n##  How to customize this workflow\n\n### Change Source\n- Replace the `price_drop_url` with another **CamelCamelCamel** or **Amazon Deals** URL.\n- Add multiple URLs and loop through them for category-based price tracking.\n\n### Modify Extraction Schema\n- In the **Structured Output Parser**, modify the JSON schema to include fields like:\n  - `category`, `brand`, `rating`, or `availability`.\n\n### Tune AI Prompts\n- Edit the Summarize Content and Sentiment Analysis nodes to:\n  - Add tone analysis (e.g., promotional vs. factual).\n  - Include competitive product comparison.\n\n### Integrate More Destinations\n- Replace Google Sheets with:\n  - **Airtable** → for no-code dashboards.  \n  - **PostgreSQL/MySQL** → for large-scale storage.  \n  - **Notion or Slack** → for instant price-drop alerts.\n\n### Automate Scheduling\n- Add a **Cron Trigger** node to run this workflow daily or hourly.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis workflow creates a fully automated price intelligence system that:\n\n- Scrapes Amazon product price drops via Decodo.\n- Extracts structured data with OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini.\n- Generates AI-powered summaries and sentiment insights.\n- Updates a connected Google Sheet with each run.\n",
