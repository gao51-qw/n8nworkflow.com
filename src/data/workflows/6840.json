No typing. No mess. Just upload and go.\n\n## 👤 Who’s it for\n\n- Sales & Business Development Teams  \n- Recruiters & Talent Acquisition Specialists  \n- Event Teams collecting business cards  \n- Admins who manage contact databases manually  \n\n## ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow automates the extraction of contact details from uploaded name card (business card) images and stores them in a structured Google Sheet for easy tracking and follow-up.\n\n### Workflow Steps:\n1. User uploads one or more name card images through a web form.\n2. The uploaded files are saved to a Google Drive folder for archiving.\n3. A smart AI agent (with OCR and GPT capabilities) scans each image and extracts relevant contact data into structured JSON format.\n4. Data is transformed, cleaned (e.g., removing `+` from phone numbers), and filtered.\n5. Valid contacts are appended to a Google Sheet for central tracking and future use.\n\n## 🛠 How to set up\n\n1. **Create a Form**  \n   - Allow file upload (JPG/PNG format).\n   - Label it as “Name Card Uploader” with a clear description.\n\n2. **Upload to Google Drive**  \n   - Use the Google Drive node to store uploaded images.\n\n3. **Configure Smart Agent**  \n   - Use GPT-4o or similar model with OCR capability.\n   - Apply a structured output parser to extract contact fields like name, phone, email, company, etc.\n\n4. **Transform Data**  \n   - Use the Code node to clean and structure contact info.\n   - Strip out unwanted characters from phone numbers (e.g., `+`).\n\n5. **Filter Invalid Records**  \n   - Remove entries with no meaningful contact data.\n\n6. **Append to Google Sheets**  \n   - Use the Google Sheets node with \"Append Sheet Row\".\n   - Map fields to columns like Name, Phone, Email, etc.\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- n8n workflow environment  \n- Google Drive integration (for file storage)  \n- Google Sheets integration (for storing contacts)  \n- GPT-4o or any image-capable LLM  \n- Clear name card images (PNG/JPG, readable text)  \n- (Optional) Slack/email integration for notifications\n\n## 🧩 How to customize the workflow\n\n- **CRM Sync**: Connect to platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zoho.  \n- **Validation Logic**: Ensure records contain key fields like name or email before writing.  \n- **Uploader Info**: Attach submitter metadata to each contact record.  \n- **Language Adaptation**: Adjust extracted field labels/output to target your preferred language.  \n- **Batch Upload**: Handle multiple cards in a single image or multiple uploads in one go.",
