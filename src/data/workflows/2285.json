Just select your Spotify credentials and activate the workflow.\n- In Spotify just enable automatic downloads on the automatically created Downloads folder after the first workflow run.\n\n## Current limitations\nThis setup currently supports a maximum of 50 songs in the Downloads Playlist. This is due to the paylod limits defined by Spotify encountered in the *Get liked songs* node. Implementing batching would solve the issue.",
