Categories like \"Headline #1,\" \"Editor's Picks,\" and \"Europe News\" are all structured into a single data block.\n\n5. **Summarization**  \n   An **AI Agent** (Google Gemini) takes the aggregated news data and creates a concise, HTML-formatted summary tailored to give investors an insightful market snapshot.\n\n6. **Email Delivery**  \n   Finally, the **Microsoft Outlook** node sends the summary via email to the designated recipient with the subject \"Financial news from today.\"\n\nThis process ensures that financial news is efficiently curated, summarized, and delivered without manual intervention.\n",
