If fields don’t appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  \n\n**Field Mapping and Adjustments:**  \nOpen each KlickTipp node and map fields to match your setup. The workflow includes placeholders for:  \n- Invitee details (first name, last name, email, and phone).  \n- Event details (start/end times, timezone, etc.).  \n\n**Workflow Logic**  \n\n1. **Trigger via Calendly event Booking:**  \n   A new form event booking or cancellation from Calendly initiates the workflow  \n\n2. **Data Transformation:**  \n   Processes raw Calendly event data to ensure compatibility with KlickTipp’s API.  \n\n3. **Add to KlickTipp Subscriber List:**  \n   Adds invitees and guests to the designated KlickTipp list, including event-specific details.  \n\n**Benefits**  \n\n**Efficient lead generation:** Contacts from event bookings are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  \n**Automated processes:** Experts can start workflows directly, such as reminder emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  \n**Error-free data management:** The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  \n\n**Testing and Deployment**  \n\nTest the workflow by triggering a Calendly event and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  \n\n**Notes:**  \n\n**Customization:**  \nUpdate field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup. This ensures accurate data syncing.  \n\n**Resources:**\n- [Calendly KlickTipp Knowledge Base help article](https://www.klicktipp.com/de/support/wissensdatenbank/calendly-integration/)\n- [Use KlickTipp Community Node in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/install-klicktipp-node-n8n/)\n- [Automate Workflows: KlickTipp Integration in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/klicktipp-integration-n8n/)\n",
