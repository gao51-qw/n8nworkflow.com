  "description": "Enhance event logistics with this automated n8n workflow. Triggered by seating requests, it fetches attendee data and venue templates from Google Sheets, calculates totals, and optimizes seating layouts. The workflow generates detailed recommendations, splits individual assignments, and sends alerts, ensuring efficient venue planning and real-time updates. 🎪📋\n\n### Key Features  \n- Optimizes seating arrangements based on attendee data and event type.  \n- Generates venue layouts with visual and statistical insights.  \n- Provides real-time alerts with comprehensive seating plans.  \n- Logs detailed assignments and layouts in Google Sheets.  \n\n### Workflow Process  \n- The **Webhook Trigger** node initiates the workflow upon receiving venue requirements and attendee data via webhook.  \n- **Validate Request Data** ensures the incoming data is complete and accurate.  \n- **Fetch Attendee Data** retrieves attendee information, including groups, accessibility needs, and VIP preferences from Google Sheets.  \n- **Fetch Venue Templates** reads venue layout templates from Google Sheets.  \n- **Calculate Totals** aggregates attendee data and venue constraints for optimal planning.  \n- **Combine All Data** merges attendee and venue data for analysis.  \n- **AI Optimization** uses algorithms to calculate optimal seating based on venue dimensions, attendee groups, accessibility needs, VIP placement, and aisle placement.  \n- **Optimize Seating Layout** refines the seating plan for efficiency.  \n- **Format Recommendations** structures the seating plan with visual layout map, seat assignments, statistics & metrics, and optimization tips.  \n- **Split Seat Assignments** divides the plan into individual seat assignments.  \n- **Send Response** returns the complete seating plan with visual layout map, seat assignment list, statistics & recommendations, and export-ready format.  \n- **Send Alert** notifies organizers with the finalized plan details.  \n- **Update Sheets** saves the master plan summary, individual seat assignments, and layout specifications to Google Sheets.  \n- **Save Individual Assignments** appends or updates individual seat assignments to Google Sheets.  \n\n### Setup Instructions  \n- Import the workflow into n8n and configure Google Sheets OAuth2 for data access.  \n- Set up the Webhook Trigger with your event management system's API credentials.  \n- Configure the AI Optimization node with a suitable algorithm or model.  \n- Test the workflow by sending sample seating requests and verifying layouts.  \n- Adjust optimization parameters as needed for specific venue or event requirements.  \n\n### Prerequisites  \n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials  \n- Webhook integration with the event management system  \n- Structured attendee and venue data in a Google Sheet  \n\n**Google Sheet Structure:**  \n1. Attendee Data Sheet with columns:  \n   - Name  \n   - Group  \n   - Accessibility Needs  \n   - VIP Status  \n   - Preferences  \n   - Updated At  \n2. Venue Templates Sheet with columns:  \n   - Venue Name  \n   - Capacity  \n   - Dimensions  \n   - Layout Template  \n   - Updated At  \n\n### Modification Options  \n- Customize the **Validate Request Data** node to include additional validation rules.  \n- Adjust the **AI Optimization** node to prioritize specific criteria (e.g., proximity, accessibility).  \n- Modify the **Format Recommendations** node to include custom visual formats.  \n- Integrate with venue management tools for live layout updates.  \n- Set custom alert triggers in the **Send Alert** node.  \n\n**Discover more workflows – [Get in touch with us](https://www.oneclickitsolution.com/contact-us/)**",
