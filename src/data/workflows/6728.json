  "description": "# AI Conference Intelligence & Networking Optimizer with ScrapeGraphAI\n\n&gt; **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This template requires a self-hosted n8n instance with ScrapeGraphAI integration. It cannot be used with n8n Cloud due to web scraping capabilities.**\n\n![Conference Intelligence Workflow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/4A90E2/FFFFFF?text=Conference+Intelligence+Workflow+Preview)\n\nThis workflow automatically discovers industry conferences and provides AI-powered networking intelligence to maximize your event ROI.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically discovers industry conferences and provides AI-powered networking intelligence to maximize your event ROI.\n\n## Key Steps\n\n1. **Scheduled Discovery** - Runs weekly to find new industry conferences from Eventbrite and other sources.\n2. **AI-Powered Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract comprehensive conference information including speakers, agenda, and networking opportunities.\n3. **Speaker Intelligence** - Analyzes speakers to identify high-priority networking targets based on their role, company, and expertise.\n4. **Agenda Analysis** - Extracts and maps the complete conference schedule to optimize your time and networking strategy.\n5. **Networking Strategy** - Generates AI-powered recommendations for maximizing networking ROI with prioritized contact lists and approach strategies.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: 10-15 minutes**\n\n1. **Configure ScrapeGraphAI credentials** - Add your ScrapeGraphAI API key for web scraping capabilities.\n2. **Customize conference sources** - Update the Eventbrite URL to target specific industries or locations.\n3. **Adjust monitoring frequency** - Modify the weekly trigger to match your conference discovery needs.\n4. **Review networking priorities** - The system automatically prioritizes speakers, but you can customize the criteria.\n\n## Technical Configuration\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Self-hosted n8n instance (version 1.0+)\n- ScrapeGraphAI API credentials\n- Eventbrite API access (optional, for enhanced data)\n\n### API Configuration\n```bash\n# ScrapeGraphAI Setup\n1. Sign up at https://scrapegraph.ai\n2. Generate API key from dashboard\n3. Add credentials in n8n: Settings &gt; Credentials &gt; Add Credential &gt; ScrapeGraphAI\n```\n\n### Customization Examples\n\n**Modify Conference Sources:**\n```javascript\n// In Eventbrite Scraper node, update the URL:\nconst targetUrl = \"https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-states/technology/\";\nconst industryFilter = \"?q=artificial+intelligence\";\n```\n\n**Adjust Networking Priorities:**\n```javascript\n// In Speaker Intelligence node, modify scoring weights:\nconst priorityWeights = {\n  executive_level: 0.4,\n  company_size: 0.3,\n  industry_relevance: 0.2,\n  speaking_topic: 0.1\n};\n```\n\n**Customize Output Format:**\n```javascript\n// In Networking Strategy node, modify output structure:\nconst outputFormat = {\n  high_priority: speakers.filter(s =&gt; s.score &gt; 8),\n  medium_priority: speakers.filter(s =&gt; s.score &gt; 6 && s.score &lt;= 8),\n  networking_plan: generateApproachStrategy(speakers)\n};\n```\n\n## Data Storage & Output Formats\n\n### Storage Options\n- **Local JSON files** - Default storage for conference data\n- **Google Drive** - For sharing reports with team\n- **Database** - PostgreSQL/MySQL for enterprise deployments\n- **Cloud Storage** - AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage\n\n### Output Formats\n- **JSON** - Raw data for API integration\n- **CSV** - For spreadsheet analysis\n- **PDF Reports** - Executive summaries\n- **Markdown** - Documentation and sharing\n\n### Sample Output Structure\n```json\n{\n  \"conference_data\": {\n    \"event_name\": \"AI Summit 2024\",\n    \"date\": \"2024-06-15\",\n    \"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\",\n    \"speakers\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Dr. Sarah Chen\",\n        \"title\": \"CTO, TechCorp\",\n        \"company\": \"TechCorp Inc\",\n        \"networking_score\": 9.2,\n        \"priority\": \"high\",\n        \"approach_strategy\": \"Connect via LinkedIn, mention shared AI interests\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"networking_plan\": {\n      \"high_priority_targets\": 5,\n      \"recommended_approach\": \"Focus on AI ethics panel speakers\",\n      \"schedule_optimization\": \"Attend morning keynotes, network during breaks\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Automated Conference Discovery** - Finds relevant industry events from multiple sources\n- **Speaker Intelligence Analysis** - Identifies high-value networking targets with contact priority scoring\n- **Strategic Agenda Mapping** - Optimizes your conference schedule for maximum networking impact\n- **AI-Powered Recommendations** - Provides personalized networking strategies and approach methods\n- **Priority Contact Lists** - Ranks speakers by business value and networking potential\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ScrapeGraphAI Rate Limits** - Implement delays between requests\n2. **Website Structure Changes** - Update scraping prompts in ScrapeGraphAI nodes\n3. **API Authentication** - Verify credentials and permissions\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- Adjust trigger frequency based on conference season\n- Implement caching for repeated data\n- Use batch processing for large conference lists\n\n## Support & Customization\n\nFor advanced customization or enterprise deployments, consider:\n- Custom speaker scoring algorithms\n- Integration with CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)\n- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards\n- Multi-language support for international conferences\n",
