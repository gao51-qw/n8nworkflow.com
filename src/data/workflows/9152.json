  "title": "Automate AI video ad generation with Google Veo 3, Gemini, and Airtable",
  "description": "## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for transforming a static product image and a creative idea into a dynamic, AI-generated video ad. \n\nUsing Google's state-of-the-art Veo 3 model, this workflow manages the entire creative process from concept to a final, downloadable video file.\n\n## Who's this workflow for?\n- E-commerce Brands & Marketers\n- Advertising Agencies\n- Social Media Content Creators\n- Product Managers\n\n## How it works\n**1. Submit a Creative Brief:** The workflow starts when a user submits a creative idea via a simple web form (e.g., \"A Pepsi can exploding into a vibrant disco party\").\n\n**2. Upload a Product Image:** The user is then prompted to upload a corresponding image (e.g., a high-quality photo of the Pepsi can).\n\n**3. Log the Project in Airtable:** The idea and the uploaded image are saved to an Airtable base, which acts as the central tracking system for all video generation projects.\n\n**4. AI Creative Analysis:** Google Gemini analyzes both the user's text prompt and the uploaded image. It acts as an \"AI Creative Director,\" generating a detailed video brief that reinterprets the static image according to the user's creative vision.\n\n**5. Generate Video with Veo 3:** The detailed creative brief is sent to Google's Veo 3 AI video generation model. The workflow initiates a long-running task to create the video.\n\n**6. Retrieve the Final Video:** After a brief waiting period, the workflow polls the Veo 3 API to retrieve the finished video, converts it into a binary file, and makes it available for download directly from the n8n execution log.\n\n## Key Requirements to Use This Template\n**n8n Instance & Required Nodes:**\n- An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).\nThis workflow uses the official n8n LangChain integration (@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain). \n- If you are using a self-hosted version of n8n, please ensure this package is installed.\n\n**Google Cloud Account:**\n- A Google Cloud Project with the Vertex AI API enabled.\n- You must have access to both the Gemini and Veo 3 models within your project.\n- You will need a Gemini API Key and a Google OAuth2 Credential configured for the Vertex AI scope.\n\n**Airtable Account:**\n- An Airtable base with a table set up to track the video projects. It should have columns for Image Prompt, Image (Attachment), Video (Attachment/URL), and Status.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Airtable Configuration (Crucial):**\n- In the Create a record, Get a record, and Update record nodes, connect your Airtable credentials and update the Base ID and Table ID to match your setup.\n- In the Uploading Image in Airtable (HTTP Request) node, you must edit the URL and the \"Authorization\" header to include your Base ID, Table ID, and Personal Access Token.\n\n**2. Google AI Configuration (Gemini & Veo):**\n- In the Analyze image (Google Gemini) node, select your Gemini API credentials.\n- In both the Generate Video Veo 3 and Get the the Video (HTTP Request) nodes: \n\n- You must replace [Project ID] and [Location] in the URLs with your own Google Cloud Project ID and region (e.g., us-central1).\n- Select your Google OAuth2 credentials for authentication.\n\n**3. Customize Video Parameters (Optional):**\n- In the Parse Request (Code) node, you can modify the JavaScript code to change video generation settings like aspectRatio, durationSeconds, and resolution.\n\n**4. Execute the Workflow:**\n- Activate the workflow. Open the Form URL from the Prompt your Idea node to start the process.\n\n## [Sample Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1brGvAKJB4PY_CClqqRVh31Kr8fY6cTLs?usp=sharing)\n\n## Connect with us\n- Website: https://www.intuz.com/services\n- Email: getstarted@intuz.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuz\n- Get Started: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/intuz\n\n## For Custom Workflow Automation\nClick here- [Get Started](https://www.intuz.com/get-started)\n\n\n",
