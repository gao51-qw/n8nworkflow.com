  "title": "Generate highly expressive audio 🎙️ using ElevenLabs v3 TTS Audio Tags",
  "description": "This workflow is an **AI-powered text-to-speech production pipeline** designed to generate highly expressive audio using **ElevenLabs v3**.\nIt automates the entire process from raw text input to final audio distribution and upload the mp3 file to Google Drive and an FTP space.\n\n---\n\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n#### 1. ✅ Cinematic-quality audio output\n\nBy combining AI-driven emotional tagging with ElevenLabs v3, the workflow produces audio that feels **acted**, not simply read.\n\n#### 2. ✅ Fully automated pipeline\n\nFrom raw text to hosted audio file, everything is handled automatically:\n\n* No manual tagging\n* No manual uploads\n* No post-processing\n\n#### 3. ✅ Multi-input flexibility\n\nThe workflow supports:\n\n* Manual testing\n* Chat-based usage\n* API/Webhook integrations\n  This makes it ideal for **apps, CMSs, games, and content platforms**.\n\n#### 4. ✅ Language-agnostic\n\nThe agent preserves the **original language** of the input text and applies tags accordingly, making it suitable for **international projects**.\n\n#### 5.✅  Consistent and correct tagging\n\nThe use of **Context7** ensures that all audio tags follow the **official ElevenLabs v3 specifications**, reducing errors and incompatibilities.\n\n#### 6. ✅ Scalable and production-ready\n\nAutomatic uploads to Drive and FTP make this workflow ready for:\n\n* Large content volumes\n* CDN delivery\n* Team collaboration\n\n#### 7.✅  Perfect for storytelling and media\n\nThe workflow is especially effective for:\n\n* Horror and cinematic storytelling\n* Audiobooks and podcasts\n* Games and immersive narratives\n* Voiceovers with emotional depth\n\n---\n\n\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. **Text Input & Processing**: The workflow accepts text input through multiple triggers - manual execution via \"Set text\" node, webhook POST requests, or chat message inputs. This text is passed to the Audio Tagger Agent.\n\n2. **AI-Powered Audio Tagging**: The Audio Tagger Agent uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to analyze the input text and intelligently insert ElevenLabs v3 audio tags. The agent follows strict rules: maintaining original meaning, adding tags for pauses, rhythm, emphasis, emotional tones, breathing, laughter, and delivery variations while keeping the output in the original language.\n\n3. **Reference Validation**: During tagging, the agent consults the Context7 MCP tool, which provides access to the official ElevenLabs v3 audio tags guide to ensure correct and consistent tag usage.\n\n4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The tagged text is sent to ElevenLabs' v3 (alpha) model, which converts it into speech using a specific voice with customized voice settings including stability, similarity boost, style, speaker boost, and speed controls.\n\n5. **Dual Output Distribution**: The generated audio file is simultaneously uploaded to two destinations: Google Drive (in a specified \"Elevenlabs\" folder) and an FTP server (BunnyCDN), ensuring the file is stored in both cloud storage platforms.\n---\n\n\n### Set Up Steps\n\n1. **Prerequisite Configuration**:\n   - Configure Anthropic API credentials for Claude Sonnet access\n   - Set up [ElevenLabs API](https://try.elevenlabs.io/ahkbf00hocnu) credentials with access to v3 (alpha) models\n   - Configure Google Drive OAuth2 credentials with access to the target folder\n   - Set up FTP credentials for BunnyCDN or alternative storage\n   - Configure Context7 MCP tool with appropriate authentication headers\n\n2. **Workflow-Specific Setup**:\n   - In the \"Set text\" node, replace \"YOUR TEXT\" with the default text you want to process (for manual execution)\n   - In the \"Upload to FTP\" node, update the path from \"/YOUR_PATH/\" to your actual FTP directory structure\n   - Verify the Google Drive folder ID points to your intended destination folder\n   - Ensure the webhook path is correctly configured for external integrations\n   - Adjust voice parameters in the ElevenLabs node if different voice characteristics are desired\n\n3. **Execution Options**:\n   - For one-time processing: Use the manual trigger and set text in the \"Set text\" node\n   - For API integration: Use the webhook endpoint to receive text via POST requests\n   - For chat-based interaction: Use the chat trigger for conversational text input\n\n---\n\n👉 [Subscribe to my new **YouTube channel**](https://youtube.com/@n3witalia).
