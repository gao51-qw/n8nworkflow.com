  "description": "This workflow allows you to send multi-step email campaigns using n8n, Gmail and Google Sheets.\n\nYou define a sequence of emails, and a list of email addresses to send them to. The first email is sent to everyone, but the later emails in the sequence are only sent if no-one has replied to the thread yet.\n\nThis means you only need to worry about replying to people who respond to your email, not chasing people who don’t.\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. A list of emails in a Google sheet. You can define extra info that will be available to your email templates (e.g. name, company, etc.)\n\n![table.png](fileId:750)\n\n2. A sequence of emails to send, plus how long to wait to send each one, e.g.\n\n- **On day 0:** “Hi, {name} — nice to meet you at the conference. Was wondering whether {company} would be interested in a quick call about X?”\n- **On day 3:** “Hi, {name}, just wanted to check in on this. Let me know if there’s any interest!”\n- **On day 7:** “{name}, just wanted to give this one last try”\n\n3. A Gmail account (although you could also swap out that part for any other email service)\n\n### How it works\n\nWhen sending the emails, n8n inserts a hidden attribute in each one that tags it as being part of the email campaign. It then regularly looks through the email threads with that tag and checks whether:\n\n1. No-one has replied yet\n2. It’s time to send the next message\n\nThe workflow doesn’t send emails on weekends.\n\n### Notes\n\n- This workflow is not intended for spam! Please use responsibly\n- You can use this workflow for multiple different campaigns by making copies of the workflow and changing the sequence / Google Sheet that it uses",
