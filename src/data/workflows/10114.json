  "description": "This n8n workflow is designed to centralize the management and tracking of customer inquiries received through multiple channels (email and web forms).\n\n**Who's it for?**\n\n*   Customer support teams\n*   Marketing teams\n*   Sales teams\n*   Small to medium-sized businesses\n*   Individuals looking to streamline customer inquiry processes\n\n**How it works / What it does**\n\nThis workflow is designed to automatically collect, process, route, and track customer inquiries from different sources.\n\n1.  **Multi-Channel Input**: The workflow listens for inquiries from both incoming emails and web form submissions.\n    *   **Email Trigger**: Monitors a specific inbox for sent emails.\n    *   **Webhook - Web Form**: Listens for web form data submitted to a designated endpoint.\n\n2.  **Data Extraction and Parsing**:\n    *   **Extract Email Content**: Extracts HTML content from incoming emails to get a clean text message.\n    *   **Parse Email Data**: Extracts relevant information from the email, such as customer name, email address, subject, message, received timestamp, source (\"email\"), and inquiry type (e.g., \"urgent\", \"billing\", \"general\") based on the subject line.\n    *   **Parse Webhook Data**: Extracts customer name, email, subject, message, received timestamp, source (\"webform\"), and inquiry type from the web form data based on the provided type or a default of \"general\".\n\n3.  **Merge Inquiries**: The parsed email and web form inquiry data are combined into a single stream for continued processing.\n\n4.  **Route by Inquiry Type**: The workflow then routes the inquiries based on the extracted `inquiryType`.\n    *   **Urgent Inquiries**: Inquiries marked as \"urgent\" are routed to a specific Slack channel for immediate alerts.\n    *   **General Inquiries**: Inquiries marked as \"general\" are notified in another Slack channel.\n    *   **Billing Inquiries**: Inquiries marked as \"billing\" are routed to the general inquiries channel, or can be customized for a separate channel if needed.\n\n5.  **Save to Google Sheets**: All inquiry data is logged into a Google Sheet, which serves as a central repository, including details like customer name, email, subject, message, source, received timestamp, and inquiry type.\n\n6.  **Send Auto-Reply Email**: Customers receive an automated email reply confirming that their inquiry has been successfully received.\n\n**How to set up**\n\n1.  **Google Sheets**:\n    *   Create a new spreadsheet in your Google Drive.\n    *   Name the first sheet \"Inquiries\" and create the following header row: `customerName`, `customerEmail`, `subject`, `message`, `source`, `receivedAt`, `inquiryType`.\n    *   In the **'Save to Google Sheets'** node, configure the Spreadsheet ID and Sheet Name. Link your Google Sheets credentials.\n\n2.  **Email Trigger (IMAP)**:\n    *   Set up the **'Email Trigger'** node to connect to your IMAP email account. Test it to ensure it correctly listens for incoming emails before activating the workflow.\n\n3.  **Webhook - Web Form**:\n    *   Copy the Webhook URL from the **'Webhook - Web Form'** node and configure your web form to submit data to it. Ensure your web form sends fields like `name`, `email`, `subject`, `message`, and `type` in JSON format.\n\n4.  **Slack**:\n    *   Configure your Slack credentials to connect to your Slack workspace.\n    *   Update the relevant Slack Channel IDs in both the **'Notify Urgent - Slack'** and **'Notify General - Slack'** nodes for sending notifications for urgent and general inquiries.\n\n5.  **Gmail**:\n    *   Set up your Gmail credentials to connect to your Gmail account.\n    *   Ensure the **'Send Auto-Reply Email'** node is correctly linked to your sending Gmail account.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n*   An n8n instance\n*   A Google Sheets account\n*   An IMAP-enabled email account\n*   A Slack workspace\n*   A Gmail account\n*   A basic web form (to integrate with the Webhook node)\n\n**How to customize the workflow**\n\n*   **Add more Inquiry Types**: You can add more specific inquiry types (e.g., \"technical support\", \"returns\") by adding more rules in the **'Route by Inquiry Type'** node.\n*   **Additional Notification Channels**: To integrate other notification systems (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Discord, SMS) beyond Slack, create new routing outputs and add new notification nodes for the desired service.\n*   **CRM Integration**: Instead of or in addition to saving data to Google Sheets, you can add new nodes to connect to CRM systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, or others.\n*   **Prioritization and Escalation**: Implement more complex logic to trigger escalation processes or prioritization rules based on inquiry type or keywords.\n*   **AI Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate an AI node to analyze the sentiment of inquiry messages and route or prioritize them accordingly.\n\n\n`",
