  "description": "# Zoho CRM - Smart Meeting Scheduler\n\nThis workflow automatically schedules meetings for new Zoho CRM leads by detecting their timezone, checking the sales rep’s Google Calendar, generating conflict-free time slots, creating a Zoom meeting and sending a personalized AI-generated email to the lead. If no slots are available, it sends a fallback message to the lead without updating Zoho CRM. When a meeting is created, all details are logged inside Zoho CRM for visibility.\n\n\n### ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps (Fast Start Guide)\n\n- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.\n- Configure Zoho CRM, Google Calendar, Gmail, Zoom OAuth and Gemini AI credentials.\n- Update meeting duration, working hours, buffer time and search window.\n- Set email recipient to the lead’s email instead of test/static values.\n- Add the webhook URL to Zoho CRM → Automation → Webhooks.\n- Test with a new lead and activate the workflow.\n\n\n## 📘 What It Does\nThis workflow automates scheduling for new Zoho CRM leads. As soon as a lead is created, it retrieves full lead and owner details, detects the lead’s timezone and checks the assigned sales rep’s upcoming Google Calendar events. This helps identify when the rep is available.\n\nUsing your settings—working hours, meeting duration, buffer before/after and days to evaluate—the system generates valid meeting time slots with no conflicts. If suitable slots exist, it authenticates with Zoom and creates a meeting for the earliest option, then generates a polished HTML invitation using Gemini AI and emails it to the lead. This ensures a fast, smart and personalized lead engagement process.\n\nIf no slots exist, the workflow sends a fallback email informing the lead that no availability is open in the next few days. In this branch, Zoho CRM is not updated, because no meeting was scheduled.\n\n\n## 🎯 Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\n- Sales teams managing high inbound volume  \n- CRM managers automating lead qualification & engagement  \n- SaaS companies scheduling demos automatically  \n- Agencies booking consultation calls  \n- Any team struggling with timezone-based scheduling manually  \n\n\n## 🔧 Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\n### Platform Requirements\n- n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)\n\n### Required Integrations\n- Zoho CRM OAuth2  \n- Google Calendar OAuth2  \n- Gmail OAuth2  \n- Zoom OAuth (account-level)  \n- Gemini AI / Google PaLM API  \n\n### Required Lead Fields\n- Email (mandatory for sending the invite)  \n- Country / State (for timezone detection)  \n- Lead Owner (to fetch rep details)  \n\n## 🔄 How It Works\n\n1. Zoho CRM Webhook triggers when a new lead is created.  \n2. Workflow fetches full lead and owner details.  \n3. Detects the lead’s timezone using country/state mapping.  \n4. Fetches the sales rep’s availability from Google Calendar.  \n5. Generates valid time slots based on working hours, buffers and meeting duration.  \n\n### If slots exist:\n\n- Authenticate with Zoom  \n- Create a Zoom meeting  \n- Generate personalized HTML invite using Gemini AI  \n- Send email to the lead  \n- Log meeting details in Zoho CRM  \n\n### If no slots exist:\n\n- Generate fallback message  \n- Send fallback email to the lead  \n- *(Zoho CRM is NOT updated in this path)*  \n\n## 🛠️ Setup Steps (Configuration Guide)\n\n### 1.

Test the Automation  \n\nVerify:\n- Correct timezone detection  \n- Calendar availability check  \n- Zoom meeting creation  \n- AI email sent to the lead  \n- Zoho CRM updated **only when meeting is created**  \n\n### 8. Activate Workflow  \n\nEnable the workflow for live operation.\n\n## 🧩 How To Customize Nodes\n\n### 1. Adjust Meeting Logic  \n\nModify the Workflow Configuration node to change:\n- Slot duration  \n- Buffer time  \n- Working hour ranges  \n- Days to consider  \n\n### 2. Expand Timezone Detection  \n\nEdit the **Detect Lead Timezone** node to add new countries/states.\n\n### 3. Personalize Email Content  \n\nUpdate the prompt inside the **Generate Personalized Invite** node.\n\n### 4.
