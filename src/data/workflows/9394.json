  "description": "# 🛠️ Workflow: Jotform → HubSpot Company + Task Automation\n\nAutomatically create or update **HubSpot companies** and generate **follow-up tasks** whenever a **Jotform** is submitted.  \nAll logs are stored to **Google Sheets** for traceability, transparency, and debugging.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Use Cases\n\n- Capture marketing queries from your website’s **Jotform form** and immediately create tasks for your **sales or SDR team**.  \n- Enrich **HubSpot companies** with submitted domains, company names, and contact data.  \n- Automatically assign tasks to owners and keep all form submissions **logged and auditable**.  \n- Avoid manual handoffs — **full automation** from form submission → CRM.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 How It Works (Step-by-Step)\n\n### **1. Jotform Trigger**\nThe workflow starts when a new submission is received via the Jotform webhook.  \nCaptured fields include: name, email, LinkedIn profile, company name, marketing budget, domain, and any specific query.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Create or Update Company in HubSpot + Format Data**\n- The **“Create Company”** node ensures the submitted company is either created in HubSpot or updated if it already exists.  \n- A **Formatter (Function)** node standardizes the data — names, email, LinkedIn URL, domain, marketing budget, and query text.  \n- It composes a task title, generates a follow-up timestamp, and dynamically assigns an owner.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Loop & HTTP Request – Create HubSpot Task**\n- The workflow loops through each formatted item.  \n- A **Wait** node prevents rate limit issues.  \n- It then sends an **HTTP POST** request to HubSpot’s Tasks API, creating a task with:\n  - Subject and body including the submission details  \n  - Task status, priority, and type  \n  - Assigned owner and associated company\n\n---\n\n### **4. Loop & HTTP Request – Set Company Domain**\nAfter tasks are created, another loop updates each HubSpot company record with the submitted **domain**.  \nThis ensures all HubSpot companies have proper website data for future enrichment.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Storing Logs (Google Sheets)**\nAll processed submissions, responses, errors, and metadata are appended or updated in a **Google Sheets** document.  \nThis provides a complete audit trail — ideal for debugging, reporting, and performance monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Node Structure Overview\n\n| Step | Node | Description |\n|------|------|--------------|\n| 1️⃣ | **Jotform Trigger** | Receives form submission data |\n| 2️⃣ | **HubSpot Create Company** | Ensures company record exists |\n| 3️⃣ | **Formatter / Function Node** | Cleans & structures data, assigns owner, generates task fields |\n| 4️⃣ | **Wait / Delay Node** | Controls API call frequency |\n| 5️⃣ | **HTTP Request (Create Task)** | Pushes task to HubSpot |\n| 6️⃣ | **HTTP Request (Update Domain)** | Updates company domain in HubSpot |\n| 7️⃣ | **Google Sheets Node** | Logs inputs, outputs, and status |\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Requirements & Setup\n\n- 🔑 **HubSpot Private App Token** with permissions to create companies, tasks, and update records  \n- 🌐 **Jotform Webhook URL** pointing to this workflow  \n- 📗 **Google Sheets Credentials** (OAuth or service account) with write access  \n- ✅ HubSpot app must have `crm.objects.companies.write` and `crm.objects.tasks.write` scopes  \n- ⚠️ Add retry or error-handling branches for failed API calls\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Customization Tips & Variations\n\n- **Add contact association:**  \n  Modify the payload to also link the task with a HubSpot Contact (via email) so it appears in both company and contact timelines.  \n\n- **Use fallback values:**  \n  In the Formatter node, provide defaults like “Unknown Company” or “No query provided.”  \n\n- **Dynamic owner assignment:**  \n  Replace hash-based assignment with round-robin or territory logic.  \n\n- **Conditional task creation:**  \n  Add logic to only create tasks when certain conditions are met (e.g., budget &gt; 0).  \n\n- **Error branches:**  \n  Capture failed HTTP responses and send Slack/Email alerts.  \n\n- **Extended logs:**  \n  Add response codes, errors, and retry counts to your Google Sheet for more transparency.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Benefits & Why You’d Use This\n\n- ⚡ **Speed & Automation** — eliminate manual data entry into HubSpot  \n- 📊 **Data Consistency** — submissions are clean, enriched, and traceable  \n- 👀 **Transparency** — every action logged for full visibility  \n- 🌍 **Scalability** — handle hundreds of submissions effortlessly  \n- 🔄 **Flexibility** — adaptable for other use cases (support tickets, surveys, partnerships, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### ✨ Example Use Case\nA marketing form on your website captures partnership or franchise inquiries.  \nThis workflow instantly creates a HubSpot company, logs the inquiry as a task, assigns it to a regional manager, and saves a record in Google Sheets — all within seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Tags:** `HubSpot` `Jotform` `CRM` `GoogleSheets` `Automation` `LeadManagement`\n",
