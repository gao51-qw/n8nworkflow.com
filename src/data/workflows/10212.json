  "description": "This automation creates a fully integrated pipeline to **generate AI-powered videos**, **store them**, and **publish them on TikTok** — all automatically.\nIt connects **OpenAI Sora 2**, and **Postiz (for TikTok publishing)** to streamline content creation.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Benefits**\n\n✅ **Full Automation** – From text prompt to TikTok upload, everything happens automatically with no manual intervention once set up.\n✅ **Centralized Control** – Google Sheets acts as a simple dashboard to manage prompts, durations, and generated results.\n✅ **AI-Powered Creativity** – Uses **OpenAI Sora 2** for realistic video generation and **GPT-5** for optimized titles.\n✅ **Social Media Integration** – Seamlessly posts videos to **TikTok** via **Postiz**, ready for your audience.\n✅ **Scalable & Customizable** – Can easily be extended to other platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or LinkedIn.\n✅ **Time-Saving** – Eliminates repetitive steps like manual video uploads or caption writing.\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\nThis workflow automates the end-to-end process of generating AI videos and publishing them to TikTok. It is triggered either manually or on a recurring schedule.\n\n1.  **Trigger & Data Fetch:** The workflow starts by checking a specified Form for new entries. It looks for rows where a video has been requested (a \"PROMPT\" is filled) but not yet generated (the \"VIDEO\" column is empty).\n\n2.  **AI Video Generation:** For each new prompt found, the workflow sends a request to the **Fal.ai Sora 2** model to generate a video. It then enters a polling loop, repeatedly checking the status of the generation request every 60 seconds until the video is \"COMPLETED\".\n\n3.  **Post-Processing & Upload:** Once the video is ready, the workflow performs several actions in parallel:\n    *   **Fetch Video & Store:** It retrieves the final video URL, downloads the video file\n    *   **Generate Title:** It uses the **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** model to analyze the original prompt and generate an optimized, engaging title for the video.\n    *   **Publish to TikTok:** The video file is uploaded to **Postiz**, a social media scheduling tool, which then automatically publishes it to a connected TikTok channel, using the AI-generated title as the post's caption.\n\n---\n### Set up steps\n\nTo make this workflow functional, you need to complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**\n    *   Create a Form with at least \"PROMPT\", \"DURATION\", and \"VIDEO\" fields.\n\n2.  **Configure Fal.ai for Video Generation:**\n    *   Create an account at [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain your API key.\n    *   In both the **\"Create Video\"** and **\"Get status\"** HTTP Request nodes, set up the \"Header Auth\" credential.\n    *   Set the `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.\n\n3.  **Set up TikTok Publishing via Postiz:**\n    *   Create an account on [Postiz](https://postiz.com/) and connect your TikTok account to get a **Channel ID**.\n    *   Obtain your Postiz API key.\n    *   In the **\"Upload Video to Postiz\"** and **\"TikTok\" (Postiz)** nodes, configure the API credentials.\n    *   In the **\"TikTok\"** node, replace the placeholder `\"XXX\"` in the `integrationId` field with your actual TikTok Channel ID from Postiz.\n\n4.  **(Optional) Configure AI Title Generation:**\n    *   The **\"Generate title\"** node uses OpenAI. Ensure you have valid OpenAI API credentials configured in n8n for this node to work.\n\n---\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n## Header 2",
