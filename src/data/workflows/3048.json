  "description": "## **Overview**  \nThe **n8n Workflow Cloner** is a powerful automation tool designed to **copy, sync, and migrate workflows** across different n8n instances or projects. Whether you're managing multiple environments (development, staging, production) or organizing workflows within a team, this workflow **automates the transfer process**, ensuring seamless workflow deployment with minimal manual effort.  \n\nBy automatically detecting and copying only the missing workflows, this tool helps **maintain consistency, improve collaboration, and streamline workflow migration** between projects or instances.  \n\n## **How to Use**  \n\n### 1️⃣ **Set Up API Credentials**  \n- Configure API credentials for both **source** and **destination** n8n instances.  \n- Ensure the credentials have **read and write** access to manage workflows.  \n\n### 2️⃣ **Select Source & Destination**  \n- Update the **\"GET - Workflows\"** node to define the **source instance**.  \n- Set the **\"CREATE - Workflow\"** node to specify the **destination instance**.  \n\n### 3️⃣ **Run the Workflow**  \n- Click **\"Test Workflow\"** to start the transfer.  \n- The system will fetch all workflows from the source, **compare** them with the destination, and copy any missing workflows.  \n\n### 4️⃣ **Change the Destination Project** (Optional)  \n- By default, workflows are moved to the **\"KBB Workflows\"** project.  \n- Modify the **\"Filter\"** node to transfer workflows to a different project.  \n\n### 5️⃣ **Monitor & Verify**  \n- The **Loop Over Items** node ensures batch processing for multiple workflows.  \n- Log outputs provide details on transferred workflows and statuses.  \n\n## **Key Benefits**  \n✅ **Automate Workflow Transfers** – No more manual exports/imports.  \n✅ **Sync Workflows Across Environments** – Keep workflows up to date in dev, staging, and production.  \n✅ **Effortless Team Collaboration** – Share workflows across projects seamlessly.  \n✅ **Backup & Migration Ready** – Easily move workflows between n8n instances.  \n\n## **Use Cases**  \n🔹 **CI/CD for Workflows** – Deploy workflows between development and production environments.  \n🔹 **Team Workflow Sharing** – Share workflows across multiple n8n projects.  \n🔹 **Workflow Backup Solution** – Store copies of workflows in a dedicated backup project.  \n\n## **Tags**  \n🚀 Workflow Migration  \n🚀 n8n Automation  \n🚀 Sync Workflows  \n🚀 Backup & Deployment  \n",
