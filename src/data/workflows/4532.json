  "description": "## Who is this for?\nThis workflow is intended for users, workers, creatives or students who want to translate languages ​​​​quickly and automatically via text chat. translating a sentence will take time and seem impractical, with this the results will be practical and save time. This is also a form of devotion to the community at n8n and the n8n company, as well as devotion to users and students so that reality is no longer tiring and is able to answer the problems of existing reality.\n\n## How does it work?\nEasy explanation:\n\nTrigger Chat functions as a place or container for inputting text or sentences to be translated and the results come out directly here. Then the DeepL node will become the translation machine, here there are already parameters, the language can be adjusted, and the last node is useful for after the DeepL node no more operations appear And enjoy this workflow that suits you.\n\n## Setup instructions\nComplete what is in the node as stated in the notes column.\nYou need a \"Credential Account\" on the DeepL node, then select the language. If you already have an account, just connect it, and if not, create it first, you can register it by following the guide from n8n, it's very easy.\nBecause here it is neatly and cleanly arranged. Then, save and run, test the workflow and activate the workflow. This workflow is ready to use.\n\n## Requirements\nAs a reminder:\n\nThere must be (if not, make sure it is registered) in each \"Credential Account\" by following the guide on how to create it, n8n's guide is very complete\nDon't forget to save, and make sure the workflow is active.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\nYou can directly set the parameters in the language, so that the suitability is also high when working on tasks and answering them.",
