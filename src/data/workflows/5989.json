  "description": "In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up an AI-driven workflow that automatically processes highly-rated food photos from a Google Sheet, generates AI-powered captions, shares them to Pinterest, and updates the sheet to reflect the posts. Ready to automate your food photo sharing? Let’s dive in!\n\n## What’s the Goal?\n- Automatically detect and process highly-rated food photos (4 stars or above) from a Google Sheet.\n- Use AI to generate engaging and relevant captions.\n- Share the photos with captions to Pinterest via the Pinterest API.\n- Update the Google Sheet to mark photos as posted.\n- Enable scheduled automation for consistent posting.\n\nBy the end, you’ll have a self-running system that shares your best food photos effortlessly.\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\nManual photo sharing is time-consuming and inconsistent. Here’s why this workflow is a game changer:\n\n- **Zero Human Error**: AI ensures consistent captions and posting accuracy.\n- **Time-Saving Automation**: Automatically handle photo sharing, boosting efficiency.\n- **Scheduled Posting**: Maintain a regular presence on Pinterest without manual effort.\n- **Focus on Creativity**: Free your team from repetitive posting tasks.\nThink of it as your tireless social media assistant that keeps your Pinterest feed vibrant.\n\n## How It Works\nHere’s the step-by-step magic behind the automation:\n\n### Step 1: Trigger the Workflow\n- Detect new photos to post using the Daily Post Scheduler node (e.g., once daily).\n- Initiate the workflow at a scheduled time to check for new food photos.\n\n### Step 2: Fetch Food Photos from Sheet\n- Retrieve rows from the Google Sheet that contain food photo metadata like image URLs, ratings, and status.\n\n### Step 3: Filter 4+ Star Dishes\n- Filter only those food entries with high ratings (4 stars or above) and unposted status.\n\n### Step 4: AI Caption Generator\n- Use AI (e.g., GPT/OpenAI) to create engaging and relevant captions for selected food photos.\n\n### Step 5: Upload to Pinterest\n- Automatically post the food photo with the generated caption to Pinterest via the Pinterest API.\n\n### Step 6: Mark as Posted in Sheet\n- Update the Google Sheet to reflect that the photo has been successfully shared.\n\n## How to Use the Workflow?\nImporting a workflow in n8n is a straightforward process that allows you to use pre-built workflows to save time. Below is a step-by-step guide to importing the Automated Food Photo Sharing workflow in n8n.\n\n### Steps to Import a Workflow in n8n\n\n1. **Obtain the Workflow JSON**\n   - **Source the Workflow**: Workflows are shared as JSON files or code snippets, e.g., from the n8n community, a colleague, or exported from another n8n instance.\n   - **Format**: Ensure you have the workflow in JSON format, either as a file (e.g., workflow.json) or copied text.\n\n2. **Access the n8n Workflow Editor**\n   - Log in to n8n (via n8n Cloud or self-hosted instance).\n   - Navigate to the Workflows tab in the n8n dashboard.\n   - Click Add Workflow to create a blank workflow.\n\n3. **Import the Workflow**\n   - **Option 1: Import via JSON Code (Clipboard)**:\n     - Click the three dots (⋯) in the top-right corner to open the menu.\n     - Select Import from Clipboard.\n     - Paste the JSON code into the text box.\n     - Click Import to load the workflow.\n   - **Option 2: Import via JSON File**:\n     - Click the three dots (⋯) in the top-right corner.\n     - Select Import from File.\n     - Choose the .json file from your computer.\n     - Click Open to import.\n\n### Setup Notes\n- **Google Sheet Columns**: Ensure your Google Sheet includes the following columns: `Image URL`, `Rating` (numeric, e.g., 1-5), `Feedback` (text), `Pin Title`, `Pin Description`, `Destination URL`, `Board ID`, and `Status` (e.g., \"Pending\" or \"Posted\").\n- **Google Sheets Credentials**: Configure OAuth2 settings in the Fetch Food Photos node with your Google Sheet ID and credentials.\n- **AI Model**: Set up the AI Caption Generator node with OpenAI credentials (e.g., API key).\n- **Pinterest API**: Authorize the Upload to Pinterest node with Pinterest API credentials (e.g., Bearer Token) and obtain the Board ID.\n- **Scheduling**: Adjust the Daily Post Scheduler node to your preferred posting time (e.g., daily at 9 AM).",
