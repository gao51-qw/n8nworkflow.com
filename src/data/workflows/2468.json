  "description": "This n8n template is designed to assist and improve customer support team member capacity by automating the resolution of long-lived and forgotten JIRA issues.\n\n## How it works\n\n* Schedule Trigger runs daily to check for long-lived unresolved issues and imports them into the workflow.\n* Each Issue is handled as a separate subworkflow by using an execute workflow node. This allows parallel processing.\n* A report is generated from the issue using its comment history allowing the issue to be classified by AI - determining the state and progress of the issue.\n* If determined to be resolved, sentiment analysis is performed to track customer satisfaction. If negative, a slack message is sent to escalate, otherwise the issue is closed automatically.\n* If no response has been initiated, an AI agent will attempt to search and resolve the issue itself using similar resolved issues or from the notion database. If a solution is found, it is posted to the issue and closed.\n* If the issue is blocked and waiting for responses, then a reminder message is added.\n\n## How to use\n\n* This template searches for JIRA issues which are older than 7 days which are not in the \"Done\" status. Ensure there are some issues that meet this criteria otherwise adjust the search query to suit.\n* Works best if you frequently have long-lived issues that need resolving.\n* Ensure the notion tool is configured as to not read documents you didn't intend it to ie. private and/or internal documentation.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* JIRA for issues management\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Slack for notifications\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n* Why not try classifying issues as they are created? One use-case may be for quality control such as ensuring reporting criteria is adhered to, summarising and rephrasing issue for easier reading or adjusting priority.",
