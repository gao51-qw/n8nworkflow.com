  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for YouTubers who want to update their video descriptions in bulk without manually editing each one. It's especially useful for creators who include a standard set of links in their descriptions and need to insert a new link between existing ones across multiple videos.\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nManually updating video descriptions for multiple videos can be tedious and time-consuming. If you have a section in your video descriptions that contains important links, adding a new one in a specific position (e.g., between two existing links) can be a challenge. This workflow automates that process, allowing you to insert a specific string between two predefined rows in all of your video descriptions at once.\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. Fetches all videos from your YouTube channel.\n2. Iterates through each video to retrieve its existing description.\n3. Identifies two predefined rows in the description.\n4. Inserts a new row between the two specified rows.\n5. Updates the video description with the modified text.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Connect your YouTube account to n8n and grant necessary permissions.\n2. Define your variables in the \"Set String to Insert\" node:\n   - **rowBefore**: The existing row after which the new row will be inserted.\n   - **rowToInsert**: The new text or link to insert.\n   - **rowAfter**: The existing row before which the new row will be inserted.\n3. Run the workflow using the manual trigger.\n4. Review the updated descriptions to ensure accuracy.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Change the insertion criteria** by modifying the rowBefore and rowAfter values.\n- **Insert multiple rows** by adjusting the JavaScript code in the Code node.\n- **Extend the workflow** by adding conditions (e.g., only updating descriptions of videos with certain tags).\n- **Filter specific** videos instead of updating all by modifying the \"Get All Videos\" node.\n\nThis workflow ensures that all your YouTube descriptions stay updated and consistent with minimal effort.",
