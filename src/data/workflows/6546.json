  "description": "## 📌 What It Does  \nThis workflow connects a Telegram bot with your ClickUp workspace, allowing you to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** tasks just by sending a message. The AI agent interprets natural language commands and takes the appropriate action — all without needing to open ClickUp.\n\nIt’s like having a personal assistant inside Telegram that manages your task list for you.\n\n## ✅ Prerequisites  \nTo use this workflow, you'll need the following credentials set up in n8n:\n- **Telegram Bot API Credential** (used in all Telegram nodes)  \n- **ClickUp OAuth2 Credential** (for task operations)  \n- **OpenAI Credential** (to power the AI agent that parses your commands)\n\n## ⚠️ Before First Use  \nMake sure to **add your bot's user ID** to the `Ignore Bot Messages` node.  \nThis prevents infinite loops caused by the bot responding to its own messages.\n\nIf you're unsure of your bot's ID:\n1. Temporarily disable the two Telegram tool nodes connected to the AI Agent.\n2. Send a test message from the bot and capture its ID.\n3. Add that ID to the ignore filter, then re-enable the nodes.\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works  \n1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts when your Telegram bot receives a message.  \n2. **Ignore Self:** If the message was sent by the bot itself, the workflow stops.  \n3. **AI Analysis:** The message is passed to an AI agent (OpenAI) that determines what action to take.  \n4. **Decision Tree:**\n   - 📌 Create a new task in ClickUp  \n   - ✏️ Update an existing task  \n   - 🔍 Find a task and return its details  \n   - 🗑️ Delete a task  \n   - ❓ Ask for more details if input is unclear  \n   - ✅ Send confirmation or feedback to the user  \n\n## 💡 Example Use Cases  \n- “Add a task called ‘Follow up with supplier’ for tomorrow.”  \n- “What tasks are due this week?”  \n- “Update the task ‘Website Launch’ to ‘in progress’.”  \n- “Delete the task ‘Old client notes’.”  \n\nThis workflow is ideal for solo operators, remote teams, or anyone who wants to manage ClickUp while on the go — without switching apps.\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions  \n1. **Telegram Bot:**\n   - Create a Telegram bot using BotFather  \n   - Add your **Telegram credential** to all Telegram nodes in this workflow  \n2. **Bot ID Filter:**\n   - Add your **bot’s Telegram user ID** to the `Ignore Bot Messages` node  \n3. **OpenAI Setup:**\n   - Add your **OpenAI credential** to the AI Agent node  \n4. **ClickUp Integration:**\n   - Connect your **ClickUp credential**  \n   - Set your **workspace, list, and folder IDs** in the task creation and search nodes  \n\n## 🚀 How to Use  \n1. Save the Telegram bot to your contacts  \n2. Open the Telegram chat with your bot and send a message like:  \n   `\"Add a task to follow up with invoices every Friday\"`  \n3. The bot will reply with confirmation or ask for clarification  \n4. The task will appear in your ClickUp workspace within seconds  \n\n## 🔧 Customization Options  \n- Add new intents to the AI agent to support more actions (e.g., time tracking or comments)  \n- Customize the bot’s responses for branding or tone  \n- Add notifications or reminders using additional Telegram nodes  \n\n## ✨ Why It's Useful  \nThis workflow eliminates the friction of switching between Telegram and your task manager. It reduces manual data entry, saves time, and gives you a simple way to manage your to-do list using natural language — even on mobile.\n\nPerfect for freelancers, managers, or team leads who want a faster, more intuitive way to stay organized.\n",
