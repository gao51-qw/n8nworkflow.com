  "description": "# SignSnapHome to Multi-CRM Auto Follow-up: Complete Real Estate Open House Automation\n\n## Transform Your Open House Leads into Clients with Zero Manual Work\n\nAre you tired of manually entering open house visitor information into your CRM? Losing hot leads because you didn't follow up fast enough? This powerful n8n workflow automatically syncs every [SignSnapHome](https://signsnaphome.com) open house sign-in to **three major real estate CRMs** and executes a customizeable 7-day follow-up sequence via email and SMS.\n\n[Setup Video Here](https://youtu.be/1l0E_r333go)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What This Workflow Does\n\nThis automation creates a complete, hands-free lead nurturing system for real estate agents using SignSnap Home for open house visitor management. Every time someone signs in at your open house, this workflow:\n\n1. **Instantly captures** all visitor data from SignSnap Home via webhook\n2. **Intelligently scores** each lead based on agent status and property interest\n3. **Automatically syncs** contact information to three CRMs simultaneously:\n   - **HubSpot** - For marketing automation and pipeline management\n   - **Follow Up Boss** - For real estate-specific lead management\n   - **Monday.com** - For team collaboration and task tracking\n4. **Logs everything** to Google Sheets for complete audit trail and reporting\n5. **Sends personalized follow-ups** over 7 days for qualified leads:\n   - **Day 0**: Immediate thank you email\n   - **Day 2**: SMS text message check-in\n   - **Day 5**: Market update email with consultation offer\n   - **Day 7**: Automatic task created in HubSpot for agent to call\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Key Features\n\n### Smart Lead Qualification\nNot all open house visitors are equal.
