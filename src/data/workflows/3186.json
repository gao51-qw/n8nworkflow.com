  "description": "### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is tailored for content creators, artists, and developers who use Ko-fi to receive financial support through donations, subscriptions, or product sales.\n\n###  Use case\nThis workflow automates the process of receiving and categorizing payment notifications from Ko-fi, ensuring that creators can focus on their work rather than administrative tasks. \n\n### What this workflow does\n- **Webhook Reception**: The workflow listens for incoming payment notifications from Ko-fi via a configured webhook.\n- **Token Verification**: It validates incoming requests to ensure they originate from Ko-fi using a verification token for enhanced security.\n- **Type Differentiation**: It categorizes payments into types—donations, subscriptions, and shop orders—allowing for tailored handling for each payment type.\n- **Custom Response Options**: Depending on the payment type received, the workflow activates specific actions or processes, enabling seamless integration with other applications or services.\n\n### Setup\n1. **Webhook Configuration**:\n   - Access the `Webhook` node within the workflow and take note of your unique webhook URL. \n   - Visit your Ko-fi webhooks management page at [Ko-fi Webhooks Management](https://ko-fi.com/manage/webhooks) and input this URL.\n\n2. **Verification Token Setup**:\n   - In your Ko-fi account, locate the verification token in the advanced settings.\n   - Input this token in the `Prepare` node of your n8n workflow.\n\n3. **Enable the Workflow**:\n   - Activate the workflow in n8n to start listening for incoming webhook notifications.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Use the test feature in the Ko-fi webhooks settings to send a test webhook to ensure everything is functioning as expected.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- **Add Actions for Each Payment Type**: You can modify the `Donation`, `Subscription`, and `Shop Order` nodes to include actions such as sending emails, logging payments within a database, or triggering notifications.\n  \n- **Enhance Security Measures**: You can further refine the `Check token` node to include additional checks or to log all incoming webhook requests for monitoring.\n\n- **Integration with Other Services**: Consider linking this workflow with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) or CRM tools to keep your supporters informed or to manage relationships more effectively.\n\n- **Custom Fields**: If needed, adjust the fields captured in the `Subscription` and `Shop Order` nodes to include more data or different parameters based on your specific use case.",
