  "description": "\nThis template can be used to **find the content gaps in PDF documents** using the **[InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com) / GraphRAG text representation** and then **generate ideas / questions / AI prompts** that bridge those gaps based on optimizing the knowledge graph's structure.\n\nSimply **upload several PDF files** (research papers, corporate or market reports, etc) and **generate an idea in seconds**. \n\nThe template is **useful for:**\n\n- generating ideas / questions for research\n- generating  content ideas based on competitors' discourse\n- finding blind spots in any discourse and generating ideas that address them.\n- avoiding the generic bias of LLM models and focusing on what's important in your particular context\n\n\n\n## What are Content Gaps and Knowledge Graphs? \n\nKnowledge graphs represent any text as a network: the main concepts are the nodes, their co-occurrences are the connections between them. \n\nBased on this representation, we build a graph and apply network science metrics to rank the most important nodes (concepts) that serve as the crossroads of meaning and also the main topical clusters that they connect. \n\nNaturally, some of the clusters will be disconnected and will have gaps between them. These are the topics (groups of concepts) that exist in this context (the documents you uploaded) but that are not very well connected. \n\nAddressing those gaps can help you see which groups of concepts you could connect with your own ideas. This is exactly what [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) does: builds the structure, finds the gaps, then uses the built-in AI to generate research questions and ideas that bridge those gaps.\n\n![InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-structural-gaps-ideas.jpg)\n\n\n## How it works\n\n1) Step 1: First, you **upload your PDF files** using an online web form, which you can run from n8n or even make publicly available. \n\n2) Steps 2-4: The documents are processed using the Code and PDF to Text nodes to **extract plain text** from them.\n\n3) Step 5: This text is then sent to the **InfraNodus GraphRAG** node that creates a knowledge graph, identifies **structural gaps** in this graph, and then uses built-in AI to generate **ideas** or research **questions / prompts** (if you use the *InfraNodus question module* instead).\n\n4) Step 6: The ideas are then **shown to the user** in the same web form. \n\nOptionally, you can hook this template to your own workflow and send the idea / question generated to your own AI model / agent for further processing. \n\nIf you'd like to sync this workflow to PDF files in a Google Drive folder, you can copy our [Google Drive PDF processing workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/4486-upload-google-drive-files-to-an-infranodus-graph/) for n8n.\n\n## How to use\n\nYou need an [InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) to use this workflow. \n\n- Create an InfraNodus account\n- Get the API key at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access) and create a Bearer authorization key.\n- Add this key into the InfraNodus GraphRAG HTTP node(s) you use in this workflow.\n- You do not need any OpenAI keys for this to work.\n\nOptionally, you can change the settings in the Step 4 of this workflow and enforce it to always use the biggest gap it identifies.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- An [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) account and API key\n\nNote: OpenAI key is not required. You will have direct access to the InfraNodus AI with the API key.\n\n\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n\nYou can use this same workflow with a Telegram bot or Slack (to be notified of the summaries and ideas). \n\nYou can also hook up automated social media content creation workflows in the end of this template, so you can generate posts that are relevant (covering the important topics in your niche) but also novel (because they connect them in a new way). \n\nCheck out our **n8n templates** for ideas at [https://n8n.io/creators/infranodus/](https://n8n.io/creators/infranodus/)\n\n\nAlso check the **full tutorial** with a **conceptual explanation** at [https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20454382597916-Beat-Your-Competition-Target-Their-Content-Gaps-with-this-n8n-Automation-Workflow](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20454382597916-Beat-Your-Competition-Target-Their-Content-Gaps-with-this-n8n-Automation-Workflow) \n\nAlso check out the **video introduction to InfraNodus** to better understand how knowledge graphs and content gaps work:\n\n[![Video tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8SAYDf9P7yg/sddefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SAYDf9P7yg)\n\nFor **support and help** with this workflow, please, contact us at [https://support.noduslabs.com](https://support.noduslabs.com)\n\n",
