  "description": "\nThis workflow automates the process of generating **AI-powered video from image** and then generates a video that is uploaded to **Google Drive**. \n\nThis workflow is a powerful tool for automating the creation of AI-generated videos from images, saving time and ensuring a seamless process from input to final output.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to create videos from images using AI and manage the generated content. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Form Submission**:\n   - The workflow starts with a **Form Trigger** node, where users submit a form with the following fields:\n     - **Description**: The text description for the video.\n     - **Duration (in seconds)**: The length of the video.\n     - **Aspect Ratio**: The aspect ratio of the video (e.g., 16:9, 9:16, 1:1).\n     - **Image URL**: The URL of the image to be used for video generation.\n\n![](https://n3wstorage.b-cdn.net/n3witalia/imagetovideo_input.webp)\n\n\n2. **Set Data**:\n   - The **Set Data** node organizes the form inputs into a structured format for further processing.\n\n3. **Create Video**:\n   - The **Create Video** node sends a POST request to generate the video.\n   - The request includes the description, image URL, duration, and aspect ratio.\n\n4. **Wait and Check Status**:\n   - The **Wait 60 sec.** node pauses the workflow for 60 seconds to allow the video generation process to complete.\n   - The **Get Status** node checks the status of the video generation by querying the API.\n\n5. **Completed?**:\n   - The **Completed?** node checks if the video generation is complete. If not, the workflow loops back to wait and check again.\n\n6. **Retrieve and Upload Video**:\n   - Once the video is generated, the **Get Url Video** node retrieves the video URL.\n   - The **Get File Video** node downloads the video file.\n   - The **Upload Video** node uploads the video to a specified folder in **Google Drive**.\n\n[Watch the resulting video](https://n3wstorage.b-cdn.net/n3witalia/imagetovideo_output.mp4)\n\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **API Key**:\n   - Create an account on account and obtain your **API Key**.\n   - In the **Create Video** node, set up **HTTP Header Authentication**:\n     - **Name**: `Authorization`\n     - **Value**: `Key YOURAPIKEY`\n\n2. **Google Drive Integration**:\n   - Set up **Google Drive** credentials in n8n for the **Upload Video** node.\n   - Specify the folder ID in Google Drive where the generated videos will be uploaded.\n\n3. **Form Configuration**:\n   - The **Form Trigger** node is pre-configured with fields for:\n     - **Description**: The text description for the video.\n     - **Duration (in seconds)**: The length of the video.\n     - **Aspect Ratio**: Choose between 16:9, 9:16, or 1:1.\n     - **Image URL**: The URL of the image to be used for video generation.\n   - Customize the form fields if needed.\n\n4. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Submit the form with the required details (description, duration, aspect ratio, and image URL).\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Generate the video using the API.\n     - Check the status until the video is ready.\n     - Upload the video to Google Drive.\n\n5. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more aspect ratio options.\n     - Sending notifications when the video is ready.\n     - Integrating with other storage services (e.g., Dropbox, AWS S3).\n\n",
