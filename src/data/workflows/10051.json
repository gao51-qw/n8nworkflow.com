  "description": "# ## Podcast on Autopilot — Generate Podcast Ideas, Scripts & Audio Automatically with Eleven Labs, GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.0\n\nBring your solo podcast to life — on full autopilot. This workflow uses GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet to turn a single topic input into a complete podcast episode intro and ready-to-send audio file.\n\n## How it works\n\nStart a chat trigger – enter a seed idea or topic (e.g., “habits,” “failure,” “technology and purpose”).\n\nPodcast Idea Agent (GPT-5) instantly crafts a thought-provoking, Rogan- or Bartlett-style episode concept with a clear angle and takeaway.\n\nPodcast Script Agent (Claude 4.0 Sonnet) expands that idea into a natural, engaging 60-second opening monologue ready for recording.\n\nText-to-Speech via ElevenLabs automatically converts the script into a high-quality voice track.\n\nEmail automation sends the finished MP3 directly to your inbox.\n\n## Perfect for\n• Solo creators who want to ideate, script and voice short podcasts effortlessly\n• Content teams prototyping daily or weekly audio snippets\n• Anyone testing AI-driven storytelling pipelines\n\n\n## Customization tips\n• Swap ElevenLabs with your preferred TTS service by editing the HTTP Request node.\n• Adjust prompt styles for tone or audience in the Idea and Script Agents.\n• Modify the Gmail (or other mail service) node to send audio to any destination (Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.).\n• For reuse at scale, add variables for episode number, guest name, or theme category — just clone and update the trigger node.\n\n## Watch step-by-step tutorial (how to build it yourself)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dan3_W1JoqU\n\n## Requirements & disclaimer\n• Requires API keys for OpenAI + Anthropic + ElevenLabs (or your chosen TTS).\n• You’re responsible for managing costs incurred through AI or TTS usage.\n• Avoid sharing sensitive or private data as input into prompt flows.\n• Designed with modularity so you can turn off or swap/deep-link any stage (idea → script → voice → email) without breaking the chain.",
