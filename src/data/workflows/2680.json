  "description": "#### Overview:\nThis workflow is designed to handle user inputs via a webhook, process the inputs with the Google Gemini API (specifically the **gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219** model), and return a structured response to the user. The response includes three key elements: reasoning, the final answer, and citation URLs (if applicable). This workflow provides a robust solution for integrating AI reasoning into your processes.\n\nThis workflow can be utilized as a tool for AI-based agents, intelligent email drafting systems, or as a standalone intelligent automation solution.\n\n---\n\n#### Setup:\n1. **Webhook Configuration:**\n   - Ensure the webhook node is properly set up to accept GET requests with an `input` parameter.\n   - Verify that the webhook path matches your application requirements.\n   - Test the webhook using tools like Postman to ensure proper data formatting.\n\n2. **Google Gemini API Credentials:**\n   - Set up your Google Gemini API account credentials in the HTTP Request node.\n   - Ensure API access and permissions are valid.\n\n3. **Parameter Adjustments:**\n   - Customize the `temperature`, `topK`, `topP`, and `maxOutputTokens` parameters to fit your use case.\n\n---\n\n#### Customization:\n1. **Input Parameters:**\n   - Modify the webhook path or parameters based on the data your application will send.\n\n2. **Response Formatting:**\n   - Adjust the JavaScript code in the \"Process API Response\" node to fit your desired output structure.\n\n3. **Output Expectations:**\n   - Test the response returned by the \"Return Response to User\" node to ensure it meets your application requirements.\n\n---\n\n#### Workflow Steps:\n\n1. **Receive User Input:**\n   - **Node Type:** Webhook\n   - **Purpose:** Captures a GET request containing a user-provided `input` parameter. Acts as the starting point for the workflow.\n\n2. **Send Request to Google Gemini:**\n   - **Node Type:** HTTP Request\n   - **Purpose:** Sends the received `input` to the Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219 model for processing. The API configuration includes parameters for customizing the response.\n\n3. **Process API Response:**\n   - **Node Type:** Code Node\n   - **Purpose:** Extracts reasoning, the final answer, and citation URLs from the API response. Organizes the output for further use.\n\n4. **Return Response to User:**\n   - **Node Type:** Respond to Webhook\n   - **Purpose:** Sends the processed and structured response back to the user via the webhook. Ensures the response format meets expectations.\n\n---\n\n#### Expected Outcomes:\n- **Input Handling:** Successfully captures user input via a webhook.\n- **AI Processing:** Generates a structured response using the **Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219** model, including reasoning, answers, and citations (if available).\n- **Output Delivery:** Returns a user-friendly response formatted to your specifications.\n\n---\n\n#### Notes:\n- The workflow is inactive by default.\n- Each node is annotated with a Sticky Note to clarify its purpose.\n- Ensure all API credentials are correctly configured before execution.\n- Use this workflow to save time, improve accuracy, and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.\n\n---\n\n#### Tags:\n- Automation\n- Google Gemini\n- AI Agents\n- Intelligent Automation\n- Content Generation\n- Workflow Integration\n\n",
