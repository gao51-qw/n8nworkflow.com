  "description": "## How It Works\nAutomates monthly payroll processing and tax compliance by calculating employee payroll, applying accurate withholdings, generating comprehensive tax summaries, and producing compliance-ready documentation. The system fetches revenue and payroll data, performs detailed payroll calculations, applies AI-driven tax withholding rules, aggregates tax summary information, and verifies compliance using GPT-4 tax analysis. It generates structured HTML documents, converts them to PDF format, stores records in Google Sheets for audit trails, archives files to Google Drive, and sends summaries to tax agents. Designed for HR departments and payroll processing teams seeking automated, accurate, and fully compliant payroll management.\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. Connect payroll data source and configure revenue fetch parameters.\n2. Set up OpenAI GPT-4 API for tax withholding logic and compliance analysis.\n3. Configure Google Sheets for audit storage and Google Drive for long-term archiving.\n4. Define tax withholding rules, compliance thresholds, and tax agent.\n\n## Prerequisites\nPayroll data source; OpenAI API key; Google Sheets and Drive accounts \n\n## Use Cases\nHR departments automating monthly payroll processing and tax compliance;\n \n## Customization\nAdjust withholding rules by jurisdiction \n\n## Benefits\nEliminates manual payroll calculations ",
