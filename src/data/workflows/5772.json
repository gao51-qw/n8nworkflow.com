  "description": "# Trump-o-meter: Extract and Evaluate Truth Social Posts\n\n## Use Case\n\nAutomatically extracting posts from Donald Trump's Truth Social account and estimating their potential impact on the U.S. stock market enables teams to monitor high-profile communications that may influence financial markets. This automation streamlines intelligence gathering for analysts, traders, and policy observers.\n\n## What This Automation Does\n\nThis automation retrieves up to 3 posts from Donald Trump's Truth Social profile and outputs structured information including:\n\n* Author name\n* Image URL\n* Post text\n* Post URL\n* Estimated stock market impact:\n\n  * Direction: positive, negative, or neutral\n  * Magnitude: None, Small, Medium, Large\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Creates a browser session on Truth Social using an Airtop profile.\n2. Navigates to `https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump`.\n3. Uses a natural language prompt with a defined JSON schema to extract structured data for up to 3 posts.\n4. Splits the results into individual post items.\n5. Filters posts that contain actual content and have a non-zero estimated market impact.\n6. Sends selected posts and impact summaries to a Slack channel.\n7. Terminates the browser session to clean up.\n\n## Setup Requirements\n\n1. [Airtop API Key](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys) — free to generate.\n2. An [Airtop Profile](https://portal.airtop.ai/browser-profiles) that is connected and logged into Truth Social.\n3. A Slack workspace and authorized app with write permissions to a target channel.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* **Integrate with Trading Signals**: Link output to financial alert systems or dashboards for timely insights.\n* **Expand Monitoring**: Extend to other high-impact accounts (e.g., politicians, CEOs).\n* **Enhance Analysis**: Add sentiment scoring or topic classification for deeper context.\n\n## Legal Disclaimer\nThis tool is intended solely for informational and analytical purposes. The market impact estimations provided are speculative and should not be construed as financial advice. **Do not make investment decisions based on this automation.** Always consult with a licensed financial advisor before making any trades.\n\n\nRead more about [Trump-o-meter automation](https://www.airtop.ai/automations/trump-o-meter-extract-and-evaluate-truth-social-posts-n8n)",
