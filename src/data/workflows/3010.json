  "description": "## 📄✨ Easy WordPress Content Creation from PDF Docs + Human in the Loop Gmail\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of transforming PDF documents into engaging, SEO-friendly WordPress blog posts. It incorporates AI-powered text analysis, automatic image generation, and a human review step to ensure quality before publishing.\n\n## 🚀 How It Works\n\n### 🗂️ PDF Upload & Text Extraction  \n- Users upload a PDF document through a form trigger.  \n- The workflow extracts text from the uploaded file, ensuring compatibility with supported formats.\n\n### 🤖 AI-Powered Blog Post Generation  \n- The extracted text is analyzed by an AI model (GPT-based) to create a structured blog post.  \n- The AI generates:  \n  - A captivating SEO-friendly title.  \n  - Well-formatted HTML content, including an introduction, chapters with subheadings, and a conclusion.\n\n### 🎨 Image Creation & Integration  \n- An image is generated using **Pollinations.ai** based on the blog post title.  \n- The vibrant image is uploaded to WordPress and set as the featured image for the post.\n\n### 📝 WordPress Draft Creation  \n- A draft blog post is created on WordPress with the AI-generated title, content, and featured image.  \n\n### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop Approval  \n- The draft content is sent via Gmail to a reviewer for manual approval.  \n- If approved, the post is published on WordPress. If not, an error message is sent for troubleshooting.\n\n### 📢 Multi-Channel Notifications  \n- Once published, notifications are sent via Gmail and Telegram to relevant stakeholders.  \n\n## 🔧 Setup Steps\n\n### 🔑 Configure API Credentials  \n1. Set up API connections for:  \n   - OpenAI (for AI content generation).  \n   - WordPress (for post creation and media uploads).  \n   - Gmail (for sending approval emails).  \n   - Telegram (for notifications).\n   - imgbb (for saving blog image).\n\n### ⚙️ Customize Workflow Parameters  \n2. Adjust the AI prompt to match your desired blog structure and tone.  \n3. Modify the image generation parameters to align with your branding needs.\n\n### 🧪 Test & Deploy  \n3. Test the workflow with sample PDFs to ensure:  \n   - Accurate text extraction.  \n   - Proper formatting of generated content.  \n   - Seamless approval and publishing processes.  \n\n\nThis workflow streamlines content creation while maintaining quality control through human oversight, making it an ideal solution for efficient blog management! 🎉\n",
