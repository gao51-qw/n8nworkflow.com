It starts by reading a specific Google Sheet to find new video requests. A new request is identified as a row where the \"PROMPT\" and \"DURATION\" columns are filled, but the \"VIDEO\" column is empty.\n2.  **AI Video Generation:** For each new request, it takes the prompt and duration, then sends a request to the **Fal.ai Sora-2 Pro** model via its API to generate the video. The system then enters a polling loop, checking the video generation status every 60 seconds until it is `COMPLETED`.\n3.  **Post-Processing & Upload:** Once the video is ready, the workflow performs three parallel actions:\n    *   **Fetch Video & Upload to Drive:** It retrieves the generated video file and uploads it to a specified folder in Google Drive for archiving.\n    *   **Generate YouTube Title:** It sends the original prompt to **OpenAI's GPT-5** (or another specified model) to generate an optimized, SEO-friendly title for the YouTube video.\n    *   **Publish to YouTube:** It takes the generated video file and the AI-created title and uses the **Upload-Post.com** service to automatically publish the video to a connected YouTube channel.\n4.  **Update & Log:** Finally, the workflow updates the original Google Sheet row with the URL of the archived video in Google Drive and the newly created YouTube video URL, providing a complete audit trail.\n\n---\n### Set up Steps\n\nTo configure this workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**\n    *   Create a Google Sheet with at least these columns: `PROMPT`, `DURATION`, `VIDEO`, and `YOUTUBE_URL`.\n    *   In the n8n \"Get new video\" and update nodes, configure the `documentId` and `sheetName` to point to your specific Google Sheet.\n\n2.  **Configure Fal.ai API Key:**\n    *   Create an account on [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain your API key.\n    *   In both the \"Create Video\" and \"Get status\" HTTP Request nodes, set up the HTTP Header Authentication.\n    *   Set the `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.\n\n3.  **Set up Upload-Post.com for YouTube:**\n    *   Create an account on [Upload-Post.com](https://www.upload-post.com/) and get your API key. Connect your YouTube channel as a \"profile\".\n    *   In the \"HTTP Request\" node (for uploading), configure the Header Auth with `Name: Authorization` and `Value: Apikey YOUR_UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY`.\n    *   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the node's body parameters with the profile name you created on Upload-Post.com (e.g., `test1`).\n\n4.  **Configure OpenAI (Optional but Recommended):**\n    *   The \"Generate title\" node uses an OpenAI model. Ensure you have valid OpenAI API credentials set up in n8n for this node to function and create optimized titles.\n\n5.  **Finalize Paths and Activate:**\n    *   In the \"Upload Video\" node, specify the correct Google Drive folder ID where you want the videos to be saved.\n    *   Once all credentials and paths are set, you can activate the workflow and set the \"Schedule Trigger\" node to run at your desired interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).\n\n---\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
