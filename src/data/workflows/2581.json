  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates the easiest way to build a lead capture flow for your side project, startup or small business where simple works best!\n\nIf Typeform's costs are getting you down or you feel Google form URLs are off-putting, then definitely give this a try.\n\n## How it works\n* Our flow begins with a form trigger to capture a newsletter signup and the user's email is captured into a google sheet. Google Sheet is used for demonstration purposes but this could be any database.\n* Multi-page forms allow you to continue the onboarding experience with a short survey. 3 form nodes are chained to capture more details from the user which update the same row in the google sheet.\n* Finally, a form ending node shows a customised completion screen for our user.\n\nCheck out the example sheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W1PiFjCoiEBHHKKCRVMLmpKg4AWIy9w1dQ2Dq8qxPs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How to use\n* Keeping forms simple may serve to increase form completion rates. If you feel the need to add additional fields, consider breaking them up into more forms and group them contextually.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Sheets for data capture\n* Slack for notifications\n\nFeel free to swap these out for services that you use!\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* Play with multi-form design to maximise the opportunity of getting to know the user better. That said, lengthy flows are likely to put people off.\n* Instead of showing a static completion screen, perhaps redirecting to your blog or other more interesting page.",
