  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically syncs new Productboard features into Linear as issues and notifies the team via Telegram. It starts on a schedule, fetches Productboard features through API requests, and transforms the raw data into clean, structured fields. Newly created features are filtered, then inserted into Linear, and a success message is sent to Telegram for confirmation.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**1. Trigger and fetch data**  \n- **Schedule Trigger** – Starts the workflow at predefined intervals.  \n- **HTTP Request to Productboard** – Pulls the latest features from the Productboard API.  \n\n**2. Transform and clean data**  \n- **Code (Transform Features)** – Strips HTML, formats dates, and extracts clean fields like name, description, status, owner, and link.  \n\n**3. Filter for new items**  \n- **If (Filter New Features)** – Compares createdAt with today’s date, allowing only new features to proceed.  \n\n**4. Create issues in Linear**  \n- **Create Linear Issue** – Opens a new Linear issue using the feature’s name and description.  \n\n**5. Notify via Telegram**  \n- **Success Notification (Telegram)** – Sends a confirmation message once the sync is successful.  \n\n## Why use this?\n\n- Automates the sync of Productboard features into Linear without manual copying.  \n- Ensures only new features are captured, preventing duplicates.  \n- Keeps your team updated instantly through Telegram notifications.  \n- Saves time by standardizing data and formatting before inserting into Linear.  \n- Creates a smooth handoff from product planning to engineering execution.  \n",
