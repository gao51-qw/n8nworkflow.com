It buffers the data for a set period before a single execution retrieves and processes the entire batch.\n\n## Step-by-step Flow:\n1. Trigger: Data is received from a trigger (e.g., an external workflow execution).\n\n2. Lock Check: The system verifies that the queue is not currently locked; if it is, the process waits.\n\n3. Append: The received data is appended to a Redis list.\n\n4. Tagging: A unique execution identifier is generated and written to a specific Redis key (acting as a \"last writer\" marker).\n\n5. Wait: The execution pauses for a configured duration.\n\n6. Verification: After the wait, the execution checks if the Redis key still contains its specific identifier.\n\n7. Exit Condition: If the identifier has changed, it indicates a newer execution has arrived. The current execution terminates.\n\n8. Processing: If the identifier matches, this execution assumes responsibility for the batch. It locks the queue, retrieves all data, clears the Redis list, releases the lock, and forwards the aggregated data further.\n\n## Setup\n1. Add your Redis instance credentials\n2. Configure the debounce period (2 seconds by default)\n3. Adjust this workflow's trigger and what it calls in the end\n",
