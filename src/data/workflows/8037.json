  "description": "This workflow automatically turns any YouTube video into a structured blog post with Gemini AI. By sending a simple POST request with a YouTube URL to a webhook, it downloads the video’s audio, transcribes the content, and generates a blog-ready article with a title, description, tags, and category. The final result, along with the full transcript and original video URL, is delivered to your chosen webhook or CMS.\n\n## How it works:\nThe workflow handles the entire process of transforming YouTube videos into complete blog posts using Gemini AI transcription and structured text generation. Once triggered, it:\n- Downloads the video’s audio\n- Transcribes the spoken content into text\n- Generates a blog post in the same language as the video’s original language\n- Creates:\n\t- A clear and engaging title\n\t- A short description\n\t- Suggested category and tags\n\t- The full transcript of the video\n\t- The original YouTube video URL\n\nThis makes it easy to repurpose video content into publish-ready articles in minutes.\n\nThis template is ideal for content creators, marketers, educators, and bloggers who want to quickly turn video content into written posts without manual transcription or editing.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. Install **yt-dlp** on your local machine or server where n8n runs. This is required to download YouTube audio.\n2. Get a Google Gemini API key and configure it in your AI nodes.\n3. Webhook Input Configuration:\n\t- Endpoint: The workflow starts with a Webhook Trigger.\n\t- Method: POST\n\t- Example Request Body:\n```\n{\n\t\"videoUrl\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW5xEm7iSXk\"\n}\n```\n\n4. Configure Output Webhook: Add your target endpoint in the last node where the blog post JSON is sent. This could be your CMS, a Notion database, or another integration.\n\n## Customization Guidance\n- **Writing Style:** Update the AI Agent’s prompt to adjust tone (e.g., casual, professional, SEO-optimized).\n- **Metadata:** Modify how categories and tags are generated to fit your website’s taxonomy.\n- **Integration:** Swap the final webhook with WordPress, Ghost, Notion, or Slack to fit your publishing workflow.\n- **Transcript Handling:** Save the full transcript separately if you also want searchable video archives.\n",
