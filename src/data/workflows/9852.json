If a server responds with an error code or times out, the workflow automatically sends an email alert with the server details, including the endpoint, status, and timestamp. Multiple servers can be monitored in parallel, ensuring that issues are detected and reported in real time.\n\n## **How to set up**\n\n- Import the workflow template into n8n.\n- Replace the credentials with your credentials.\n- Configure the Email node with your SMTP credentials stored securely in n8n Credentials.\n- Set the Cron node interval to the frequency you want the checks to run (e.g., every 5 minutes).\n\n## **Requirements**\n\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- SMTP email credentials (Gmail, Outlook, or any SMTP server)\n- Servers with endpoints accessible by n8n",
