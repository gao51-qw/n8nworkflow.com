It aggregates data from your daily tools (Google Calendar, Todoist, and Slack) to provide AI-driven insights into your work habits. It runs daily to log metrics to Google Sheets and sends a summary to Slack. Additionally, every Friday, it generates a comprehensive strategic weekly review.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Remote Workers & Freelancers** who want to track their focus time and meeting load.\n- **Productivity Enthusiasts** looking to automate their \"Quantified Self\" data collection.\n- **Managers** who want a high-level overview of their weekly throughput and communication volume without manual tracking.\n\n## What it does\n1. **Daily Trigger:** Runs automatically every weekday morning (default: 8 AM).\n2. **Data Collection:**\n   - Fetches today's meetings from **Google Calendar**.\n   - Retrieves high-priority and overdue tasks from **Todoist**.\n   - Analyzes recent message activity from **Slack**.\n3. **AI Analysis:** Uses **OpenAI** to analyze the data, identifying focus blocks and potential overload risks.\n4. **Logging:** Saves raw metrics (meeting hours, task counts, message volume) to a **Google Sheet** for historical tracking.\n5. **Reporting:**\n   - Sends a \"Daily Productivity Summary\" to Slack with actionable advice.\n   - On Fridays, it pulls the last 7 days of data from Google Sheets to generate and send a **Weekly Strategic Report** to Slack.\n\n## Requirements\n- **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n- **Google Cloud Console** project with Calendar and Sheets APIs enabled.\n- **Todoist** account.\n- **Slack** workspace.\n- **OpenAI** API Key (GPT-4 is recommended for better analysis).\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configure Credentials:** Set up your credentials in n8n for Google (OAuth2), Todoist, Slack, and OpenAI.\n2. **Prepare Google Sheet:**\n   - Create a new Google Sheet.\n   - Create the following header columns in the first row: `date`, `meetingHours`, `tasksCount`, `slackMessages`.\n3. **Update Nodes:**\n   - **Log Daily Metrics** node: Select your Spreadsheet and Sheet name.\n   - **Fetch Last 7 Days Data** node: Select the same Spreadsheet.\n   - **Slack** nodes: Select the channel where you want to receive reports.\n4. **Activate:** Toggle the workflow to **Active**.\n\n## How to customize\n- **Adjust Schedule:** Change the *Schedule Daily Execution* node to fit your preferred reporting time.\n- **Modify AI Persona:** Edit the system prompt in the *AI Analysis* node to change the tone of the report (e.g., make it more strict or more encouraging).\n- **Add Data Sources:** You can easily chain additional nodes (like GitHub or Jira) into the *Aggregate Data* code node to include coding or project management metrics.\n\n",
