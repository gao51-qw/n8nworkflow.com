  "description": "Generate & Schedule Social Media Posts with GPT-4 and Telegram Approval Workflow\n\nThis comprehensive content automation system features 23 nodes that seamlessly orchestrate AI-powered content creation, validation, and multi-platform publishing through Telegram interaction. It supports posting to major platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and more via the Upload-Post API.\n\nCore Components\nTelegram Integration: Bidirectional messaging with approval workflows and real-time notifications.\n\nAI Content Engine: Configurable language models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) via OpenRouter with structured output parsing.\n\nContent Validation: Character count enforcement (240-265), format checking, and quality threshold monitoring.\n\nMulti-Platform Publishing: Post on any social media platform with Upload-Post API - better and easier to use than Blotato, with a dedicated n8n community node.\n\nApproval System: Preview and approve/reject functionality before content goes live.\n\nWeb Research: Optional Tavily integration for real-time information gathering.\n\nTarget Users\nContent creators seeking consistent social media presence.\n\nDigital marketers managing multiple brand accounts.\n\nEntrepreneurs wanting automated thought leadership.\n\nAgencies needing scalable content solutions.\n\nSmall businesses without dedicated social media teams.\n\nSetup Requirements\nTo get started, you'll need:\n\nTelegram Bot: Create via @BotFather and configure webhook.\n\nRequired APIs:\n\nOpenRouter (for AI model access).\n\nUpload-Post API (superior alternative to Blotato with community node support).\n\nTavily API (optional for research).\n\nn8n Prerequisites:\n\nVersion 1.7+ with Langchain nodes.\n\nWebhook configuration enabled.\n\nProper credential storage setup.\n\nDisclaimer: This template uses community-supported nodes, such as the Upload-Post API node. These may require additional setup and could change with n8n updates. Always verify compatibility and test in a safe environment.\n\nStep-by-Step Setup Guide\nInstall n8n: Ensure you're running n8n version 1.7 or higher. Enable webhook configurations in your settings.\n\nSet Up Credentials: In n8n, add credentials for OpenRouter, Upload-Post API, and optionally Tavily. Store them securely.\n\nCreate Telegram Bot: Go to Telegram, search for @BotFather, and create a new bot. Note the token and set up a webhook pointing to your n8n instance.\n\nImport the Workflow: Copy the workflow JSON (available in the template submission) and import it into your n8n dashboard.\n\nConfigure Nodes:\n\nSet your AI model preferences in the OpenRouter node.\n\nLink your social media accounts via the Upload-Post API node.\n\nAdjust validation settings (e.g., character limits, retry attempts) as needed.\n\nTest the Workflow: Trigger a test run via Telegram by sending a content request. Approve or reject the preview, and monitor the output.\n\nSchedule or Automate: Use n8n's scheduling features for automated triggers, or run manually for on-demand posts.\n\nUsage Instructions\nInitiate via Telegram: Send a message to your bot with a topic or prompt (e.g., \"Create a post about AI automation for entrepreneurs\").\n\nAI Generation: The system generates content using your chosen model, with optional web research.\n\nValidation Check: Content is automatically validated for length, quality (70% pass threshold), and format.\n\nApproval Workflow: Receive a preview in Telegram. Reply with \"approve\" to post, or \"reject\" to retry (up to 3 attempts).\n\nPublishing: Approved content posts to your selected platforms. Get notifications on success or errors.\n\nCustomization: Adapt for single posts, 3-6 post threads, or different tones (business, creative, educational, personal, technical). Use scheduling for consistent posting.\n\nWorkflow Features\nUniversal Platform Support: Post to any social media platform via Upload-Post API.\n\nScheduling Flexibility: Automated triggers or manual execution.\n\nContent Types: Single posts or multi-post threads.\n\nQuality Control: 30% error tolerance with detailed validation reporting.\n\nCharacter Optimization: Enforced 240-265 character range for maximum engagement.\n\nTopic Versatility: Adapts tone and style based on content type.\n\nError Handling: Comprehensive validation with helpful user feedback.\n\nPerformance Specifications:\n\nAI retry attempts: 3 for reliability.\n\nValidation threshold: 70% pass rate.\n\nFormat support: Single posts and 3-6 post threads.\n\nPlatform coverage: Any social media platform through Upload-Post API.\n\nResearch capability: Optional web search for trending topics.\n\nWhy Upload-Post API?\nCommunity-supported n8n node for easier integration.\n\nMore reliable and feature-rich than Blotato.\n\nSupports all major social platforms.\n\nActive development and support.\n\nWorkflow Image\n![n8n_AutomatedContent.png](fileId:1752)\n\nNeed help customizing this workflow for your specific use case, Femi? As a fellow entrepreneur passionate about automation and business development, I'd be happy to consult.
