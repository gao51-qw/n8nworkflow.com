  "description": "### Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is perfect for operations teams, accountants, e-commerce businesses, or finance managers who regularly process digital invoices and need to automate data extraction and record-keeping.\n\n---\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nManually reading invoice PDFs, extracting relevant data, and entering it into spreadsheets is time-consuming and error-prone. This workflow automates that process—watching a Google Drive folder, extracting structured invoice data using Dumpling AI, and saving the results into Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n1. Watches a specific Google Drive folder for new invoices.\n2. Downloads the uploaded invoice file.\n3. Converts the file into a Base64 format.\n4. Sends the file to Dumpling AI’s `extract-document` endpoint with a detailed parsing prompt.\n5. Parses Dumpling AI’s JSON response using a Code node.\n6. Splits the `items` array into individual rows using the Split Out node.\n7. Appends each invoice item to a preformatted Google Sheet along with the full header metadata (order number, PO, addresses, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Setup\n\n1. **Google Drive Setup**\n   - Create or select a folder in Google Drive and place the folder ID in the trigger node.\n   - Make sure your n8n Google Drive credentials are authorized for access.\n\n2. **Google Sheets**\n   - Create a Google Sheet with the following headers:\n     `Order number`, `Document Date`, `Po_number`, `Sold to name`, `Sold to address`, `Ship to name`, `Ship to address`, `Model`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `Unity price`, `Total price`\n   - Paste the Sheet ID and sheet name (`Sheet1`) into the Google Sheets node.\n\n3. **Dumpling AI**\n   - Sign up at [Dumpling AI](https://www.dumplingai.com/)\n   - Go to your account settings and generate your API key.\n   - Paste this key into the HTTP header of the Dumpling AI request node.\n   - The endpoint used is: `https://app.dumplingai.com/api/v1/extract-document`\n\n4. **Prompt (already included)**\n   - This prompt extracts: order number, document date, PO number, shipping/billing details, and detailed line items (model, quantity, unit price, total).\n\n---\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Adjust the Google Sheet fields to fit your invoice structure.\n- Modify the Dumpling AI prompt if your invoices have additional or different data points.\n- Add filtering logic if you want to handle different invoice types differently.\n- Replace Google Sheets with Airtable or a database if preferred.\n- Use a different trigger like an email attachment if invoices come via email.\n\n---\n",
