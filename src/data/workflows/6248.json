  "description": "## Automate Market Problem Discovery from Reddit with OpenAI\n\n### Who’s it for  \nThis workflow is perfect for **entrepreneurs, startup founders, product managers, researchers, and market analysts** who want to **automatically discover and analyze real market problems** from online discussions.  \nWhile this example focuses on identifying issues in the **future of work** and **future of education**, it can be fully adapted to detect **any type of market pain point** by changing the data sources and AI prompts.\n\nIf you’re looking to **automate market research**, **find customer pain points**, or **detect unmet needs** in your industry, this template is for you.\n\n### What it does  \nThis no-code n8n automation:\n1. **Collects fresh discussions from Reddit** (default: `Teachers`, `Education`, `RemoteWork` subreddits).\n2. **Filters posts by engagement** (more than 5 upvotes by default).\n3. **Uses OpenAI GPT-4.1** to:\n   - Detect if a post describes a real market problem.\n   - Identify the **underlying pain or unmet need**.\n   - Suggest a **practical, tech/AI-based solution**.\n   - Score the problem’s **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Ease of prototyping** (ICE framework).\n4. **Saves results to Google Sheets** for easy prioritization and action.\n\nThis allows you to **automate the detection of market opportunities** without manually reading through hundreds of posts.\n\n### How it works  \n- **Schedule Trigger**: Runs the workflow at your preferred interval (daily, hourly, etc.).  \n- **Reddit Nodes**: Pull posts from the targeted subreddits (you can replace them with any niche communities).  \n- **Filter Node**: Keeps only posts with engagement above your threshold.  \n- **OpenAI Node**: Analyzes each post using a **User Prompt** and **System Prompt** in English, returning structured JSON data.  \n- **Google Sheets Node**: Stores all results with full scoring for later review and prioritization.\n\n### Requirements  \n- Reddit OAuth2 API credentials.  \n- OpenAI API key.  \n- Google Sheets OAuth2 API credentials.  \n- A Google Sheet with these columns:  \n  `SubReddit, Title, Content, Short Description, Detected Pain, Possible Solution, Impact, Confidence, Ease, URL, ICE Score`\n\n### How to customize  \n- **Change the market focus**: Replace example subreddits with your own industry forums or communities.  \n- **Adjust the filter criteria**: Modify the upvote threshold or other parameters.  \n- **Edit the AI prompts**: Tailor them to detect specific types of problems (healthtech, fintech, sustainability, etc.).  \n- **Integrate more sources**: Add Twitter, LinkedIn, or customer support logs for richer insights.\n\n---\n\n💡 With this automation, you can **continuously monitor and capture market pain points**, turning raw online discussions into **actionable business opportunities**.\n",
