  "description": "Streamline your post-event analysis with this smart n8n workflow. Triggered by a simple webhook, it instantly gathers attendee and engagement data from your event platform, calculates key metrics, and uses AI to generate a polished, professional report. The final summary is emailed to stakeholders and saved securely in a database — all without manual effort. Perfect for conferences, webinars, and corporate events. 📧📈\n\n\n### Key Features  \n- **Webhook triggered** – Starts instantly via HTTP POST request  \n- **Multi-source data collection** – Fetches attendees & engagement metrics  \n- **Advanced analytics** – Calculates attendance rates, engagement scores, top sessions  \n- **AI-powered insights** – Uses GPT-4 to generate professional reports  \n- **Auto-email delivery** – Sends report to stakeholders  \n- **Database archiving** – Saves reports to PostgreSQL  \n\n\n### What it Analyzes  \n- Attendance rates & check-ins  \n- Average session time  \n- Engagement scores (polls, Q&A, networking)  \n- Top performing sessions  \n- Attendee breakdown (by role & company)  \n- AI-generated insights & recommendations  \n\n\n### Workflow Process  \n- The **Webhook Trigger** node starts the workflow when an HTTP POST request is received with event details.  \n- **Get Attendees (GET)** pulls the list of registered and checked-in participants from your event system.  \n- **Get Engagement Metrics (GET)** retrieves interaction data like poll responses, Q&A activity, and session views.  \n- **Process Metrics** calculates key stats: attendance rate, average session duration, engagement score, and ranks top sessions.  \n- **AI Generate Report** uses GPT-4 to create a clear, professional summary with insights and recommendations based on the data.  \n- **AI Agent** coordinates data flow and prepares the final report structure using chat model and memory tools.  \n- **Save to Database (Insert)** stores the full report and raw metrics in PostgreSQL for future reference.  \n- **Send Report Email** automatically emails the AI-generated report to the specified recipient.  \n- **Send Response** returns a confirmation back to the triggering system via webhook.  \n\n\n### Setup Instructions  \n- Import this JSON into n8n  \n- Configure credentials:  \n  - Event API (for GET requests)  \n  - OpenAI (GPT-4)  \n  - SMTP (for email delivery)  \n  - PostgreSQL (for data storage)  \n- Trigger via webhook with event data  \n- Receive comprehensive report via email within minutes!  \n\n\n### Prerequisites  \n- Event platform with REST API (for attendee & engagement data)  \n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 access)  \n- SMTP server credentials (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)  \n- PostgreSQL database with write access  \n\n\n### Example Webhook Payload  \n```json\n{\n  \"eventId\": \"evt_123\",\n  \"eventName\": \"Tech Summit 2025\",\n  \"eventDate\": \"2025-10-29\",\n  \"email\": \"manager@company.com\"\n}\n```\n\n\n### Modification Options  \n- Add custom metrics in the **Process Metrics** node (e.g., NPS score, feedback sentiment)  \n- Change AI tone in **AI Generate Report** (formal, executive summary, or creative)  \n- Modify email template in **Send Report Email** with your branding  \n- Connect to different data sources by updating GET nodes  \n- Add Slack or Teams notification after **Send Report Email**  \n\n\n**Ready to automate your event reporting?**  \n[Get in touch with us](https://www.oneclickitsolution.com/contact-us/) for custom n8n workflows!",
