It solves the constant problem of copy-pasting and context-switching between a separate AI chat and Notion by creating a direct, conversational bridge. Now you can interact with an intelligent agent that can create, retrieve, and update your Notion databases and pages on your behalf, turning your workspace into a truly dynamic productivity hub.\n\n![Screenshot 20250610 at 13.52.46.png](fileId:1474)\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you send a message via the chat interface, the workflow passes it to your chosen AI model. The model, connected to the official Notion tool server, analyzes your request to see if it can be fulfilled by one of its available Notion actions. If it matches a tool, the workflow executes the command using the Notion API—like creating a new page or searching a database—and the AI then confirms the action is complete back in the chat.\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisite:** This template is for **self-hosted n8n instances only**, as it requires a community node. \n\n1. Copy this workflow into your self-hosted n8n instance \n2. Install the required community node (n8n-nodes-mcp).\n3. Add your credentials for your chosen AI Model and the Notion MCP Server.\n4. Test the workflow by starting chatting with your new Notion assistant.\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n\n- You can use the AI model you want and even easily compare different AI models.\n- You can start from this template and then provide other tools to your AI agent to build more powerful workflows.",
