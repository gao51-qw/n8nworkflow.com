Configure ScrapeGraphAI Credentials\n- Navigate to Credentials in your n8n instance\n- Add new ScrapeGraphAI API credentials\n- Enter your API key from ScrapeGraphAI dashboard\n- Test the connection to ensure it's working\n\n#### 3. Set up Schedule Trigger\n- Configure the monitoring frequency (default: every 30 minutes)\n- Adjust timing based on your operational needs:\n  - Every 15 minutes: `*/15 * * * *`\n  - Every hour: `0 * * * *`\n  - Every 5 minutes: `*/5 * * * *`\n\n#### 4. Configure Dashboard URL\n- Update the \"Get Data\" node with your IoT dashboard URL\n- Customize the AI prompt to match your dashboard structure\n- Test data extraction to ensure proper JSON formatting\n- Adjust device field mappings as needed\n\n#### 5. Set up Telegram Notifications\n- Create a Telegram bot using @BotFather\n- Get your chat ID from @userinfobot\n- Configure Telegram credentials in n8n\n- Test message delivery to ensure alerts work\n\n#### 6. Customize Health Thresholds\n- Adjust health score threshold (default: 80%)\n- Set battery alert level (default: 20%)\n- Configure temperature warning (default: 70°C)\n- Customize alert conditions based on your requirements\n\n#### 7. Test and Validate\n- Run the workflow manually with your dashboard\n- Verify device data extraction accuracy\n- Test alert conditions and message formatting\n- Confirm logging functionality works correctly\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Customization Options\n\n### Modify Monitoring Frequency\n- Adjust schedule for different device criticality levels\n- Add business hours vs. off-hours monitoring\n- Implement variable frequency based on system health\n- Add manual trigger for on-demand monitoring\n\n### Extend Device Analysis\n- Add more device metrics (memory, CPU, network bandwidth)\n- Implement predictive maintenance algorithms\n- Include environmental sensors (humidity, air quality)\n- Add device lifecycle and warranty tracking\n\n### Customize Alert Logic\n- Implement escalation rules for critical alerts\n- Add alert suppression during maintenance windows\n- Create different alert channels for different severity levels\n- Include automated ticket creation for persistent issues\n\n### Output Customization\n- Add integration with monitoring platforms (Grafana, Datadog)\n- Implement email notifications for management reports\n- Create executive dashboards with health trends\n- Add integration with maintenance management systems\n\n## 📈 Use Cases\n\n- **Industrial IoT Monitoring**: Track manufacturing equipment and sensors\n- **Smart Building Management**: Monitor HVAC, lighting, and security systems\n- **Fleet Management**: Track vehicle telematics and diagnostic systems\n- **Healthcare Device Monitoring**: Ensure medical device uptime and performance\n- **Smart City Infrastructure**: Monitor traffic lights, environmental sensors, and public systems\n- **Energy Grid Monitoring**: Track smart meters and distribution equipment\n\n## 🚨 Important Notes\n\n- Respect your dashboard's terms of service and rate limits\n- Implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid overloading systems\n- Regularly review and update device thresholds based on operational experience\n- Monitor ScrapeGraphAI API usage to manage costs effectively\n- Keep your credentials secure and rotate them regularly\n- Ensure alert recipients are available to respond to critical notifications\n- Consider implementing backup monitoring systems for critical infrastructure\n- Maintain device inventories and update monitoring parameters as systems evolve\n\n## 🔧 Troubleshooting\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI connection errors: Verify API key and account status\n- Dashboard access issues: Check URL accessibility and authentication requirements\n- Data extraction failures: Review AI prompt and dashboard structure changes\n- Missing device data: Verify device naming conventions and field mappings\n- Alert delivery failures: Check Telegram bot configuration and chat permissions\n- False alerts: Adjust health thresholds and alert logic conditions\n\n**Support Resources:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI documentation and API reference\n- n8n community forums for workflow assistance\n- Telegram Bot API documentation\n- IoT platform-specific monitoring best practices\n- Device manufacturer monitoring guidelines\n- Industrial IoT monitoring standards and frameworks\n",
