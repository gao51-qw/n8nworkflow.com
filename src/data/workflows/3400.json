  "description": "## Send structured logs to BetterStack from any workflow using HTTP Request\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is perfect for **automation builders, developers, and DevOps teams** using n8n who want to send structured log messages to [BetterStack Logs](https://betterstack.com/logs). Whether you're monitoring mission-critical workflows or simply want centralized visibility into process execution, this reusable log template makes integration easy.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nLogging failures or events across multiple workflows typically requires duplicated logic. This workflow solves that by acting as a **shared log sender**, letting you forward consistent log entries from any other workflow using the **Execute Workflow** node.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n- Accepts `level` (e.g., \"info\", \"warn\", \"error\") and `message` fields via `Execute Workflow Trigger`\n- Sends the structured log to your BetterStack ingestion endpoint via **HTTP Request**\n- Uses **HTTP Header Auth** for secure delivery\n- Includes a **manual trigger** for testing and a sample call to demonstrate usage\n- Comes with clear sticky notes to help you get started\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Copy your BetterStack Logs ingestion URL.\n2. Create a **Header Auth credential** in n8n with your `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.\n3. Replace the URL in the HTTP Request node with your BetterStack endpoint.\n4. Optionally modify the test data or log levels for custom scenarios.\n5. Use `Execute Workflow` in any of your workflows to send logs here.",
