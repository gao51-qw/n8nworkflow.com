To start the workflow add a task to Todoist and mark it with a label, e.g. “send-to-n8n”.\n2. Wait a maximum of 30 seconds.\n3. Todoist node identifies the tasks marked as “send-to-n8n”.\n4. Notion node creates a new Notion database page. Notice Notion has a new task now with the same name as in Todoist.",
