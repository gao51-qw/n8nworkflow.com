Copy this [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RBZ_VcxxkNqU6weYv5OxX7OWj1Y46WLHM1sbLw-iCVc/copy) (make your own copy)\n2. Create a JotForm with fields: First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Phone, Message\n3. Get your Reoon API key from their dashboard\n4. Get your Apollo.io API key from account settings\n5. Connect your Google Sheets account in n8n\n\n## How to customize\n\n- **Change verification level**: Modify the \"mode\" parameter in the Reoon API call (options: quick, power)\n- **Adjust filtering criteria**: Update the IF node to filter by different email quality metrics\n- **Add more enrichment**: Apollo returns additional data fields you can map to your sheet\n- **Notification layer**: Add a Send Email or Slack node after enrichment to notify your team of high-quality leads\n- **CRM integration**: Replace or supplement Google Sheets with HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive nodes\n\n---\n\nThis workflow provides a complete lead qualification pipeline that saves time and ensures only high-quality, validated contacts make it into your database with enriched professional information.",
