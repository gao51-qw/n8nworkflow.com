  "description": "Managing invoices manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This workflow automates the process by extracting key invoice details from PDFs shared in Slack, structuring the information with AI, saving it to Google Sheets, and sending a confirmation back to Slack. It’s a seamless way to keep your financial records organized without manual data entry.\n\n## How it works\n1. Receive invoice in Slack – When a PDF invoice is uploaded to a designated Slack channel, the workflow is triggered.\n2. Fetch the PDF – The file is downloaded automatically for processing.\n3. Extract data from PDF – Basic text extraction is performed to capture invoice content.\n4. AI-powered invoice parsing – An AI model interprets the extracted text and structures essential fields such as company name, invoice number, total amount, invoice date, and due date.\n5. Save to Google Sheets – The structured invoice data is appended as a new row in a Google Sheet for easy tracking and reporting.\n6. Slack confirmation – A summary of the saved invoice details is sent back to Slack to notify the team.\n\n## How to use\n1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.\n2. Connect Slack – Authenticate your Slack account and set up the trigger channel where invoices will be uploaded.\n3. Connect Google Sheets – Authenticate with Google Sheets and specify the target spreadsheet and sheet name.\n4. Configure the AI extraction – Adjust the parsing prompt or output structure to fit your preferred data fields (e.g., vendor name, invoice ID, amount, dates).\n5. Test the workflow – Upload a sample invoice PDF in Slack and verify that the data is correctly extracted and saved to Google Sheets.\n\n## Requirements\n- An n8n instance (cloud)\n- Slack account with permission to read uploaded files and post messages\n- Google account with access to the spreadsheet you want to update\n- AI integration (e.g., OpenAI GPT or another LLM with PDF parsing capabilities)\n- A designated Slack channel for receiving invoice PDFs",
