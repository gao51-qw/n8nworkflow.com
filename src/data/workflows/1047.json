This information gets passed on to the next node in the workflow.\n\n**Set node:** We will use the Set node to ensure that only the data that we set in this node gets passed on to the next nodes in the workflow.\n\n**AWS SQS:** This node will send the data from the previous node to the `iss-position` queue. If you have created a queue with a different one, you can use that queue instead.",
