Ensure your bot is added to the intended chat.\n\nConnect your OpenAI credentials by inserting your API key in the OpenAI node and configuring it for image generation.\n\nConnect your Google Sheets account by authorising the Google Sheets node and selecting the target spreadsheet and worksheet where you want to save prompts and image links.\n\nFinally, activate the workflow and test by sending a prompt to your Telegram bot to confirm that the image is generated, saved to Google Sheets, and sent back to Telegram seamlessly.\n\nThat’s it – your AI Image Generator with Google Sheets logging is ready to use.\n\t\t\n⸻\n\n✅ That’s it – your AI Image Generator with Google Sheets logging is ready for use.",
