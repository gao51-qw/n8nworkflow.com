  "description": "This workflow creates a user-friendly web form to upload a file, which allows users to upload a **single large file** (*up to 5Gb*) through a custom web form and automatically send it via **TransferNow**, handling the complex multi-part upload process required for **large files**.\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n* ✅ **No manual steps**: The entire process from file upload to email delivery is fully automated.\n* ✅**User-friendly**: Anyone can upload files via a simple web form, without needing to access TransferNow directly.\n* ✅**Supports large files**: TransferNow’s API handles large files that are not suitable for email attachments.\n* ✅ **Secure file delivery**: The workflow uses TransferNow’s secure, expiring download links.\n* ✅**Customizable**: You can easily adjust the workflow to support multiple file types, multiple recipients, or different validity rules.\n* ✅**Scalable**: Works for individuals, teams, or businesses that frequently need to share large documents.\n\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\nThe workflow is triggered when a user submits the embedded web form. Here is the process:\n\n1.  **Form Trigger:** A user accesses the form, fills in the required details (Title, Message, Recipient Email), and uploads a single PDF file. Submitting the form starts the workflow.\n2.  **File Processing:** The workflow calculates the size of the uploaded file, which is a necessary parameter for the TransferNow API.\n3.  **Transfer Creation:** It sends a request to the TransferNow API to create a new file transfer. The API responds with details needed for the upload, including a unique `transferId` and `uploadId`.\n4.  **Upload URL Retrieval:** The workflow requests a pre-signed upload URL from TransferNow for the specific part of the file.\n5.  **File Upload:** The binary file data from the form and the upload URL from the previous step are merged. The workflow then performs a direct `PUT` request to the secured TransferNow URL to upload the file's binary content.\n6.  **Upload Confirmation:** After the upload, the workflow informs the TransferNow API that the file part upload is complete.\n7.  **Finalization:** Once the entire upload is confirmed, the workflow finalizes the transfer on TransferNow's side.\n8.  **Data Retrieval & Response:** The workflow fetches the final transfer data, constructs a public download URL, and sends a success message back to the user's browser, displaying the recipient's email and the download link.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo use this workflow, you need to configure the connection to the TransferNow API.\n\n1.  **Get TransferNow API Credentials:**\n    *   Create a free account on TransferNow developer portal to get your API key (a 14-day free trial is available).\n\n2.  **Configure Credentials in n8n:**\n    *   In the n8n editor, locate the HTTP Request nodes named \"Set Transfer\", \"Get Upload Url\", etc.\n    *   These nodes use a credential called \"Header Auth TransferNow\". You need to create this credential.\n    *   Go to **Credentials &gt; Add Credential** and select \"HTTP Header Auth\".\n    *   Give it a name (e.g., \"TransferNow API Key\").\n    *   In the **Name** field, enter `x-api-key`.\n    *   In the **Value** field, paste your personal TransferNow API key.\n    *   Save the credential. The existing nodes will automatically use it, or you can select it from the dropdown in each node's credentials section.\n\n3.  **Activate the Workflow:**\n    *   Save the workflow and click the **Activate** toggle to make it live.\n    *   Once activated, the **On form submission** node will provide a unique public URL for your form. Share this URL with users to start uploading and sending files.\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).\n",
