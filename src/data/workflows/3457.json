Additionally, other email categories can be added, each with it's own workflow.\n\n## How it works\n- Every time a new email is received, an OpenAI model classifies it into a predefined category by analyzing the plain text of the email and the extracted content from the attachment.\n- If the email is classified as a job application, an OpenAI model uses the email’s plain text and extracted attachment content to populate predefined fields such as age and study.\n- A relevant additional step would be to directly push the applicant and their structured job application into a CRM or ATS like Hubspot or Recruitee.\n\n## Set up steps\n1. Configure your IMAP credentials to connect your email account.
