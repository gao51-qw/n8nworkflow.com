  "description": "###  This n8n template lets you run prompts against 350+ LLM models and see exactly what each request costs with real-time pricing from OpenRouter\n\n  Use cases are many: Compare costs across different models, plan your AI budget, optimize prompts for cost efficiency, or track expenses for client billing!\n\n  ## Good to know\n\n  - OpenRouter charges a platform fee on top of model costs. See [OpenRouter Pricing](https://openrouter.ai/pricing) for details.\n  - You need an OpenRouter account with API credits. Free signup available with some free models included.\n  - Pricing data is fetched live from OpenRouter's API, so costs are always up-to-date.\n\n  ## How it works\n\n  1. All available models are fetched from OpenRouter's API when you start.\n  2. You select a model and enter your prompt via the form (or just use the chat).\n  3. The prompt is sent to OpenRouter and the response is captured.\n  4. Token usage (input/output) is extracted from the response using a LangChain Code node.\n  5. Real-time pricing for your selected model is fetched from OpenRouter.\n  6. The exact cost is calculated and displayed alongside your AI response.\n\n  ## How to use\n\n  - **Chat interface**: Quick testing - just type a prompt and get the response with costs.\n  - **Form interface**: Select from all available models via dropdown, enter your prompt, and get a detailed cost breakdown.\n  - Click **\"Show Details\"** on the result form to see the full breakdown (input tokens, output tokens, cost per type).\n\n  ## Requirements\n\n  - OpenRouter account with API key ([Get one here](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys))\n\n  ## Customising this workflow\n\n  - Add a database node to log all requests and costs over time\n  - Connect to Google Sheets for cost tracking and reporting\n  - Extend with LLM-as-Judge evaluation to also check response quality",
