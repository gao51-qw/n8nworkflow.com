  "description": "![image.png](fileId:3043)\nThis workflow automates the creation of user-generated-content-style product videos by combining Gemini's image generation with OpenAI's SORA 2 video generation. It accepts webhook requests with product descriptions, generates images and videos, stores them in Google Drive, and logs all outputs to Google Sheets for easy tracking.\n\n### Main Use Cases\n* Automate product video creation for e-commerce catalogs and social media.\n* Generate UGC-style content at scale without manual design work.\n* Create engaging video content from simple text prompts for marketing campaigns.\n* Build a centralized library of product videos with automated tracking and storage.\n\n### How it works\nThe workflow operates as a webhook-triggered process, organized into these stages:\n\n1. **Webhook Trigger & Input**\n   * Accepts POST requests to the `/create-ugc-video` endpoint.\n   * Required payload includes: product prompt, video prompt, Gemini API key, and OpenAI API key.\n\n2. **Image Generation (Gemini)**\n   * Sends the product prompt to Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model.\n   * Generates a product image based on the description provided.\n\n3. **Data Extraction**\n   * Code node extracts the base64 image data from Gemini's response.\n   * Preserves all prompts and API keys for subsequent steps.\n\n4. **Video Generation (SORA 2)**\n   * Sends the video prompt to OpenAI's SORA 2 API.\n   * Initiates video generation with specifications: 720x1280 resolution, 8 seconds duration.\n   * Returns a video generation job ID for polling.\n\n5. **Video Status Polling**\n   * Continuously checks video generation status via OpenAI API.\n   * If status is \"completed\": proceeds to download.\n   * If status is still processing: waits 1 minute and retries (polling loop).\n\n6. **Video Download & Storage**\n   * Downloads the completed video file from OpenAI.\n   * Uploads the MP4 file to Google Drive (root folder).\n   * Generates a shareable Google Drive link.\n\n7. **Logging to Google Sheets**\n   * Records all generation details in a tracking spreadsheet:\n     * Product description\n     * Video URL (Google Drive link)\n     * Generation status\n     * Timestamp\n\n### Summary Flow:\nWebhook Request → Generate Product Image (Gemini) → Extract Image Data → Generate Video (SORA 2) → Poll Status → If Complete: Download Video → Upload to Google Drive → Log to Google Sheets → Return Response\n\nIf Not Complete: Wait 1 Minute → Poll Status Again\n\n### Benefits:\n* Fully automated video creation pipeline from text to finished product.\n* Scalable solution for generating multiple product videos on demand.\n* Combines cutting-edge AI models (Gemini + SORA 2) for high-quality output.\n* Centralized storage in Google Drive with automatic logging in Google Sheets.\n* Flexible webhook interface allows integration with any application or service.\n* Retry mechanism ensures videos are captured even with longer processing times.\n\n---\nCreated by [Daniel Shashko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shashko/)",
