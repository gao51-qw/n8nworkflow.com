  "description": "## How it Works.\n\nThe workflow runs automatically every day and collects analytics data for both today and yesterday. It cleans and standardizes both datasets in the same way so they are easy to compare. After that, it measures how performance has changed from one day to the next and interprets those changes to understand trends and context. Once all calculations are finished, the AI creates a clear, easy-to-read summary of what happened. This summary is then formatted and sent through the required communication channels, while the final data is saved for tracking over time and for creating follow-up tasks if needed.\n\n## Key Features:\n- Trigger runs once per day recommended (11: 57 PM).\n- Fetch seperate data for today and yesterday in node.\n- Compare the two days data and highlight if traffic is less\n- Add the trend `lowTraffic` for low traffic identification.\n- Using GPT-4 Mini for human readable summary to suit different communication channels.\n- Sending report to WhatsApp / Email\n- Stored the final structure data to Google Sheet for future analytics and historical record\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n#### 1. Connect Required Credentials\nYou must connect the following credentials:\nGoogle Analytics API\nGoogle Sheets\nOpenAi API\nEmail SMTP\nWhatsApp API\nClickUp API\n\n#### 2. Replace Defalut Values\nUpdate the workflow with:\nYour Google Analytics Id's\nYour Google Sheet Tabs\nReplace SMTP Credentials, sender and recipients\nChange with your OpenAi API key\nCreate your WhatApi API Credentials\nClickUp API Key's\n\n#### 3. Customize Email Template\nModify subject, message body, or formatting style based on your reporting standards.\n\n#### 4. Adjust Trigger\nYou may choose:\nManual Trigger\nCron Trigger for daily/weekly report\nWebhook Trigger integrated with your system\n\n\n## Detailed Process Flow\n\n#### Schedule Trigger\n\n- Node Type: Trigger Node\n- Purpose: Automates the start of the workflow.\n- Details:\nRuns every day (or every hour if real-time monitoring is needed).\nEliminates manual data collection and ensures consistent reporting.\n\n#### Analytics Reports\n\n- Node Type :- Google Analytics Node\n- Purpose: Fetch website performance data\n- Metrics includes: users, sessions, page views\n\n#### Combine the Data\n\n\n- Node Type: Merge Node (Append)\n- Purpose: Combines today’s and yesterday’s datasets into a single item for comparison.\n- Details:\nPrepares data for calculating percentage changes.\nMaintains proper structure for further nodes.\n\n#### Calculate Percent Changes\n\n- Node Type: Function Node\n- Purpose: Computes day-over-day percentage changes for users, sessions, and page views.\n- Details:\nFormula: ((today - yesterday) / yesterday) * 100\nHandles increases and decreases correctly.\nOutputs values used for trend indicators and alerts.\n\n#### Generate AI Summary\n\n- Node Type: OpenAI Node\n- Purpose: Produces human-readable, professional insights about the daily analytics.\n- Details:\nSummarizes key changes, trends, and recommendations.\nProvides context such as low-traffic warnings.\nText output is used in emails, WhatsApp, and ClickUp tasks.\n\n#### Send Email or Whatsapp to Dedicated Person / Marketing Team\n\n- Node Type: Email Node / Whatspp\n- Purpose: Sends daily alert or report emails or whatsapp.\n- Details:\nIncludes formatted metrics and AI summary.\nEmail subject and body clearly indicate trends and recommendations.\n\n## Workflow Benefits\n\n- Fully automated daily GA reporting\n- AI-generated summaries for clear insights\n- Alerts only triggered when necessary\n- Historical logging for trends and dashboards\n- Actionable tasks automatically created in ClickUp\n- Multi-channel delivery via Email and WhatsApp\nHandles low-traffic scenarios gracefully",
