  "description": "#### This n8n template demonstrates how to capture website leads via a webhook, validate the data, optionally enrich it, store it in your CRM (HubSpot) or a simple Google Sheet, and instantly notify your team via email and Slack.\nThis is ideal for agencies, freelancers, SaaS founders, and small sales teams who want every lead recorded and followed up automatically within seconds.\n\n#### Good to know\n- The workflow supports two storage options: HubSpot or Google Sheets (choose one branch).\n- Enrichment (Clearbit/Hunter) is optional and can be disabled with a single toggle/IF branch.\n- Consider adding anti-spam (honeypot/captcha) if your form gets abused.\n\n#### How it works\n1. **Webhook receives the lead**\nYour website form sends a POST request to the Webhook URL with lead fields (name, email, message, etc.).\n2. **Validation & normalization**\nThe workflow trims and normalizes fields (like lowercasing email) and checks required fields. If invalid, it returns a ```400 response code``` immediately.\n3. **Optional enrichment (Clearbit/Hunter)**\nIf enrichment is enabled, the workflow calls an enrichment API and merges results into the lead object (industry, company size, domain, etc.).\nIf enrichment fails, the workflow continues (doesn’t block lead capture).\n4. **Save lead to CRM (Choose one)**\n- **HubSpot branch**: find contact by email → create or update the contact record\n- **Google Sheets branch**: lookup row by email → update if found → otherwise append a new row\n5. **Instant notifications**\nPosts a Slack message to a channel, optionally including a CRM/Sheet link\n6. **Success response to the website**\nReturns a ```200 response``` ```{ ok: true }``` so your website can show a “Thanks!” message.\n---\n#### How to use?\n1. Import the workflow into n8n.\n2. Configure the Webhook node and copy the production URL into your website form submit action.\n3. Choose your storage path: \n- Enable HubSpot nodes OR\n- Enable Google Sheets nodes\n4. Add credentials:\n- Slack credential\n- (Optional) HubSpot / Google Sheets\n- (Optional) Clearbit/Hunter keys in the HTTP Request node\n5. Send a test lead from your website and confirm:\n- Lead saved correctly\n- Email received\n- Slack notification posted\n- Website receives a 200 response\n---\n#### Requirements\n1. An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n2. One of:\n - HubSpot account (for CRM storage), or\n - Google account + Google Sheets (for spreadsheet storage)\n3. Slack workspace + Slack credentials\n4. Optional: Clearbit/Hunter account for enrichment",
