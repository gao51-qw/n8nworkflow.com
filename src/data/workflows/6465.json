It's a simple yet effective way to stay informed about the weather without manually checking.\n\n## How It Works\nThis workflow operates in four main steps:\n\n**Daily Schedule Trigger**:\n\nThe workflow begins with a Cron node, which acts as a scheduler.\n\nIt's configured to trigger the workflow automatically at a specific time each day (e.g., every morning at 8:00 AM).\n\nFetch Weather Data:\n\nNext, an HTTP Request node is used to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API.\n\nThis node constructs a URL to query the API for current weather conditions in a specified city (e.g., \"London\").\n\nIt includes parameters like units=metric (for Celsius temperatures) and your unique appid (API key) for authentication with OpenWeatherMap.\n\n**Format Weather Report**:\n\nA Code node receives the raw JSON weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.\n\nInside this node, JavaScript code extracts relevant information such as city name, weather description, temperature (current and \"feels like\"), humidity, and wind speed.\n\nIt then formats this information into a human-readable text string, creating the actual weather report message.\n\n**Send Email Report**:\n\nFinally, a Gmail node takes the formatted weather report from the Code node.\n\nIt uses your configured Gmail credentials to send an email to your specified recipient address.\n\nThe email's subject line dynamically includes the city name, and the body contains the full formatted weather report.\n\n## Setup Steps\nTo get this workflow up and running, follow these instructions:\n\nStep 1: Get Your OpenWeatherMap API Key\n\nGo to the OpenWeatherMap website.\n\nSign up for a free account if you don't already have one.\n\nOnce logged in, navigate to the \"API keys\" section of your profile.\n\nCopy your unique API key. You will need this in Step 4.\n\nStep 2: Create Gmail Credentials in n8n\n\nIn your n8n instance, click on Credentials in the left sidebar.\n\nClick New Credential.\n\nSearch for and select \"Gmail OAuth2 API\" or \"Gmail API\" (OAuth2 is generally preferred).\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions to connect your Gmail account. This usually involves clicking an \"Authenticate with Google\" button and granting n8n the necessary permissions. Save the credential.\n\nMake note of the Credential Name (e.g., \"My Gmail Account\").",
