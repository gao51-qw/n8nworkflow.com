Built for clubs, restaurants, agencies, or any business where clients ask questions based on a policy, FAQ, or services document.\n\n# ⚙️ How it works\n\n- Users send free-form questions to your WhatsApp Business number (e.g. “What are the gym rules?” or “Are you open today?”)\n\n- The bot automatically reads your company’s internal Google Doc (policy, schedule, etc.)\n\n- It merges the document content with today’s date and the user’s question to craft a custom AI prompt\n\n- The AI (Gemini or ChatGPT) then replies back on WhatsApp using natural, helpful language\n\n- All conversations are logged to Google Sheets for reporting or audit\n\n&gt; 💡Bonus: The AI even understands dates inside the document and compares them to today’s date — e.g. if your document says “Closed May 25 for 30 days,” it will say “We're currently closed until June 24.\n\n# 🧰 Set up steps\n\n1. Connect your WhatsApp Cloud API account (Meta)\n\n2. Add your Google account and grant access to the Doc containing your company info\n\n3. Choose your AI model (ChatGPT/OpenAI or Gemini)\n\n4. Paste your document ID into the Google Docs node\n\n\n\n5. Connect your WhatsApp webhook to Meta (only takes 5 minutes)\n\n6. Done — start receiving and answering customer questions!\n\n&gt; 📄 Works best with free-tier OpenAI/Gemini, Google Docs, and Meta's Cloud API (no phone required).
