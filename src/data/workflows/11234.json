  "description": "Template Overview This workflow demonstrates how to build a simple Telegram bot that can schedule events, check service prices, and query company documents using AI integrated with MCP and RAG. It’s designed to show how n8n can connect conversational interfaces with internal tools in a clear and scalable way.\n\nKey Concepts (explained simply):\n\nMCP (Multi‑Channel Processing): A framework that lets the AI agent connect to external services (like Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets) through MCP Clients and Servers. Think of it as the “bridge” between the bot and your tools.\n\nRAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation): A method where the AI retrieves information from documents before generating a response. This ensures answers are accurate and based on your actual data, not just the AI’s memory.\n\n⚙️ Setup Instructions (step‑by‑step)\nCreate a Telegram Bot\n\nUse BotFather to generate a bot and get the API token.\n\nConfigure Google Services\n\nMake sure you have access to Google Calendar, Docs, and Sheets.\n\nConnect them via MCP Server so the agent can call these tools.\n\nSet up Redis Memory\n\nCreate an Upstash Redis account.\n\nConfigure it in the workflow to store conversation history.\n\nImport the Template into n8n\n\nLoad the workflow and update credentials (Telegram, Google, Redis).\n\nTest the Bot\n\nSend a message like “Schedule laptop maintenance tomorrow” and check if it creates an event in Google Calendar.\n\n🛠 Troubleshooting Section\nBot not responding?\n\nVerify your Telegram API token is correct.\n\nGoogle services not working?\n\nCheck that your MCP Server is running and properly connected to Calendar, Docs, and Sheets.\n\nConversation context lost?\n\nEnsure Redis memory is configured and accessible.\n\nWrong date/time?\n\nConfirm that relative dates (“tomorrow”, “next week”) are being converted into ISO format correctly.\n\nCustomization Examples\nThis template is flexible and can be adapted to different scenarios.
