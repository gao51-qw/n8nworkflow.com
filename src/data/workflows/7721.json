It ensures that customer concerns are categorized, prioritized, and assigned to the right teams with actionable metadata.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n**Trigger & Input**\n\n- The workflow starts when a customer submits the Feedback Form containing their Name, Message, Rating, and Product/Service.\n \n- The submitted data is pre-processed with a Code node to cleanly extract fields for analysis.\n\n**AI Analysis & Processing**\n\n- The extracted review is sent to OpenAI GPT-4 for analysis.\n\n- AI identifies sentiment, sentiment score, category (e.g., product, service, support, delivery, pricing), department, priority, required actions, keywords, and suggested response tone.\n\n- A Data Processing node enriches the output with due dates, task titles, structured descriptions, and fallback handling in case of parsing issues.\n\n**Structured Output Generation**\n\n- An AI Agent and OpenAI Chat model transform the enriched data into a strict JSON format that is compatible with Monday.com, ClickUp, and HubSpot.\n\n- This ensures consistent field order, formatting, and metadata for all downstream integrations.\n\n**Task Creation in Platforms**\n\n- The structured task data is automatically pushed to:\n\n  - Monday.com → Creates an item in a specified board.\n\n  - ClickUp → Creates a task with mapped fields and priority.\n\n  - HubSpot → Creates an engagement task in CRM with due date and priority.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Automates end-to-end customer feedback analysis and task creation.\n\n- Ensures structured, AI-driven insights for actionable responses.\n\n- Reduces manual work in categorizing and assigning reviews.\n\n- Keeps customer feedback synchronized across multiple platforms (Monday.com, ClickUp, HubSpot).\n\n- Improves response time by prioritizing high-impact feedback with due dates.",
