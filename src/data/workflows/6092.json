  "description": "![Stripe n8n WF.png](fileId:1816)\n\n**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.\n\n### Introduction\nThis workflow automates Stripe checkout confirmations by capturing transaction data and syncing it into KlickTipp. Upon successful checkout, the contact's data is enriched with purchase details and tagged to trigger a personalized confirmation campaign in KlickTipp. Perfect for digital product sellers, course creators, and service providers seeking an end-to-end automated sales confirmation process.\n### Benefits\n- **Instant confirmation emails**: Automatically notify customers upon successful checkout—no manual processing needed.\n- **Structured contact data**: Order data (invoice link, amount, transaction ID, products) is stored in KlickTipp custom fields.\n- **Smart campaign triggering**: Assign dynamic tags to start automated confirmation or fulfillment sequences.\n- **Seamless digital delivery**: Ideal for pairing with tools like Memberspot or Mentortools to unlock digital products post-checkout.\n### Key Features\n- **Stripe Webhook Trigger**:\n  - Triggers on `Triggers on `Checkout Session.completed` events` events.\n  - Captures checkout data including product names, order number, and total amount.\n- **KlickTipp Contact Sync**:\n  - Adds or updates contacts in KlickTipp.\n  - Maps Stripe data into custom fields\n  - Assigns a tag such as `Stripe Checkout` to initiate a confirmation campaign.\n- **Router Logic (optional)**:\n  - Branches logic based on product ID or Stripe payment link.\n  - Enables product-specific campaigns or follow-ups.\n### Setup Instructions\n**KlickTipp Preparation**\n   - Create the following custom fields in your KlickTipp account:\n   \n| **Field Name**          | **Field Type**   |\n|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Stripe \\| Products       | Text             |\n| Stripe \\| Total          | Decimal Number   |\n| Stripe \\| Payment ID     | Text             |\n| Stripe \\| Receipt URL    | URL              |\n\n   - Define a tag for each product or confirmation flow, e.g., `Order: Course XYZ`.\n**Credential Configuration**\n     - Connect your Stripe account using an API key from the Stripe Dashboard.\n     - Authenticate your KlickTipp connection with username/password credentials (API access required).\n**Field Mapping and Workflow Alignment**\n   - Map Stripe output fields to the KlickTipp custom fields.\n   - Assign the tag to trigger your post-purchase campaign.\n   - Ensure that required data like email and opt-in info are present for the contact to be valid.\n   \n### Testing and Deployment\n1. Click on **Inactive** to activate the scenario.\n2. Perform a test payment using a Stripe product link.\n3. Verify in KlickTipp:\n   - The contact appears with email and opt-in status.\n   - Custom fields for Stripe are filled.\n   - The campaign tag is correctly applied and confirmation email is sent.\n\n⚠️ *Note*: Use real or test-mode API keys in Stripe depending on your testing environment. Stripe events may take a few seconds to propagate.\n### Campaign Expansion Ideas\n- Launch targeted upsell flows based on the product tag.\n- Use confirmation placeholders like:\n  - `[[Stripe | Products]]`\n  - `[[Stripe | Total]]`\n  - `[[Stripe | Payment ID]]`\n  - `[[Stripe | Products]]`\n- Route customers to different product access portals (e.g., Memberspot, Mentortools).\n- Send follow-up content over multiple days using KlickTipp sequences.\n### Customization\nYou can extend the scenario using a switch node to:\n- Assign different tags per used payment link\n- Branch into upsell or membership activation flows  \n- Chain additional automations like CRM entry, Slack notification, or invoice creation.\n\n\n**Resources:**  \n- [Use KlickTipp Community Node in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/install-klicktipp-node-n8n/)\n- [Automate Workflows: KlickTipp Integration in n8n](https://www.klicktipp.com/support/knowledge-base/klicktipp-integration-n8n/)\n\n\n",
