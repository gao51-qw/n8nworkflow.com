    "description": "## Automated Execution Pruning\n\nThis workflow is designed to help you manage and optimize your n8n instance by automatically pruning old workflow executions, ensuring a cleaner environment and improved performance. You can customize the retention period to suit your needs.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features:\n1. **Configurable Retention Period**:  \n   The workflow is preconfigured to delete workflow executions older than 10 days. You can easily adjust this duration by modifying the condition in the **If** node.\n\n2. **Daily Automation**:  \n   Using the **Schedule Trigger**, the workflow runs daily at the specified time (default: 4:44 AM), retrieving all workflow executions and identifying those that are older than the defined retention period.\n\n3. **On-Demand Testing**:  \n   The **Manual Trigger** allows you to test the workflow at any time, ensuring everything is working as expected.\n\n4. **Decision Making**:  \n   The **If** node evaluates each execution based on its start date and determines whether it should be deleted or retained.\n\n5. **Execution Pruning**:  \n   - **Delete Action**: Executions meeting the criteria are removed via the **Delete Execution** node.  \n   - **No-Operation**: Executions that don't meet the criteria remain untouched.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Nodes:\n1. **Manual Trigger**: Enables on-demand testing of the workflow.  \n2. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs the workflow daily at the configured time.  \n3. **n8n List Execution**: Fetches all executions in your n8n instance.  \n4. **If Node**: Compares the execution's start date with the configured retention period.  \n5. **Delete Execution**: Deletes executions older than the specified retention period.  \n6. **No Operation**: Serves as a placeholder for executions that don't meet the pruning criteria.  \n\n---\n\n## How to Customize:\n- **Retention Period**:  \n   Update the **If** node's condition to modify the retention period. For instance, change `10 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` to the desired number of days in milliseconds.\n   \n- **Schedule**:  \n   Adjust the timing of the **Schedule Trigger** to match your preferred automation schedule.\n\nThis workflow ensures your instance remains efficient by keeping only the relevant execution logs. Use it to maintain a streamlined and clutter-free environment effortlessly.",
