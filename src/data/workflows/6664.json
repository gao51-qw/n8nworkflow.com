  "description": "**How it works\n**\nThis intelligent workflow acts as your personal shopping assistant, helping you quickly research products and find potential purchasing options based on your detailed descriptions. It automatically:\n\n- Takes your natural language product description (e.g., \"a durable, lightweight hiking backpack for multi-day trips with good ventilation\").\n\n- Uses AI to generate optimized search queries to find relevant products online.\n\n- Executes these searches across Google's index.\n\n- Analyzes the top search results (titles and snippets) using AI to identify common product types, features, and potential retailers.\n\n- Compiles a concise summary report with key insights and direct links to relevant product pages.\n\n- Delivers the full report to your inbox, guiding you to the next steps for purchasing.\n\nSave time on product research and get smarter recommendations for your next purchase!\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nSetting up this workflow is more advanced than previous ones due to integrating with a specialized search API, typically taking around 30-60 minutes. You'll need to:\n\n- Set up a Google Custom Search Engine (CSE): This involves creating a CSE in your Google Cloud Platform and obtaining an API Key and Search Engine ID. Detailed instructions are provided within the workflow.\n\n- Obtain API keys for your preferred AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).\n\n- Connect your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail) to receive the report.\n\n- Provide a clear and detailed description of the product you're looking for.\n\nAll detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance, including the CSE setup, are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.",
