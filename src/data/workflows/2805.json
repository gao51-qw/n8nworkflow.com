Copy your Todoist API token ([found here](https://app.todoist.com/app/settings/integrations/developer)).\n2. Create a **Todoist API** credential in n8n.\n3. Create an **SMTP** credential in n8n.\n   - Alternatively, use a preferred email service like Brevo, Mailjet, etc.\n4. Import this workflow template.\n5. In the **Get completed tasks via Todoist API** step, select your Todoist API credential.\n6. In the **Send Email** step:\n   - Select your SMTP credential.\n   - Set the sender and recipient email addresses.\n7. Run the workflow manually and check your inbox!\n\n### Ignoring specific projects\nIf you do not want your grocery list, workouts, or other tasks from specific Todoist projects showing up in your weekly summary, modify the step called **Optional: Ignore specific projects** and change this line:\n\n```\nconst ignoredProjects = ['2335544024'];\n```\n\nThis should be an array with the `id` of each project you'd like to ignore.
