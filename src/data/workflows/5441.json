  "description": "# Automate Drafts From Google Drive \n\nThis workflow automates the end-to-end process of extracting and summarizing information from PDFs stored in a specific Google Drive folder. When a new PDF or any binary data is added, the workflow is triggered and begins by downloading and processing the PDF to extract all available text. If multiple PDFs are detected, their content is aggregated into a single, combined dataset. This automation eliminates the time consuming task of manually reading, taking notes, and drafting documents. By removing this burden, users can focus on more meaningful tasks while the workflow handles the repetitive, tedious work.\n\nThe extracted content is then passed through an AI-powered information extractor that identifies key details such as names, dates, addresses, and any other structured data points the user wants to extract from the PDF. This step is highly customizable, allowing the user to define exactly what type of information should be extracted. While the workflow is designed to extract all available content from the PDF, specifying additional structured data points ensures that critical details are accurately captured. A second OpenAI Node uses the extracted information to draft a professional, formal summary suitable for documentation. This is the most important part of the workflow and can be fully customized to meet the user's specific needs. By editing the prompts, users can tailor the workflow to generate a wide variety of draft formats based on the extracted content. \n\nThe workflow then generates a new Google Document containing the full draft and composes an email summarizing the key points in 3 to 5 bullet points. This email is automatically sent to the designated recipient along with a direct link to the Google Doc. This solution is ideal for insurance, legal, or administrative use cases where timely, accurate extraction and reporting from incoming PDFs is essential.\n\n**How To Use The Workflow**\nStep 1 - Place any binary data (e.g., PDF files) into the designated Google Drive folder.\n\nStep 2 - The workflow will automatically download each PDF, extract the text, and if multiple PDFs are present combine them into a single dataset for analysis.\n\nStep 3 - The OpenAI Draft Agent will analyze the extracted information, generate a formal draft, and create a Google Document. This document will be updated with the draft content and saved back into the same Google Drive folder.\n\nStep 4 - An email will be sent to the designated recipient(s), including a summary of the draft and key extracted information, along with a link to view the Google Document.\n\n**Need Help?
