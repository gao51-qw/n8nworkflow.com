  "description": "# Telegram AI Assistant: Summarize Links & Generate Images On Demand\n\nThis workflow turns any Telegram chat into a smart assistant. By typing simple commands like `/summary` or `/img`, users can trigger powerful AI actions—directly from Telegram.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n\nThis automation listens for specific commands in Telegram messages:\n\n- `/help`: Sends a help menu explaining available commands.\n- `/summary &lt;link&gt;`: Fetches a webpage, extracts its content, and summarizes it using OpenAI into 10–12 bullet points.\n- `/img &lt;prompt&gt;`: Sends the image prompt to OpenAI and replies that the request has been received (designed for future integration with image APIs).\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Features\n\n- ✅ Works instantly in Telegram  \n- 🧠 Uses OpenAI for text summarization and image prompt processing  \n- 🌐 Scrapes and cleans raw article text before summarizing  \n- 📤 Replies directly to the same Telegram thread  \n- 🔧 Easily expandable to support more commands  \n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Use Cases\n\n- **Research Summaries**: Quickly condense articles or reports shared in chat.  \n- **Content Review**: Get team-friendly TL;DRs of long blog posts or product pages.  \n- **Creative Brainstorming**: Share visual ideas via `/img` and get quick prompts logged.  \n- **Customer Support**: Offer instant answers in group chats (with further extension).  \n- **Daily Digest Bot**: Connect to news feeds and auto-summarize updates.  \n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n1. Clone this workflow and connect your Telegram Bot.  \n2. Insert your OpenAI credentials.  \n3. Deploy and test by messaging `/summary https://example.com` in your Telegram group or DM.  \n4. Expand with new commands or connect Stability.ai or other services for real image generation.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Author & Resources\n\nBuilt by [Yaron Been](https://www.youtube.com/@YaronBeen/videos)  \nFollow more automations at [nofluff.online](https://nofluff.online)\n",
