This workflow is designed for teams building AI tools or copilots that need seamless access to Bubble backend data via natural language queries.\n\n\n**How it works**\n- Triggered via a webhook from an AI agent using the MCP (Model-Chain Prompt) protocol.\n- The agent selects the appropriate data tool (e.g., projects, user, bookings) based on user intent.\n- The workflow queries your Bubble database and returns the result.\n- Ideal for integrating with ChatGPT, n8n AI-Agents, assistants, or autonomous workflows that need real-time access to app data.\n\n\n**Set up steps**\n- Enable access to your Bubble data or backend APIs (as needed).\n- Create a Bubble admin token.\n- Add your Bubble node/s to your n8n workflow.\n- Add your Bubble admin token.\n- Configer your Bubble node/s.\n- Copy the generated webhook URL from the MCP Server Trigger node and register it with your AI tool (e.g., LangChain tool loader).\n- (Optional) Adjust filters in the “Get an Object Details” node to match your dataset needs.\n\nOnce connected, your AI agents can automatically retrieve context-aware data from your Bubble app, no manual lookups required.\n\n",
