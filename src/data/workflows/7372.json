  "description": "# Automated trend monitoring for content strategy\n\n## Who's it for\nContent creators, marketers, and social media managers who want to stay ahead of emerging trends and generate relevant content ideas based on data-driven insights.\n\n## What it does\nThis workflow automatically identifies trending topics related to your industry, collects recent news articles about these trends, and generates content suggestions. It transforms raw trend data into actionable editorial opportunities by analyzing search volume growth and current news coverage.\n\n## How it works\nThe workflow follows a three-step automation process:\nTrend Analysis: Examines searches related to your topics and identifies those with the strongest recent growth\nArticle Collection: Searches Google News for current articles about emerging trends and scrapes their full content\nContent Generation: Creates personalized content suggestions based on collected articles and trend data\nThe system automatically excludes geo-localized searches to provide a global perspective on trends, though this can be customized.\n\n## Requirements\nSerpAPI account (for trend and news data)\nFirecrawl API key (for scraping article content from Google News results)\nGoogle Sheets access\nAI model API key (for content analysis and recommendations - you can use any LLM provider you prefer)\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Step 1: Prepare your tracking sheet\nDuplicate this Google Sheets template \nRename your copy and ensure it's accessible\n\n### Step 2: Configure API credentials\nBefore running the workflow, set up the following credentials in n8n:\nSerpAPI: For trend analysis and Google News search\nFirecrawl API: For scraping article content\nAI Model API: For content analysis and recommendations (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, or any other LLM provider)\nGoogle Sheets OAuth2: For accessing and updating your tracking spreadsheet\n\n### Step 3: Configure your monitoring topics\nIn your Google Sheet \"Query\" tab:\n\nQuery column: Enter the main topics/keywords you want to monitor for trending queries (e.g., \"digital marketing\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"sustainable fashion\")\nQuery to avoid column: Optionally add specific queries you want to exclude from trend analysis (e.g., brand names, irrelevant terms, or overly specific searches that don't match your content strategy)\n\nThis step is crucial as these queries will be the foundation for discovering related trending topics.\n\n### Step 4: Configure the workflow\nIn the \"Get Query\" node, paste your duplicated Google Sheets URL in the \"Document\" field\nEnsure your Google Sheet contains your monitoring topics in the Query column\n\n### Step 5: Customize language and location settings\n\nThe workflow is currently configured for French content and France location. You can modify these settings in the SerpAPI nodes:\nLanguage (hl): Change from \"fr\" to your preferred language code\nGeographic location (geo/gl): Change from \"FR\" to your target country code\nDate range: Currently set to \"today 1-m\" (last month) but can be adjusted\n\n### Step 6: Adjust filtering (optional)\nThe \"Sorting Queries\" node excludes geo-localized queries by default. You can modify the AI agent's instructions to include location-specific queries or change filtering criteria based on your requirements. The system will also automatically exclude any queries you've listed in the \"Query to avoid\" column.\n\n### Step 7: Configure scheduling (optional)\nThe workflow includes an automated scheduler that runs monthly (1st day of each month at 8 AM). You can modify the cron expression 0 8 1 * * in the Schedule Trigger node to change:\nFrequency (daily, weekly, monthly)\nTime of execution\nDay of the month\n\n## How to customize the workflow\nChange trend count: The workflow processes up to 10 related queries per topic but filters them through AI to select the most relevant non-geolocalized ones\nAdjust article collection: Currently collects exactly 3 news articles per query for analysis\nContent style: Customize the AI prompts in content generation nodes to match your brand voice\nOutput format: Modify the Google Sheets structure to include additional data points\nAI model: Replace the Anthropic model with your preferred LLM provider\nScraping options: Configure Firecrawl settings to extract specific content elements from articles\n\n## Results interpretation\nFor each monitored topic, the workflow generates a separate sheet named by month and topic (e.g., \"January Digital Marketing\") containing:\nData structure (four columns):\nQuery: The trending search term ranked by growth\nÉvolution: Growth percentage over the last month\nNews: Links to 3 relevant news articles\nIdée: AI-generated content suggestions based on comprehensive article analysis\nThe workflow provides monthly retrospective analysis, helping you identify emerging topics before competitors and optimize your content calendar with high-potential subjects.\n\n## Workflow limitations\nProcesses up to 10 related queries per topic with AI filtering\nCollects exactly 3 news articles per query\nResults are automatically organized in monthly sheets\nRequires stable internet connection for API calls",
