  "description": "### How It Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow is a comprehensive, AI-powered system that acts as a virtual patient assistant for clinics. It automates the entire patient journey from appointment confirmation to post-procedure follow-up.\n\n1.  **Appointment Trigger**: The workflow starts when a new event is created in your **Google Calendar** for a patient appointment.\n2.  **AI-Powered Education**: The new appointment is sent to an **OpenAI (GPT-4)** node, which acts as a virtual clinic assistant. It instantly generates a personalized pre-procedure guide based on the appointment's details.\n3.  **Automated Communication**: The workflow then uses **Twilio** to send this AI-generated guide directly to the patient via SMS or WhatsApp, ensuring they are well-prepared for their appointment.\n4.  **Post-Procedure Follow-up**: After the appointment ends, a `Wait` node pauses the workflow for a set period. It then sends a personalized follow-up message—also generated by **OpenAI**—to the patient, encouraging them to provide feedback.\n5.  **Staff Notification**: A **Slack** notification is sent to the team once a follow-up message has been dispatched, keeping everyone informed and ready to act on incoming feedback.\n\n### How to Set Up 🛠️\n\n1.  **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n2.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    * **Google Calendar**: Add your OAuth2 credential.\n    * **OpenAI**: Add your API Key.\n    * **Twilio**: Add your API credentials.\n    * **Slack**: Add your Bot Token credential.\n3.  **Customize Workflow Nodes**:\n    * **Node 1 (`Google Calendar Trigger`)**: Select your clinic's booking calendar.\n    * **Node 2 & 5 (`OpenAI`)**: You can customize the prompts to better match your clinic's tone and specific procedures.\n    * **Node 3 & 6 (`Twilio`)**: Replace `YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER` with your Twilio number and ensure you can extract the patient's phone number from your calendar events (e.g., from the event description).\n    * **Node 7 (`Slack`)**: Replace `YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` with the ID of your team's feedback or operations channel.\n4.  **Save & Activate**: Once all settings and credentials are configured, save the workflow and click the \"Inactive\" toggle in the top-right corner to make it live.",
