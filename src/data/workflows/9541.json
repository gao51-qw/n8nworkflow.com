  "description": "\n\n***\n\n# **Animate Any Face into a Video with Fal.ai**\n*Create stunning deepfake-style videos automatically by swapping a face from an image onto a source video.*\n\nThis workflow provides a powerful, automated pipeline to perform video face-swapping using the Fal.ai API. It's designed to handle the entire asynchronous process: accepting a source video and a target face image, uploading them to cloud storage, initiating the AI job, polling for completion, and retrieving the final, rendered video.\n\n| **Services Used** | **Features** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 🤖 **Fal.ai** | Leverages the powerful Wan 2.2 model for high-quality face animation. |\n| ☁️ **AWS S3** | Uses enterprise-grade cloud storage for reliable public file hosting. |\n| 🔄 **Polling Loop** | Intelligently waits for the asynchronous AI job to complete before proceeding. |\n| 📥 **n8n Form Trigger** | Provides a simple UI to upload your source image and video. |\n\n---\n\n## How It Works ⚙️\n\n1.  **📥 Get User Input**: The workflow starts when you upload a source video and a face image via the **n8n Form Trigger**.\n2.  **☁️ Upload to Cloud**: Both files are automatically uploaded to a specified **AWS S3 bucket** to generate the publicly accessible URLs required by the AI model.\n3.  **🚀 Start AI Job**: The public URLs for the video and image are sent in an **HTTP Request** to the Fal.ai API, which starts the asynchronous face animation process and returns a `request_id`.\n4.  **⏳ Wait & Check**: The workflow enters a polling loop. It **Waits** for one minute, then makes another **HTTP Request** to the Fal.ai status endpoint using the `request_id`.\n5.  **✅ Check for Completion**: An **IF** node checks if the job status is `COMPLETED`. If not, the workflow loops back to the Wait node.\n6.  **🎬 Retrieve Final Video**: Once the job is complete, the workflow makes a final **HTTP Request** to fetch the finished animated video.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to Set Up\n\n1.  **🔑 Set Up Fal.ai Credentials**: Get your API Key from [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai/). In n8n, go to **Credentials**, add a new **Header Auth** credential, and save your key. Connect this credential to all three `HTTP Request` nodes in the workflow.\n2.  **☁️ Configure AWS S3**: Add your AWS credentials in n8n. In the two **AWS S3** nodes (`Upload Video1` and `Upload Image1`), update the **Bucket Name** parameter to your own S3 bucket. Ensure your bucket permissions allow for public reads.\n3.  **▶️ Activate and Run**: Activate the workflow. Open the **Form Trigger** URL from the n8n editor, upload your files, and submit. The final video will be available in the execution log of the `Get Final Video` node.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n*   An active **Fal.ai** account and API key.\n*   An **AWS account** with an S3 bucket configured for public access.\n*   **Alternative Storage:** For a personal setup, you can replace the AWS S3 nodes with **Cloudinary** nodes. Just ensure the output is a public URL.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Need Help or Want to Learn More?\n\n*   Join my **Skool community** for n8n + AI automation tutorials, live Q&A sessions, and exclusive workflows:\n    👉 https://www.skool.com/n8n-ai-automation-champions\n\n---\n\n**Template Author:** Sandeep Patharkar  \n**Category:** Content Generation / Content Marketing\n**Difficulty:** Intermediate  \n**Estimated Setup Time:** ⏱️ 20 minutes",
