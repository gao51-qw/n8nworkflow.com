  "description": "# **Domain Outbound Machine: Automate Lead Generation, Email Extraction, and Targeted Outreach with n8n**\n\n## **Description**  \n**Domain Outbound Machine** is an n8n workflow designed to fully automate the domain sales process: lead generation, email extraction, personalized outreach, and automated email sending. It also stores extracted email addresses and sent emails in an Excel file for tracking and follow-up.\n\n## **How It Works?**\n\n### **1. Domain Input**  \nYou provide the domain name you want to sell. The workflow takes this domain as the starting point.\n\n### **2. Google Maps Query Generation**  \nThe workflow automatically generates 100 Google Maps queries based on the domain's niche or industry. This ensures you target businesses or individuals who might be interested in acquiring the domain.\n\n### **3. Web Scraping for Emails**  \nUsing the generated queries, the workflow scrapes relevant websites to extract email addresses. This step ensures you have a targeted list of potential buyers.\n\n### **4. Email Enrichment**  \nFor each extracted email, the workflow gathers publicly available information (e.g., LinkedIn, company websites) to enhance personalization.\n\n### **5. Personalized Email Creation**  \nBased on the enriched data, the workflow crafts a custom email for each lead, emphasizing the domain’s value, its relevance to their business, and a compelling call-to-action.\n\n### **6. Email Sending via Gmail**  \nThe workflow sends the personalized emails directly through your Gmail account, ensuring timely and professional outreach.\n\n### **7. Email & Lead Tracking in Excel**  \nAll extracted email addresses and sent messages are automatically stored in an Excel file, allowing you to track responses and manage follow-ups efficiently.\n\n## **Key Features**\n✅ **Automated Lead Generation** – Saves time by automatically finding and extracting potential leads.  \n✅ **Personalized Outreach** – Boosts engagement by tailoring each email to the recipient.  \n✅ **Seamless Integration** – Uses n8n’s automation to connect Google Maps, web scraping tools, and Gmail in one workflow.  \n✅ **Scalable & Trackable** – Adjust the number of queries or emails as needed, while keeping track of everything in Excel.  \n\n**Domain Outbound Machine** is perfect for domain investors, digital marketers, and anyone looking to sell domains efficiently. By automating the tedious tasks, you can focus on closing deals and growing your business.\n",
