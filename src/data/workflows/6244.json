It's perfect for:\n- Backing up files from remote servers\n- Migrating data from FTP to cloud storage\n- Automating file synchronization tasks\n- Creating scheduled backups of server content\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe workflow follows these steps:\n\n1. **Manual Trigger** - You start the process by clicking \"Execute\"\n2. **Lists FTP Directory** - Scans the specified FTP folder for all items\n3. **Filters Files Only** - Separates actual files from directories (folders)\n4. **Downloads Files** - Retrieves each file as binary data from the FTP server\n5. **Uploads to Google Drive** - Stores all downloaded files in your specified Google Drive folder\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore using this template, you'll need:\n\n- **FTP Server Access**: Server address, username, and password\n- **Google Drive Account**: With OAuth2 authentication set up in n8n\n- **n8n Instance**: Self-hosted or cloud version\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Configure FTP Credentials\n\n1. In n8n, go to **Settings** → **Credentials**\n2. Create a new **FTP** credential\n3. Enter your FTP server details:\n   - **Host**: Your FTP server address\n   - **Port**: Usually 21 for FTP\n   - **Username**: Your FTP username\n   - **Password**: Your FTP password\n4. Test the connection and save\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Google Drive Authentication\n\n1. Create a new **Google Drive OAuth2** credential\n2. Follow n8n's Google Drive setup guide:\n   - Create a Google Cloud project\n   - Enable Google Drive API\n   - Create OAuth2 credentials\n   - Add your n8n callback URL\n3. Authorize the connection in n8n\n\n### Step 3: Configure the Workflow\n\n1. **Update FTP Path**: \n   - Open the \"List FTP Directory\" node\n   - Change the `path` parameter from `/_instalki` to your desired FTP folder\n\n2. **Set Google Drive Folder**:\n   - Open the \"Upload to Google Drive\" node\n   - Replace the `folderId` with your target Google Drive folder ID\n   - To find folder ID: Open the folder in Google Drive and copy the ID from the URL\n\n3. **Assign Credentials**:\n   - Ensure both FTP nodes use your FTP credential\n   - Assign your Google Drive credential to the upload node\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Test First**: Run the workflow manually with a few test files\n2. **Monitor Execution**: Check the execution log for any errors\n3. **Verify Upload**: Confirm files appear in your Google Drive folder\n4. **Schedule (Optional)**: Add a schedule trigger if you want automatic runs\n\n## Customization Options\n\n### Filter Specific File Types\nAdd a condition after \"Filter Files Only\" to process only certain file extensions:\n```\n{{ $json.name.endsWith('.pdf') || $json.name.endsWith('.jpg') }}\n```\n\n### Add Error Handling\nInsert error-handling nodes to manage failed downloads or uploads gracefully.\n\n### Organize by Date\nModify the Google Drive upload to create date-based folders automatically.\n\n### File Size Limits\nAdd checks for file size before attempting upload (Google Drive has limits).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Common Issues:**\n\n- **FTP Connection Failed**: Check server address, port, and credentials\n- **Google Drive Upload Error**: Verify OAuth2 setup and folder permissions\n- **Files Not Found**: Ensure the FTP path exists and contains files\n- **Large Files**: Consider Google Drive's file size limitations (15GB for free accounts)\n\n**Tips:**\n- Test with small files first\n- Check n8n execution logs for detailed error messages\n- Ensure your Google Drive has sufficient storage space\n- Verify FTP server allows multiple concurrent connections\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- Never hardcode credentials in the workflow\n- Use n8n's credential system for all authentication\n- Consider using SFTP instead of FTP for better security\n- Regularly rotate your FTP passwords\n- Review Google Drive sharing permissions\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have this basic transfer working, you might want to:\n- Add email notifications for successful/failed transfers\n- Implement file deduplication checks\n- Create logs of transferred files\n- Set up automatic cleanup of old files\n- Add file compression before upload",
