  "description": "## 📌 Overview\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis powerful workflow automates your sales quotation process by connecting Pipedrive with DottedSign. When a deal is moved to a specific stage in Pipedrive, this template automatically generates a professional PDF quotation, uploads it back to the deal, and sends it out for e-signature via DottedSign service, saving your sales team valuable time and eliminating manual work.\n\n## What it does\n\nWhen a Pipedrive deal moves to a designated stage (e.g., \"Quotation Stage\"), this workflow triggers and performs the following actions:\n1.  **Gathers Data:** It collects all relevant information, including deal details, client contacts, organization info, and associated products from Pipedrive.\n2.  **Generates PDF Quote:** It populates a customizable HTML template with the collected data and uses a PDF generation service (Gotenberg) to create a polished PDF document.\n3.  **Uploads to Pipedrive:** The generated PDF quote is automatically uploaded to the \"Files\" section of the corresponding Pipedrive deal for record-keeping.\n4.  **Sends for E-Signature:** It creates a new signing task in DottedSign, sending the quotation to the client for their electronic signature.\n\n## Requirements\n\n-   A Pipedrive account with admin permissions.\n-   A DottedSign developer account to obtain API credentials.\n-   A self-hosted instance of [Gotenberg](https://gotenberg.dev/docs/getting-started/installation) for HTML to PDF conversion.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1.  **Pipedrive Trigger Stage:** In the `If` node, change the stage ID `7` to the ID of the pipeline stage you want to use as the trigger.\n2.  **PDF Conversion Service:** In the `Gotenberg to PDF` (HTTP Request) node, replace the placeholder URL with the endpoint of your running Gotenberg instance.\n3.  **DottedSign Credentials:** In the `Get DottedSign Access Token` node, enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` in the request body.\n4.  **DottedSign Signature Field:** In the `Create DottedSign Task` node, you **must** adjust the `page` and `coord` values under `field_settings` to match the desired signature location on your PDF template.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n-   **Quotation Template:** Edit the `Generate Quotation HTML` node to modify the quote's appearance, text, company logo, and terms. The `{{ ... }}` expressions are placeholders that are filled with Pipedrive data.\n-   **Trigger:** Replace the Pipedrive Trigger with another trigger, such as a webhook or a form submission, to adapt the workflow to different needs.\n-   **Notifications:** Add a Slack or email node at the end of the workflow to notify the sales team once the quotation has been sent.\n",
