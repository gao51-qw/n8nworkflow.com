  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n# 🚀 Automating Google Maps Lead Generation with n8n + Apify\n\nFinding quality leads can be time-consuming. What if you could *scrape restaurant data from Google Maps, filter the best ones, and email a Morning Brew–style newsletter automatically*?  \n\nThat’s exactly what this **n8n workflow** does.\n\n\n## 🔎 What This Workflow Does\n\n* Takes a location input (Bangkok or Bareilly in this case)  \n* Runs a Google Maps scraper via [Apify Actor](https://apify.com/)  \n* Extracts restaurant essentials (name, category, rating, reviews, address, phone, Google Maps link)  \n* Sorts & filters results (only high-review, highly-rated places)  \n* Saves data to Airtable for lead management  \n* Uses AI to generate a newsletter in a Morning Brew–style HTML email  \n* Emails the newsletter automatically to your chosen recipients  \n\n\n\n## 🛠️ Workflow Breakdown\n\n### 1. Form Trigger\n* User selects location from a dropdown (Bangkok or Bareilly)  \n* Submits form to kickstart the process  \n\n### 2.

Extract & Transform Data\n* n8n **Set node** extracts only the essentials  \n* Formats them into a clean text block (`Restaurant_Data`)  \n\n### 4. Sort & Filter\n* **Sorted by**:  \n  * Review Count (descending)  \n  * Rating (descending)  \n* **Filter**: Only restaurants with *500+ reviews*  \n\n### 5. Airtable Lead Storage\n* Each record is saved to **Google Map Leads - Restaurants** Airtable table  \n* Fields include:  \n  * Title  \n  * Category  \n  * Price Range  \n  * Rating  \n  * Review Count  \n  * Address  \n  * Phone  \n  * Location  \n\n### 6.

Automatic Email\n* Gmail node sends the newsletter directly to your inbox  \n* Example recipient: `prath002@gmail.com`  \n\n\n\n## 🎯 Why This Workflow Rocks\n\n* **End-to-End Automation**: From scraping → filtering → emailing, no manual effort  \n* **Lead Enrichment**: Only keeps high-quality restaurants with strong social proof  \n* **Scalable**: Works for any city you plug into the form  \n* **Engaging Output**: AI crafts the results into a ready-to-send newsletter  \n\n\n\n## 🔮 Next Steps\n\n* Add more cities to the dropdown for multi-location scraping  \n* Customize the email template for branding  \n* Integrate with **CRM tools** for automated outreach  \n\n\n\n👉 With just a few clicks, you can go from **raw Google Maps data → polished newsletter → fresh leads in Airtable**.  \n\nThat’s the power of **n8n + Apify + AI**.\n",
