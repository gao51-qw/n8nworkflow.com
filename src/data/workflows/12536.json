  "description": "This workflow demonstrates how to create **viral AI-generated selfie videos featuring famous characters** using a fully automated and platform-independent approach.\n\nThe process is designed to replicate the kind of celebrity selfie videos that are currently going viral on social media and YouTube, where a **realistic selfie-style video** appears to show the creator together with a well-known **public figure**.\n\nInstead of relying on a proprietary or closed platform, the workflow explains how to build the entire pipeline using direct access to **Google Veo 3.1** APIs, giving full control over generation, orchestration, and distribution.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Key Advantages\n\n#### 1. ✅ Fully automated video pipeline\n\nFrom prompt to final published video, the entire process runs without manual intervention.\n\n#### 2. ✅ Spreadsheet-driven control\n\nNon-technical users can manage video production simply by editing Google Sheets:\n\n* Add new prompts\n* Adjust duration\n* Control merge logic\n\n#### 3. ✅ Scalable and modular\n\n* Supports batch processing of many videos\n* Easy to extend with new AI models, platforms, or output formats\n\n#### 4. ✅ Reliable async handling\n\n* Built-in wait and status-check logic ensures robustness\n* Prevents failures caused by long-running AI jobs\n#### 5. ✅ Centralized asset management\n\n* Automatically stores video URLs and statuses\n* Keeps production data organized and auditable\n#### 6. ✅ Multi-platform ready\n\n* One generated video can be reused for:\n\n  * YouTube\n  * TikTok\n  * Instagram\n  * Other social channels\n\n#### 7. ✅ Cost and time efficiency\n\n* Eliminates repetitive manual video editing\n* Reduces production time from hours to minutes\n\n\n#### Ideal Use Cases\n\n* AI-generated storytelling videos\n* Social media content automation\n* Marketing video campaigns\n* Short-form video experiments at scale\n* Faceless or semi-automated content channels\n\n---\n\n### **How it Works**\n\nThis workflow automates the generation of short video clips using AI, merges them into a final video, and optionally uploads the result to multiple platforms.\n\n1. **Trigger & Data Fetching**  \n   The workflow starts with a manual trigger. It reads a Google Sheet containing prompts, image URLs (first and last frames), and duration settings for each video clip to be generated.\n\n2. **Video Clip Generation**  \n   For each row in the sheet, the workflow calls the **fal.ai VEO 3.1 API** to generate a video clip based on the provided prompt, start image, end image, and duration. The clip is created asynchronously, so the workflow polls the API for status until completion.\n\n3. **Status Polling & URL Retrieval**  \n   Once a clip is marked as `COMPLETED`, its video URL is fetched and written back to the Google Sheet in the corresponding row.\n\n4. **Video Merging**  \n   After all clips are generated, the workflow collects the video URLs from rows marked for merging and sends them to the **fal.ai FFmpeg API** to be combined into a single video.\n\n5. **Final Video Processing**  \n   The merged video is polled until ready, then its final URL is retrieved. The video file is downloaded via HTTP request.\n\n6. **Upload & Distribution**  \n   The final video can be uploaded to:\n   - Google Drive\n   - YouTube (via [upload-post.com API](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app))\n   - [Postiz](https://affiliate.postiz.com/n3witalia) (for multi-platform social media posting)\n   Each upload step is currently disabled and requires configuration (usernames, titles, platform settings).\n\n**WARNING**\nIt may happen that the workflow stops at the video generation node with the following message:\n\n&gt; *Your request is invalid or could not be processed by the service [item 0]*\n&gt; *The content could not be processed because it contained material flagged by a content checker.*\n\nThis occurs because images are checked both **before and after** the video generation process.\nIf this happens, you can either use **less restrictive video models** while keeping the same workflow structure, or **change the source images** in the Google Sheets file. \n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\n1. **Google Sheets Setup**  \n   - Prepare a Google Sheet with columns:  \n     `START`, `LAST`, `PROMPT`, `DURATION`, `VIDEO URL`, `MERGE`\n   - Connect n8n to Google Sheets using OAuth2 credentials.\n\n2. **Fal.ai API Configuration**  \n   - Obtain an API key from fal.ai.\n   - Set up **HTTP Header Auth** credentials in n8n with the key.\n\n3. **Upload Services Configuration**  \n   - **Google Drive**: Configure OAuth2 credentials and specify the target folder ID.\n   - [**YouTube/upload-post.com**](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app): Enter your username and title in the respective node.\n   - [**Postiz**](https://affiliate.postiz.com/n3witalia): Set up Postiz API credentials and configure platform channels.\n\n4. **Enable Required Nodes**  \n   - Enable the upload nodes (`Upload Video`, `Upload to Youtube`, `Upload to Postiz`, `Upload to Social`) once credentials are configured.\n\n5. **Adjust Polling Intervals**  \n   - Modify wait times (`Wait 30 sec.`, `Wait 60 sec.`) as needed based on video processing times.\n\n6. **Test Execution**  \n   - Start the workflow manually via the trigger node.\n   - Monitor execution in n8n’s editor and check the Google Sheet for updated video URLs.\n\nThis workflow is designed for batch video creation and merging, ideal for content \npipelines involving AI-generated media.\n\n---\n\n👉 [Subscribe to my new **YouTube channel**](https://youtube.com/@n3witalia).
