  "description": "This n8n workflow provides a ready-to-use API endpoint for extracting structured data from images. It processes an image URL using an AI-powered OCR model and returns the extracted details in a structured JSON format.  \n\n### **Use Cases**  \n- **Document OCR** – Extract details from ID cards, invoices, receipts, etc.  \n- **Text Extraction from Images** – Process screenshots, scanned documents, and photos.  \n- **Automated Form Processing** – Digitize and capture information from paper forms.  \n- **Business Card Data Extraction** – Extract names, emails, and phone numbers from business cards.  \n\n## How It Works  \n1. Send a GET request with an image URL and define the required extraction parameters.  \n2. The image is converted to base64 for processing.  \n3. The AI model (Gemini API - Flash Lite) extracts relevant text.  \n4. The response returns structured JSON data containing only the requested fields.  \n\n## Features  \n✔️ **No-Code API Setup** – Easily integrate into any application.  \n✔️ **Customizable Extraction** – Modify the request parameters to fit your needs.  \n✔️ **AI-Powered OCR** – Uses advanced models for accurate text recognition.  \n✔️ **Automated Processing** – Ideal for document processing and digitization.  \n\n## Integration  \n- Works with any frontend/backend system that supports API calls.  \n- Can be used for workflow automation in CRM, ERP, and document management solutions.  \n- Supports further customization based on specific OCR requirements.
