Ideal for users who want to maintain a clean, organized inbox while ensuring important emails are properly categorized and promotional emails are handled appropriately.\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow creates an **intelligent email organization system** that automatically processes and categorizes your Gmail inbox using customizable rules stored in Google Sheets. The system:\n\n1. **Triggers automatically on a schedule** (configurable interval) to check for new emails\n2. **Retrieves all unread emails** from your Gmail inbox\n3. **Parses sender email addresses** to extract clean email addresses from various formats\n4. **Loads organization rules** from a Google Sheets document with customizable patterns\n5. **Applies intelligent pattern matching** to categorize emails based on sender patterns\n6. **Executes appropriate actions** (DELETE, PROMO, or LABEL) based on matched rules\n7. **Manages Gmail labels** automatically, creating new labels if needed\n8. **Removes processed emails from inbox** and marks them as read\n9. **Sends completion notifications** via Slack for monitoring\n\n**Key Innovation: Sheet-Based Rule Management** - Unlike traditional email filters that require complex setup in Gmail, this system uses Google Sheets for easy rule management, allowing non-technical users to update email organization rules through a simple spreadsheet interface.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1. Configure Gmail API Credentials\n- Set up Gmail OAuth2 API credentials in n8n\n- Ensure the account has permissions to read, modify, and manage Gmail messages\n- Grant access to Gmail labels and message operations\n\n### 2. Set up Google Sheets Integration\n- Create a Google Sheets document for email organization rules\n- Set up Google Sheets OAuth2 API credentials in n8n\n- Configure the sheet with the required columns: Pattern, Action, LabelName, RemoveFromInbox\n\n### 3. Configure Email Organization Rules\n- Add your email organization rules to the Google Sheets document\n- Use the Pattern column to specify sender patterns (e.g., \"@company.com\", \"newsletter@\")\n- Set Action to DELETE, PROMO, or LABEL based on desired behavior\n- Specify LabelName for custom labels when Action is LABEL\n- Set RemoveFromInbox to TRUE/FALSE to control inbox removal\n\n### 4. Set up Slack Notifications (Optional)\n- Configure Slack API credentials for the notification channel\n- Update the channel ID where completion notifications will be sent\n- Customize notification messages as needed\n\n### 5. Configure Schedule\n- Adjust the Schedule Trigger node for your preferred interval\n- Consider running every few minutes for real-time organization\n- Test with manual execution first to verify setup\n\n### 6. Test the Integration\n- Run a manual execution to verify all components work correctly\n- Check your Gmail inbox and labels to see organized emails\n- Verify Slack notifications are received (if configured)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud) with API access\n- **Gmail account** with API access and sufficient email volume\n- **Google Sheets account** for rule management\n- **Slack workspace** for notifications (optional but recommended)\n- **Gmail labels** that need to be created and managed automatically\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify Email Processing Frequency\n- Adjust the Schedule Trigger node for different intervals (every few minutes, hourly, daily)\n- Add multiple schedule triggers for different email types\n- Implement conditional scheduling based on email volume\n\n### Enhance Rule Management\n- Add more complex pattern matching (regex support, multiple conditions)\n- Implement rule priorities and conflict resolution\n- Add rule validation and error handling\n\n### Expand Notification System\n- Add email notifications for organization events\n- Integrate with monitoring systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie)\n- Add detailed reporting on email organization statistics\n\n### Advanced Email Processing\n- Add support for email content analysis and categorization\n- Implement sentiment analysis for email prioritization\n- Add support for attachment handling and organization\n\n### Security and Privacy Enhancements\n- Implement email content encryption for sensitive information\n- Add audit logging for email organization actions\n- Set up access controls for rule management\n\n### Performance Optimizations\n- Add batch processing for high-volume email accounts\n- Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed rules\n- Add email processing metrics and performance monitoring\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Google Sheets Integration** -
