  "description": "## How It Works\nThis workflow transforms n8n into a smart Web Lead Form alternative to Salesforce's traditional Web-to-Lead, capturing leads, creating Salesforce records, and sending AI-personalized responses via email or SMS.\n\n- **Capture Submission**: User submits form data (name, email, phone, description, preference) via n8n's hosted form.\n- **Create Lead**: Maps data to a new Salesforce Lead.\n- **Personalize Message**: Uses OpenAI to generate a tailored welcome based on description and preference (detailed for email, concise for SMS).\n- **Route Outreach**: Branches to send via Twilio SMS or SMTP email depending on preference.\n\n## Set Up Steps\nSetup takes about 15-30 minutes if you have credentials ready. Focus on connecting services; detailed configs are in workflow sticky notes.\n\n- Duplicate this template in n8n.\n- Add your Salesforce, OpenAI, Twilio, and SMTP credentials (no hardcoding—use n8n's credential manager).\n- Customize form fields if needed and test with sample data.\n- Activate and share the form URL on your site.\n\n[n8n Web to Lead Form.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1puZgYLD2aKcuyhyTF_C-s_1kCWBwNnLQ/view?usp=sharing)",
