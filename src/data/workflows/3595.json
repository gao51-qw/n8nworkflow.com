This template streamlines error detection by:\n\n- Capturing workflow failures using the **Error Trigger** node\n- Diagnosing root causes with the help of **OpenAI**\n- Sending a fully-formatted, human-readable **HTML error report** via email\n- Including practical resolutions and next-step suggestions\n\nThis helps you or your team resolve issues faster and avoid repeated manual debugging.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\n- ⚡ **Triggers on any n8n workflow error**\n- 📦 **Extracts relevant error metadata** including node, execution ID, and timestamps\n- 🧠 **Sends error content to OpenAI** for analysis and recommendations\n- 💌 **Generates an HTML email report** with inline styles and clear formatting\n- 📥 **Emails the result to a system administrator or support email**\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup\n\n1. **Install the OpenAI node** in your self-hosted n8n instance.\n2. Add your **OpenAI API Key** securely in credentials.\n3. Configure the **SMTP Email node** with your email credentials.\n4. Adjust the **Error Trigger** to monitor specific workflows or all workflows.\n5.
