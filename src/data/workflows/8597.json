Import this workflow into your n8n instance.  \n2. Connect your Google Sheets, Gmail, and Google Calendar credentials.  \n3. Add your knowledge base into Google Sheets (questions, answers, policies, packs, etc.).  \n4. Test the workflow using the **Connected Chat Trigger** node to start conversations with the AI Agent.  \n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs  \n- Update the Google Sheets database with your own training packs, services, or company FAQs.  \n- Adjust the email template to reflect your branding and communication style.  \n- Modify the appointment duration if you need sessions longer or shorter than 1 hour.  \n- Add extra nodes (e.g., CRM integration) to capture leads or sync appointments with external systems.  \n---\n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/Build-Your-First-AI-Agent-with-ChatGPT-5-By-Dr-Firas-26f3d6550fd9801eb00dc0c578fc5f2c?source=copy_link)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
