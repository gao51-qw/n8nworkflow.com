When you reach out to some small blogs it is common for the owner to have an address like DomainName@gmail.com.\n\nThis workflow will find such emails for you. \n\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\nGet from a list of domain names to a list of email addresses. This is perfect to prepare a cold outreach campaign for link building.\n\nThis workflow allows you to find email addresses with any extension. I recommend searching for Gmail as a starting Point. But you can also use workflow to check for other email providers.\n\n**Pro-tip:** Check the email provider used in the geography you target:\n- Lapost.net for France\n- Seznam.cz for Czechia\n\n## What this workflow does\nThis workflow will:\n- Generate email candidates based on the domain name and root you are providing\n- Check if those email addresses are valid using EmailListVerify\n\n##Requirement\nThis template uses:\n- Google Sheet to handle input and output data\n- EmailListVerify to discover email (from $0.05 per email)\n\n## Setup (10 minutes)\n**1:** Make a copy of the [GoogleSheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r4DZ4GnqKzivmIhRdv1D35fvS_Mg-VTKgbuZS-7H-HY/edit?usp=sharing)\n**2:** In \"[Input] pattern\" sheet write the email extension you want to check.
