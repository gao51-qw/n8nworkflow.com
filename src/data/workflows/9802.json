  "description": "🤖 AI-Powered Hardware Store Assistant with PostgreSQL & MCP\nSupercharge your customer service with this conversational AI agent! This n8n workflow provides a complete solution for a hardware store chatbot that connects to a PostgreSQL database in real-time. It uses Google Gemini for natural language understanding and the powerful MCP (My Credential Provider) nodes to securely expose database operations as tools for the AI agent.\n✨ Key Features\n💬 Conversational Product Queries: Allow users to ask for products by name, category, description, or even technical notes.\n📦 Real-time Inventory & Pricing: The agent fetches live data directly from your PostgreSQL database, ensuring accurate stock and price information.\n💰 Automatic Quote Generation: Ask the agent to create a detailed quote for a list of materials, and it will calculate quantities and totals.\n🧠 Smart Project Advice: The agent is primed with a system message to act as an expert, helping users calculate materials for projects (e.g., \"How much drywall do I need for a 10x12 foot room?\").\n🛠️ Tech Stack & Core Components\nTechnologies Used\n🗄️ PostgreSQL: For storing and managing product data.\n✨ Google Gemini API: The large language model that powers the agent's conversational abilities.\n🔗 MCP (My Credential Provider): Securely exposes database queries as callable tools without exposing credentials directly to the agent.\nn8n Nodes Used\n@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent: The core AI agent that orchestrates the workflow.\n@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger: To start a conversation.\n@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini: The connection to the Google Gemini model.\nn8n-nodes-base.postgresTool: Individual nodes for querying products by ID, name, category, etc.\n@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpTrigger: Exposes the PostgresTools.\n@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpClientTool: Allows the AI agent to consume the tools exposed by the MCP Trigger.\n🚀 How to Get Started: Setup & Configuration\nFollow these steps to get your AI assistant up and running:\nConfigure your Database:\nThis template assumes a PostgreSQL database named bd_ferreteria with a productos table.
