Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)\n2. Click \"Create App\" or \"Create Another App\"\n3. Choose \"web app\" as the app type\n4. Fill in the required fields:\n   - **Name**: Your app name\n   - **Description**: Brief description of your app\n   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` (or your n8n instance URL + `/oauth/callback`)\n5.

Analysis\n1. **Modify the Structured Data Generator prompt**: Edit the prompt in the \"Structured Data Generator\" node to adjust the analysis criteria or output format\n2. **Change the AI model**: In the \"OpenRouter Chat Model1\" node, you can switch to different models like `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` or `openai/gpt-4` based on your preferences and budget\n3. **Adjust post limits**: Modify the `limit` parameter in the \"Get many posts\" and \"Get many comments in a post\" nodes to control how much data you process\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\n### Making API Calls\n\nSend a POST request to your webhook URL with the following parameters:\n\n**Required Parameters:**\n- `subreddit`: The subreddit name (without r/)\n- `limit`: Number of posts to analyze (recommended: 5-15)\n\n**Optional Parameters:**\n- `query`: Search term to filter posts (optional)\n\n**Example Request:**\n```bash\ncurl -X POST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/reddit-sentiment \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"subreddit\": \"CustomerService\",\n    \"limit\": 10\n  }'\n```\n\n### Understanding the Output\n\nThe workflow returns a JSON array with detailed analysis for each post:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"sentiment_analysis\": {\n      \"overall_sentiment\": {\n        \"category\": \"Negative\",\n        \"confidence_score\": 8\n      },\n      \"emotional_tone\":

Workflow Nodes Explanation\n\n### Data Collection Nodes\n- **Webhook**: Receives API requests with subreddit and analysis parameters\n- **Get many posts**: Fetches recent posts from the specified subreddit\n- **Split Out**: Processes individual posts for analysis\n- **Get many comments in a post**: Retrieves comments for each post\n\n### Processing Nodes\n- **Loop Over Items**: Manages batch processing of multiple posts\n- **Sentiment Analyzer**: Primary AI analysis node that processes content\n- **Structured Data Generator**: Formats AI output into structured JSON\n- **Code**: Parses and cleans the AI response\n- **Respond to Webhook**: Returns the final analysis results\n\n## Customization Options\n\n### Adjusting Analysis Depth\n- Modify the `limit` parameters to analyze more or fewer posts/comments\n- Update the AI prompts to focus on specific aspects (e.g., product mentions, competitor analysis)\n\n### Adding Data Storage\n- Connect database nodes to store analysis results for historical tracking\n- Add email notifications for high-priority findings\n\n### Integrating with Other Tools\n- Connect to Slack/Discord for real-time alerts\n- Link to Google Sheets for easy
