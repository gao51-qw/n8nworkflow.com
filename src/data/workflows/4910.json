  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.* \n\nUncover new business leads with this AI-Powered Prospect Discovery Agent! This n8n workflow acts as a specialized intelligent assistant that, given a business type and location, uses multiple search strategies to identify a list of potential prospect companies and their websites.\n\nStop manually trawling through search results! This agent automates the initial phase of lead generation by:\n*   Understanding your target business profile (type, location, keywords).\n*   Strategically using web search tools (Brave Search, Google Gemini Search) to find relevant businesses.\n*   Performing quick validations to confirm relevance.\n*   Returning a clean, structured JSON list of prospect names and their website URLs.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe workflow is built around an AI agent powered by Google Gemini. This agent is equipped with tools like:\n\n*   **Brave Web Search:** For broad initial sourcing of potential business candidates.\n*   **Google Gemini Search:** For advanced, context-aware discovery and finding businesses mentioned in various online sources.\n*   **Brave Local Search (Selective):** For quick verification of local presence or finding website URLs for identified names.\n*   **Jina AI Web Page Scraper (Very Selective):** For extremely rapid relevance checks on uncertain websites by scanning page content for keywords.\n\nThe agent's system prompt guides it to use these tools efficiently to build a list of prospects without getting bogged down in deep research on any single one at this discovery stage.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n*   **Lead Generation:** Automatically generate lists of potential clients based on industry and location.\n*   **Market Research:** Identify key players or types of businesses in a specific geographical area.\n*   **Sales Development:** Provide SDRs with initial lists of companies to research further.\n*   **Called as a Sub-Workflow:** Designed to be easily integrated as a \"tool\" into more complex orchestrating AI agents (e.g., a BNI Pitch Planner that first needs to identify who to target).\n\n**Setup:**\n\n1.  **Import the workflow.**\n2.  **Configure Credentials:** You'll need n8n credentials for:\n    *   Google Gemini (for the Chat model and the Gemini Search/Vertex AI Search tool).\n    *   Brave Search (e.g., via Smithery MCP, or adapt if you have direct API access).\n    *   Jina AI (for the web scraper).\n    Assign these to the respective nodes.\n3.  **Review System Prompt:** The `prospect_discovery_agent` node contains a detailed system prompt. You can fine-tune this to adjust its search strategies or the strictness of its matching.\n4.  **Inputs:** This workflow is triggered by an \"Execute Workflow Trigger\" node (`prospect_discovery_workflow`). It expects the following inputs:\n    *   `business_type` (string): e.g., \"artisan bakery\"\n    *   `location_query` (string): e.g., \"Portland, Oregon\"\n    *   `desired_num_prospects` (number): e.g., 5\n    *   `additional_keywords` (string, optional): e.g., \"organic, gluten-free\"\n\n**To Use (as a Sub-Workflow/Tool):**\n\nThis workflow is typically called by another n8n workflow (e.g., using a \"Tool Workflow\" node from the Langchain nodes). The calling workflow would provide the inputs listed above. The \"Prospect Discovery\" workflow will then execute and its final node (the `prospect_discovery_agent`) will output a JSON array of found prospects, like:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"business_name\": \"Rose Petal Bakery\",\n    \"website_url\": \"https://rosepetalbakerypdx.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"business_name\": \"The Daily Bread Artisans\",\n    \"website_url\": \"https://dailybreadpdx.com\"\n  }\n]\n```\nIf no prospects are found, it returns an empty array `[]`.\n\nThis template provides a powerful and focused tool for automating the initial stages of prospect identification.",
