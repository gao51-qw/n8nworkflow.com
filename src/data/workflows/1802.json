  "description": "## 🎲 Random Data Generator 🎲\n\nThis beginner-friendly workflow allows you to generate random mock data effortlessly, without any programming or external dependencies. 🚀\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. 📝 Provide some default values for the random generator using the \"Code\" node. Don't worry, no coding is needed, it's just a simple JSON! You can even use the \"Ask AI\" in the cloud version of n8n to generate mock values for you. These values are permanently stored in the workflow ensuring swift and reliable execution.\n\n2. 🔀 The \"Firstname,\" \"Lastname,\" and \"Occupation\" nodes extract invividual variables. Two Merge nodes create a combination of all possible values. Adapt this section based on your needs.\n\n3. 🎲 The \"Random\" node shuffles the generated data.\n\n4. 🔢 Use the \"Limit\" node to control the number of output items.\n\n5. ✨ Perform additional post-processing, such as deriving email addresses based on the user's name and surname.\n\nAnd there you have it! With just a few clicks, you'll have a set of realistic mock data ready to test your workflows. 🎉\n\nWant to learn more?
