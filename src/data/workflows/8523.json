  "description": "This n8n template shows you how to turn outbound sales into a fully automated machine: scrape verified leads, research them with AI, and fire off personalized cold emails while you sleep.\n\nUse cases are simple: scale B2B lead gen without hiring more SDRs, run targeted outreach campaigns that don’t feel generic, and give founders or agencies a repeatable system that books more calls with less effort.\n\n**Good to know**\n- At time of writing, each AI call may incur costs depending on your OpenAI plan.\n- This workflow uses Apollo/Apify for lead scraping, which requires an active token.\n- Telegram approval flow is optional but recommended for quality control.\n\n**How it works**\n- Define your ICP (role, location, industry) in the workflow.\n- Generate Apollo search URLs and scrape verified contacts.\n- AI enriches leads with personal + company research.\n- Hormozi-style cold emails are generated and queued for approval.\n- Approve drafts in Telegram, then Gmail automatically sends them out.\n\n**How to use**\n- Start with the included Schedule Trigger or replace with a Webhook/Form trigger.\n- Adjust ICP settings in the Set node to fit your target audience.\n- Test with a small batch of leads before scaling to larger runs.\n\n**Requirements**\n- Google Sheets, Docs, Drive, and Gmail connected to n8n\n- Apollo/Apify account and token\n- OpenAI API key\n- Telegram bot for approvals\n\n**Customising this workflow**\n- Swap Apollo scraping with another data source if needed.\n- Adapt the AI prompt for a different email tone (formal, friendly, etc.).\n- Extend with a CRM integration to sync approved leads and outreach results.",
