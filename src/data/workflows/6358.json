  "description": "## Programatically Pull Square Report Data Into N8N\n\n## What It Does\nThis sub-workflow connects to the Square API and generates a daily sales summary report for all of your Square locations. The report matches the figures displayed in the Square Dashboard &gt; Reports &gt; Sales Summary.\n\nIt’s designed to be reused in other workflows, ideal for reporting, data storage, accounting, or automation.\n\n## Prerequisites\nTo use this workflow, you'll need:\n- Square API credentials (configured as a Header Auth credential)\n\n## How to Set Up Square Credentials:\n- Go to Credentials &gt; Create New\n- Choose Header Auth\n- Set the Name to \"Authorization\"\n- Set the Value to your Square Access Token (e.g., Bearer &lt;your-api-key&gt;)\n\n## How It Works\n1. Trigger: The workflow is triggered as a sub-workflow, requiring a report_date input.\n2. Fetch Locations: An HTTP request gets all Square locations linked to your account.\n3. Fetch Orders: For each location, an HTTP request pulls completed orders for the specified report_date.\n4. Filter Empty Locations: Locations with no sales are ignored.\n5. Aggregate Sales Data: A Code node processes the order data and produces a summary identical to Square’s built-in Sales Summary report.\n6. Output: A cleaned, consistent summary that can be consumed by parent workflows or other nodes.\n\n## Example Use Cases\n- Automatically store daily sales data in Google Sheets, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for analysis and historical tracking\n- Automatically send daily email or Slack reports to managers or finance teams\n- Build weekly/monthly reports by looping over multiple dates\n- Push sales data into accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero for automated bookkeeping\n- Calculate commissions or rent payments based on sales volume\n\n## How to Use\n- Configure both HTTP Request nodes to use your Square API credential.\n- If you are not in the Toronto/New York Timezone, please change the \"start_at\" and \"end_at\" parameters in the second HTTP node from \"-05:00\" to your local timezone\n- Use as a sub-workflow inside a main workflow.\n- Pass a report_date (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD) to the sub-workflow when you call it.\n\n## Customization Options\n- Add pagination to handle locations with more than 1,000 orders per day.\n- Expand the workflow to save or send the report output via additional integrations (email, database, webhook, etc.).\n\n## Why It's Useful\nThis workflow saves time, reduces manual report pulling from Square, and enables smarter automation around sales data—whether for operations, finance, or performance monitoring.\n\n",
