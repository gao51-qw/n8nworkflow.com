Alternatively, switch this out for o1 series.\n* You must publish this workflow and ensure the form url is publically accessible.\n\n## On depth & breadth configuration\nFor more detailed reports, increase depth and breadth but be warned the workflow will take exponentially longer and cost more to complete. The recommended defaults are usually good enough.\n\nDepth=1 & Breadth=2 - will take about 5 - 10mins.\nDepth=1 & Breadth=3 - will take about 15 - 20mins.\nDpeth=3 & Breadth=5 - will take about 2+ hours!\n\n## Customising this workflow\n* I deliberately chose not to use AI-powered scrapers like Firecrawl as I felt these were quite costly and quotas would be quickly exhausted. However, feel free to switch web search and scraping services which suit your environment.\n* Maybe you don't decide to source the web and instead, data collection comes from internal documents instead. This template gives you freedom to change this.\n* Experiment with different Reasoning/Thinking models such as Deepseek and Google's Gemini 2.0.\n* Finally, the LLM prompts could definitely be improved. Refine them to fit your use-case.\n\n### Credits\n* This template is largely based off the work by David Zhang (dzhng) and his open source implementation of Deep Research: [https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research)",
