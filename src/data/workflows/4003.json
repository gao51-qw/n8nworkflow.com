The workflow uses AI to perform deep analysis of image ads and organize the results in a structured format.\n\n**How it works**\n* The workflow connects to Facebook's Ad Library to scrape image ads based on a specified page ID.\n* Images are filtered by reach and days running, then processed through OpenAI's GPT-4o to analyze their content.\n* Each image ad is systematically analyzed to extract key components: visual description, hook elements, main offer, call-to-action, and psychological triggers.\n* Results are processed through an AI agent that structures the data into standardized fields.\n* Original images are saved to Google Drive for reference.\n* All analysis and metadata are saved to a Google Sheet for easy access and further processing.\n\n**How to use** \nOnce you've set up your credentials and configured the output:\n* Enter the Meta Ad Library URL you want to analyze in the Settings node.\n* Adjust the maximum number of ads to scrape and analyze based on your needs (defaults: 300 to scrape, 10 to analyze).\n* Configure the Google Drive folder to save the original ad images.\n* Ensure your Google Sheets connection is set up to receive the structured analysis.\n* Click \"Test Workflow\" to start the analysis process.\n\n**Requirements**\n* Apify account (for Meta Ad Library scraping)\n* OpenAI API key (for image analysis)\n* Google Drive and Google Sheets access\n\n**Customizing this workflow**\n* Modify the AI prompts in the \"Analyze Image Contents\" node to extract different information from the images.\n* Adjust the output formats in the Structured Output Parser node.\n* Change the Google Sheets mapping to match your desired output structure.\n* Increase the number of ads analyzed for more comprehensive research.\n* Filter ads based on different criteria by modifying the \"Filter only Image Ads\" node.",
