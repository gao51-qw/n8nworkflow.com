  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\n* Support teams and customer service departments managing Jira tickets\n* Team leads and managers who need daily visibility into ticket resolution progress\n* Organizations wanting to automate ticket reporting and communication\n* IT departments seeking to streamline support ticket summarization and tracking\n\n## **What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\nManual ticket review and reporting is time-consuming and often lacks comprehensive analysis. This workflow solves those issues by:\n\n* **Automating daily ticket analysis** by fetching, analyzing, and summarizing all tickets created each day\n* **Providing intelligent summaries** using AI to extract key insights from ticket descriptions, comments, and resolutions\n* **Streamlining communication** by automatically sending formatted daily reports to stakeholders\n* **Saving time** by eliminating manual ticket review and report generation\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow automatically fetches daily Jira tickets, analyzes them with AI, and sends comprehensive summaries via email to keep your team informed about support activities.\n\n**Step by step:**\n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs the workflow automatically at your chosen interval (or manual trigger for testing)\n2. **Set Project Key** defines the Jira project to monitor (default: SUP project)\n3. **Get All Tickets** from the specified project created today\n4. **Split Out** extracts individual ticket data including key, summary, and description\n5. **Loop Tickets** processes each ticket individually through batch processing\n6. **Get Comments from Ticket** retrieves all comments and conversations for complete context\n7. **Merge** combines ticket data with associated comments for comprehensive analysis\n8. **Ticket Summarizer (AI Agent)** uses OpenAI GPT-5 to generate professional summaries and proposed solutions\n9. **Set Output** structures the AI analysis into standardized JSON format\n10. **Aggregate** collects all processed ticket summaries into a single dataset\n11. **Format Body** creates a readable email format with direct Jira ticket links\n12. **Send Ticket Summaries** delivers the daily report via Gmail\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Connect your Jira account** by adding your Jira Software Cloud API credentials to the Jira nodes\n2. **Add your OpenAI API key** to the OpenAI Chat Model node for AI-powered ticket analysis\n3. **Configure Gmail credentials** for the Send Ticket Summaries node to deliver reports\n4. **Update the recipient email** in the \"Send Ticket Summaries\" node to your desired recipient\n5. **Adjust the project key** in the \"Set Project Key\" node to match your Jira project identifier\n6. **Configure the schedule trigger** to run daily at your preferred time for automatic reporting\n7. **Customize the JQL query** in Jira nodes to filter tickets based on your specific requirements\n8. **Test the workflow** using the manual trigger to ensure proper ticket fetching and AI analysis\n9. **Review email formatting** in the \"Format Body\" node and adjust as needed for your reporting style\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n* **Modify AI prompts**: customize the ticket analysis prompt in the \"Ticket Summarizer\" node to focus on specific aspects like priority, resolution time, or customer impact\n* **Adjust ticket filters**: change the JQL queries to filter by status, priority, assignee, or custom date ranges beyond \"today\"\n* **Add more data points**: include additional ticket fields like priority, status, assignee, or custom fields in the analysis\n* **Customize email format**: modify the \"Format Body\" node to change the report structure, add charts, or include additional formatting\n* **Set up different schedules**: create multiple versions for different reporting frequencies (hourly, weekly, monthly)\n\n## Need help customizing?\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**  ",
