  "description": "# How it Works\n\nThis workflow automates customer support for SMEs in five simple steps:\n\n1. **Capture requests** via a Webhook connected to a contact form.\n2. **Extract the message** to make processing easier.\n3. **Check categories** (e.g., refund-related requests) using an IF node.\n4. **Save all tickets** to a Google Sheet for tracking.\n5. **Send an acknowledgment email** back to the customer automatically.\n\nThis setup ensures all customer inquiries are logged, categorized, and acknowledged without manual effort.\n\n---\n\n# Setup Steps\n\n1. **Webhook**\n\n   * Add a Webhook node with the path `customer-support`.\n   * Configure your contact form or system to send `name`, `email`, and `message` to this webhook.\n\n2. **Extract Message (Set Node)**\n\n   * Add a Set node.\n   * Map the incoming `message` field to make it available for other nodes.\n\n3. **Check Category (IF Node)**\n\n   * Insert an IF node.\n   * Example: check if the `message` contains the word “refund”.\n   * This allows you to route refund-related requests differently if needed.\n\n4. **Save Ticket (Google Sheets)**\n\n   * Connect to Google Sheets with OAuth2 credentials.\n   * Operation: `Append`.\n   * Range: `Tickets!A:C`.\n   * Map the fields `Name`, `Email`, and `Message`.\n\n5. **Send Acknowledgement (Email Send)**\n\n   * Configure the Email Send node with your SMTP credentials.\n   * `To`: `={{$json.email}}`.\n   * Subject: `Support Ticket Received`.\n   * Body: personalize with `{{$json.name}}` and include the `{{$json.message}}`.\n\n---\n\n👉 With this workflow, SMEs can handle incoming support tickets more efficiently, maintain a simple ticket log, and improve customer satisfaction through instant acknowledgment.",
