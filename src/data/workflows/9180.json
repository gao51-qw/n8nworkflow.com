  "description": "## 🧩 Summary  \nEasily digitize and organize your business cards!  \nThis workflow allows you to **upload a business card image**, automatically **extract contact information using Google Gemini’s OCR & vision model**, and **save the structured data into a Notion database** — no manual typing required.  \n\nPerfect for teams or individuals who want to centralize client contact info in Notion after networking events or meetings.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works  \n\n1. **Form Submission**  \n   - Upload a business card image (`.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg`) through an n8n form.  \n   - Optionally select a category (e.g., Partner, Client, Vendor).  \n\n2. **AI-Powered OCR (Google Gemini)**  \n   - The uploaded image is sent to **Google Gemini Vision** for intelligent text recognition and entity extraction.  \n   - Gemini returns structured text data such as:  \n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Name\": \"Jung Hyun Park\",\n       \"Position\": \"Head of Development\",\n       \"Phone\": \"021231234\",\n       \"Mobile\": \"0101231234\",\n       \"Email\": \"abc@dc.com\",\n       \"Company\": \"TOV\",\n       \"Address\": \"6F, Donga Building, 212, Yeoksam-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul\",\n       \"Website\": \"www.tov.com\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **JSON Parsing & Cleanup**  \n   - The text response from Gemini is cleaned and parsed into a valid JSON object using a Code node.\n\n4. **Save to Notion**  \n   - The parsed data is automatically inserted into your Notion database (`Customer Business Cards`).  \n   - Fields such as Name, Email, Phone, Address, and Company are mapped to Notion properties.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Used Nodes  \n- **Form Trigger** – Captures uploaded business card and category input  \n- **Google Gemini (Vision)** – Extracts contact details from the image  \n- **Code** – Parses Gemini’s output into structured JSON  \n- **Notion** – Saves extracted contact info to your Notion database  \n\n---\n\n## 📦 Integrations  \n| Service | Purpose | Node Type |\n|----------|----------|-----------|\n| **Google Gemini (PaLM)** | Image-to-text extraction (OCR + structured entity parsing) | `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.googleGemini` |\n| **Notion** | Contact data storage | `n8n-nodes-base.notion` |\n\n---\n\n## 🧰 Requirements  \n- A connected **Google Gemini (PaLM)** API credential  \n- A **Notion integration** with edit access to your database  \n---\n\n## 🚀 Example Use Cases  \n- Digitize stacks of collected business cards after a conference  \n- Auto-save new partner contacts to your CRM database in Notion  \n- Build a searchable Notion-based contact directory  \n- Combine with Notion filters or rollups to manage client relationships  \n\n---\n\n## 💡 Tips  \n- You can easily extend this workflow by adding an **email notification node** to confirm successful uploads.  \n- For multilingual cards, Gemini Vision handles mixed-language text recognition well.  \n- Adjust Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-1.5-pro`) based on your accuracy vs. speed needs.  \n\n---\n\n## 🧾 Template Metadata  \n| Field | Value |\n|-------|--------|\n| **Category** | AI + Notion + OCR |\n| **Difficulty** | Beginner–Intermediate |\n| **Trigger Type** | Form Submission |\n| **Use Case** | Automate business card digitization |\n| **Works with** | Google Gemini, Notion |",
