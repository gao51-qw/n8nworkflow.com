  "description": "This n8n template leverages n8n's multi-form feature to build a 2 part job application submission journey which aims to eliminate the need for applicants to re-enter data found on their CVs/Resumes.\n\n## How it works\n* The application submission process starts with an n8n form trigger to accept CV files in the form of PDFs.\n* The PDF is validated using the text classifier node to determine if it is a valid CV else the applicant is asked to reupload.\n* A basic LLM node is used to extract relevant information from the CV as data capture. A copy of the original job post is included to ensure relevancy.\n* Applicant's data is then sent to an ATS for processing. For our demo, we used airtable because we could attach PDFs to rows.\n* Finally, a second form trigger is used for the actual application form. However, it is prefilled to save the applicant's time and allow them to amend any of the generated application fields.\n\n## How to use\n* Ensure to change the redirect URL in the **form ending** node to use the host domain of your n8n instance.\n\n## Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* Airtable to capture applicant data\n\n## Customising the workflow\n* Application form is pretty basic for this demonstration but could be extended to ask more in-depth questions.\n* If it fits the job, why not ask applicants to upload portfolio works and have AI describe/caption them.",
