  "description": "# Generate SEO content outlines from SERP analysis to Google Docs\n\n\n## Overview\nStop wasting hours on manual competitor research and content briefing. This workflow automates the creation of data-backed content briefs by analyzing the current top-ranking pages for your specific keyword.\n\n\nIt scrapes the Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP), extracts the content structure (headings H1-H3) from competitor articles, and uses AI to generate a comprehensive article outline based on what is already ranking. The final outline is automatically saved to a Google Doc, streamlining your content production process.\n\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Content Marketers:** To drastically reduce the time needed to create detailed content briefs.\n- **SEO Specialists:** To analyze competitor content structures at scale without manual checking.\n- **Bloggers & Writers:** To overcome writer's block and ensure their content covers all necessary topics to rank.\n\n\n## How it works\n1.  **Input:** You enter a \"Target Keyword\" and \"Target Audience\" via the built-in n8n Form.\n2.  **SERP Scraping:** The workflow uses **Apify** (Google Search Scraper) to fetch the top results for that keyword.\n3.  **Filtering:** It automatically removes non-article URLs (such as Amazon product pages, YouTube videos, and PDFs) to ensure only relevant content competitors are analyzed.\n4.  **Deep Extraction:** It visits each competitor's URL using **Apify** (Cheerio Scraper) to extract their article metadata and heading structure (H1, H2, H3).\n5.  **AI Analysis:** The aggregated data is sent to **OpenAI**, which analyzes common patterns and generates an optimized article outline.\n6.  **Output:**\n    - A new **Google Doc** is created with the generated outline.\n    - The request details are logged in **Google Sheets** for your records.\n\n\n## Requirements\n- **Apify Account:** You will need an Apify account with access to the *Google Search Result Scraper* and *Cheerio Scraper* actors.\n- **OpenAI Account:** An API key for OpenAI (GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 recommended).\n- **Google Cloud:** Credentials to access Google Docs and Google Sheets.\n\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Configure Credential:** Connect your Apify, OpenAI, and Google accounts in the respective nodes.\n2.  **Workflow Configuration:** Open the `Workflow Configuration` node. You can change the `countryCode` (default is \"jp\" for Japan) to your target region (e.g., \"us\", \"uk\") and adjust `maxResults` if needed.\n3.  **Google Sheets Setup:** Create a Google Sheet with a column header named `target_keyword`. Copy the Spreadsheet ID and paste it into the `Store Form Responses` node.\n4.  **Run:** Click \"Chat\" or \"Open Form\" in the trigger node to start the workflow.\n\n\n## How to customize\n- **Change the AI Model:** In the `AI Content Structure Analysis` node, you can switch between different OpenAI models or adjust the system prompt to change the tone/format of the outline.\n- **Adjust Filters:** Modify the `Filter Non-Article URLs` node to exclude specific domains you don't want to analyze (e.g., wikipedia.org).\n- **Output Format:** You can modify the `Create Google Doc` node to include more specific data, such as the list of competitor URLs analyzed.![スクリーンショット 20251215 114351.png](fileId:3657)",
