  "description": "# WhatsApp Bulk Number Verification in Google Sheets Using Unofficial Rapiwa API\n\n## Who’s it for\nThis workflow is for marketers, small business owners, freelancers, and support teams who want to automate WhatsApp messaging using a Google Sheet without the official WhatsApp Business API. It’s suitable when you need a budget-friendly, easy-to-maintain solution that uses your personal or business WhatsApp number via an unofficial API service such as Rapiwa.\n\n## How it works / What it does\n- The workflow looks for rows in a Google Sheet where the `Status` column is `pending`.\n- It cleans each phone number (removes non-digits).\n- It verifies the number with the Rapiwa verify endpoint (`/api/verify-whatsapp`).\n- If the number is verified:\n  - The workflow can send a message (optional).\n  - It updates the sheet: `Verification = verified`, `Status = sent` (or leaves `Status` for the send node to update).\n- If the number is not verified:\n  - It skips sending.\n  - It updates the sheet: `Verification = unverified`, `Status = not sent`.\n- The workflow processes rows in batches and inserts short delays between items to avoid rate limits.\n- The whole process runs on a schedule (configurable).\n\n## Key features\n- Scheduled automatic checks (configurable interval; recommended 5–10 minutes).  \n- Cleans phone numbers to a proper format before verification.  \n- Verifies WhatsApp registration using Rapiwa.  \n- Batch processing with limits to control workload (recommended max per run configurable).  \n- Short delay between items to reduce throttling and temporary blocks.  \n- Automatic sheet updates for auditability (verified/unverified, sent/not sent).  \n\n## Defaults recommended in this workflow\n- Trigger interval: every 5–10 minutes (adjustable).  \n- Max items per run: configurable (example: 200 max per cycle).  \n- Delay between items: 2–5 seconds (example uses 3 seconds).  \n\n## How to set up\n1. Duplicate the sample Google Sheet: ➤ [Sample](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ui4TzzI-Gq-bsEsrZELwW1Kyddw0IU9L1wxlHikktqw/edit?usp=sharing)  \n2. Fill contact rows and set `Status = pending`. Include columns like `WhatsApp No`, `Name`, `Message`, `Verification`, `Status`.  \n3. In n8n, add and authenticate a Google Sheets node pointed to your sheet.  \n4. Create an HTTP Bearer credential in n8n and paste your Rapiwa API key.  \n5. Configure the workflow nodes (Trigger → Google Sheets → Limit/SplitInBatches → Code (clean) → HTTP Request (verify) → If → Update Sheet → Wait).  \n6. Enable the workflow and monitor first runs with a small test batch.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n instance with Google Sheets and HTTP Request nodes enabled.  \n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n.  \n- Rapiwa account and Bearer token (stored in n8n credentials).  \n- Google Sheet formatted to match the workflow columns.\n\n## Why use Rapiwa\n- Cost-effective and developer-friendly REST API for WhatsApp verification and sending.  \n- Simple integration via HTTP requests and n8n.  \n- Useful when you prefer not to use the official WhatsApp Business API.  \nNote: Rapiwa is an unofficial service — review its terms and risks before production use.\n\n## How to customize\n- Change schedule frequency in the Trigger node.  \n- Adjust maxItems in Limit/SplitInBatches for throughput control.  \n- Change the Wait node delay for safer sending.  \n- Modify the HTTP Request body to support media or templates if the provider supports it.  \n- Add logging or a separate audit sheet to record API responses and errors.\n\n## Best practices\n- Test with a small batch first.  \n- Keep the sheet headers exact and consistent.  \n- Store API keys in n8n credentials (do not hardcode).  \n- Increase Wait time or reduce batch size if you see rate limits.  \n- Keep a log sheet of verified/unverified rows for troubleshooting.\n\n## Example HTTP verify body (n8n HTTP Request node)\n```json\n{\n  \"number\": \"{{ $json['WhatsApp No'] }}\"\n}\n```\n\n## Notes and best practices\n- Test with a small batch before scaling.\n- Store the Rapiwa token in n8n credentials, not in node fields.\n- Increase Wait delay or reduce batch size if you see rate limits or temporary blocks.\n- Keep the sheet headers consistent; the workflow matches columns by name.\n- Log API responses or errors for troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## Optional\n- Add a send-message HTTP Request node after verification to send messages.  \n- Append successful and failed rows to separate sheets for easy review.\n\n## Support & Community\n\nNeed help setting up or customizing the workflow?
