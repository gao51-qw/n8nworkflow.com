  "description": "## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nSending a plain PDF resume doesn’t stand out anymore. This workflow allows candidates to **convert their resume and photo into a personalized video resume**.\nRecruiters get a more engaging first impression, while candidates showcase their profile in a modern, impactful way.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?\n\n1. Presents a form for uploading:\n   - 📄 Resume (PDF)\n   - 🖼 Photo (headshot)\n2. Extracts key details from the resume (education, experience, skills).\n3. Detects gender from the photo to choose a suitable voice/avatar.\n4. Generates a **script** (spoken resume summary) based on the extracted information.\n5. Uploads the photo to **HeyGen** to create an avatar.\n6. Requests **video generation** on HeyGen:\n   - Uses the avatar photo\n   - Uses gender-specific settings\n   - Uses the generated script as narration\n7. Monitors video generation status until completion.\n8. Stores the final **video URL** in a Google Sheet for easy access and tracking.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup Instructions\n\n### Google Services\n- Connect **Google Sheets** to n8n to store records with:\n  - Candidate name\n  - Resume link\n  - Video link\n\n### HeyGen Setup\n- Get an API key from [HeyGen](https://www.heygen.com).\n- Configure:\n  - **Avatar upload endpoint** (image upload)\n  - **Video generation endpoint** (image ID + script)\n\n### Form Setup\n- Use the **n8n Form Trigger** to allow candidates to upload:\n  - Resume (PDF)\n  - Photo (JPEG/PNG)\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it Works – Step-by-Step\n\n### 1. Candidate Submission\nA candidate fills out a form and uploads:\n- Resume (PDF)\n- Photo\n\n### 2. Extract Resume Data\n- The resume PDF is processed using OCR/AI to extract:\n  - Name\n  - Experience\n  - Skills\n  - Education highlights\n\n### 3. Gender Detection\n- The uploaded photo is analyzed to detect gender (used for voice/avatar selection).\n\n### 4. Script Generation\n- Based on the extracted resume info, a concise, natural **script** is generated automatically.\n\n### 5. Avatar Upload & Video Creation\n- The photo is uploaded to **HeyGen** to create a custom avatar.\n- A video generation request is made using:\n  - The script\n  - The avatar (image ID)\n  - A matching voice for the detected gender\n\n### 6. Video Status Monitoring\n- The workflow polls HeyGen’s API until the video is ready.\n\n### 7. Save Final Video URL\n- Once complete, the **video link** is added to a Google Sheet alongside the candidate’s details.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who can use this?\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n- 🧑‍🎓 **Students and job seekers** looking to stand out\n- 🧑‍💼 **Recruitment agencies** offering modern resume services\n- 🏢 **HR teams** wanting engaging candidate submissions\n- 🎥 **Portfolio builders** for professionals\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Impact\n\nInstead of a static PDF, you can now send a **dynamic video resume** that captures attention, adds personality, and makes a lasting impression.\n\n",
