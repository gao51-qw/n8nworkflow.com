  "description": "## Advanced Code Review Automation (AI + Lint + Slack)\n\n### Who’s it for\nFor software engineers, QA teams, and tech leads who want to **automate intelligent code reviews** with both AI-driven suggestions and rule-based linting — all managed in Google Sheets with instant Slack summaries.\n\n### How it works\nThis workflow performs a two-layer review system:\n1. **Lint Check**: Runs a lightweight static analysis to find common issues (e.g., use of `var`, `console.log`, unbalanced braces).\n2. **AI Review**: Sends valid code to Gemini AI, which provides human-like review feedback with severity classification (`Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`) and visual highlights (red/orange tags).\n3. **Formatter**: Combines lint and AI results, calculating an overall score (0–10).\n4. **Aggregator**: Summarizes results for quick comparison.\n5. **Google Sheets Writer**: Appends results to your review log.\n6. **Slack Notification**: Posts a concise summary (e.g., number of issues and average score) to your team’s channel.\n\n### How to set up\n1. Connect **Google Sheets** and **Slack** credentials in n8n.\n2. Replace placeholders (`&lt;YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID&gt;`, `&lt;YOUR_SHEET_GID_OR_NAME&gt;`, `&lt;YOUR_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID&gt;`).\n3. Adjust the AI review prompt or lint rules as needed.\n4. Activate the workflow — reviews will start automatically whenever new code is added to the sheet.\n\n### Requirements\n- Google Sheets and Slack integrations enabled\n- A configured AI node (Gemini, OpenAI, or compatible)\n- Proper permissions to write to your target Google Sheet\n\n### How to customize\n- Add more linting rules (naming conventions, spacing, forbidden APIs)\n- Extend the AI prompt for project-specific guidelines\n- Customize the Slack message formatting\n- Export analytics to a dashboard (e.g., Notion or Data Studio)\n\n### Why it’s valuable\nThis workflow brings **realistic, team-oriented AI-assisted code review** to n8n — combining the speed of automated linting with the nuance of human-style feedback. It saves time, improves code quality, and keeps your team’s review history transparent and centralized.",
