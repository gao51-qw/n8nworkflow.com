  "description": "# Sync Android drawable assets from Figma to GitHub via PR (multi‑density PNG)\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically fetches design assets (icons, buttons) from Figma, exports them into Android drawable folder formats based on resolution (e.g., `mdpi`, `hdpi`, etc.) and commits them to a GitHub branch, creating a Pull Request with all updates.\n\n## Who’s it for\n\n- **Android / Flutter developers** managing multiple screen densities.\n- **Design + Dev teams** wanting to automate asset delivery from Figma to codebase.\n- **Mobile teams** tired of manually exporting assets, resizing, organizing and uploading to GitHub.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Execute Flow** manually or via trigger.\n2. Fetches all export URLs from a Figma file.\n3. Filters out only relevant components (`Icon`, `Button`).\n4. Prepares Android drawable folders for each density.\n5. Merges components with folder mapping.\n6. Calls Figma export API to get image URLs.\n7. Filters out empty/invalid URLs.\n8. Downloads all images as binary.\n9. Merges images with metadata.\n10. Renames and adjusts file names if needed.\n11. Prevents duplicate PRs using conditional checks.\n12. Commits files and opens a GitHub Pull Request.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Set up your Figma token** (with file access)\n2. **Get Figma File Key** and desired parent node ID\n3. Connect your **GitHub account** in n8n\n4. Prepare a **GitHub branch** for uploading assets\n5. Add your **drawable folders config**\n6. Adjust file naming logic as per your code style\n7.
