  "description": "### How it works\nThis workflow automates the job curation process by retrieving pending job search inputs from a spreadsheet, querying the JSearch API for relevant job listings, and writing the curated results back to another sheet. It is designed to streamline job discovery and reduce manual data entry.\n\n### Step-by-step\n**1. Trigger & Input**\n- The workflow starts on a defined schedule (e.g., once per day).\n\n- It reads a row from the Job Scraper sheet where the status is marked as \"Pending\".\n\n- The selected row includes fields like Position and Location, which are used to build the search query.\n\n**2. Job Search & Processing**\n- Sends a search request to the JSearch API using the Position and Location from the spreadsheet.\n\n- Parses the API response and extracts individual job listings.\n\n- Filters out empty, irrelevant, or invalid entries to ensure clean and relevant job data.\n\n**3. Output & Status Update**\n- Writes valid job listings to the Job Listing output sheet with fields such as job title, company name, location, and more.\n\n- Updates the original row in the source sheet to mark it as Scraped, ensuring it will not be processed again in future runs.\n\n### **Benefits**\n- Reduces manual effort in job research and listing.\n\n- Ensures only valid, structured data is stored and used.\n\n- Prevents duplicate processing with automatic status updates.\n\n- Simple to expand by adding more job sources or filters.",
