  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template is a hands-on tutorial for one of n8n's most powerful data tools: the **Compare Datasets** node. It's the perfect next step after learning basic logic, showing you how to build robust data synchronization workflows.\n\nWe use a simple **Warehouse Audit** analogy to make the concept crystal clear:\n*   **Warehouse A:** Our main, \"source of truth\" database. This is the master list of what our inventory *should* be.\n*   **Warehouse B:** A second, remote database (like a Notion page or Google Sheet) that we need to keep in sync.\n*   **The Compare Datasets Node:** This is our **Auditor**. It takes both inventory lists and meticulously compares them to find any discrepancies.\n\nThe Auditor then sorts every item into one of four categories, which correspond to the node's four outputs:\n1.  **In A only:** New products found in our main warehouse that need to be **added** to Warehouse B.\n2.  **Same:** Products that match perfectly in both warehouses. **No action needed!**\n3.  **Different:** Products that exist in both places but have different details (e.g., stock count). These need to be **updated** in Warehouse B.\n4.  **In B only:** Extra products found in Warehouse B that aren't in our master list. These need to be **deleted**.\n\nThis pattern is the foundation for any two-way data sync you'll ever need to build.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: 0 minutes!**\n\nThis workflow is a self-contained tutorial and requires no setup or credentials.\n\n1.  Click **\"Execute Workflow\"** to start the audit.\n2.  Explore the two `Set` nodes (\"Warehouse A\" and \"Warehouse B\") to see the initial data we are comparing.\n3.  Click on **\"The Auditor\" (Compare Datasets node)** to see how it's configured to use `product_id` as the matching key.\n4.  Follow the outputs to the four `NoOp` nodes to see which products were sorted into each category.\n5.  Read the sticky notes next to each output—they explain exactly why each item ended up there.",
