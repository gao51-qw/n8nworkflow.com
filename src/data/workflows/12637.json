Your call must be named exactly as the Google Class you want the call to be uploaded to. \nIf the class is found, it will extract the Class ID. This flow assumes that you have a specific topic used for storing class recordings and materials, so it will look for this topic and upload the material. If topic is not found, you'll get an email.\n\n## Requirements\nYou'll need a:\n- Zoom paid plan that supports Zoom Cloud\n- Google cloud console to set up Classroom API and Gmail API\n- OpenAI API key or any other provider",
