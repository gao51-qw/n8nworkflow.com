  "description": "## Who this is for\n\nThis workflow is designed for Finance teams, accounting professionals, and automation engineers.\n\n## **Use Case:**\n  Automates processing of invoice submissions received via JotForm.\n\n* **Core Function:**\n  Extracts structured data such as:\n\n  * Invoice number\n  * Client information\n  * Totals and tax amounts\n  * Line items or services\n\n* **Key Benefit:**\n  Eliminates manual data entry, saving time and reducing human error.\n\n* **Automation Goal:**\n  Streamline document handling with AI-powered PDF parsing and structured output generation.\n\nIdeal users include:\n\n* Accounting or finance teams handling form-based invoice uploads\n* Automation specialists using n8n for document processing\n* Developers integrating invoice data into Google Sheets or CRMs\n\n## What problem this workflow solves\n\nManually extracting structured data from invoice PDFs submitted through JotForm is time-consuming, error-prone, and repetitive.\n\nThis workflow solves that by:\n\n- Automatically receiving the PDF through JotForm’s webhook\n- Extracting structured fields (invoice number, company, client, line items, totals, etc.) using GPT-4-mini\n- Saving the extracted data directly to Google Sheets\n- Writing structured JSON data to disk for archival or further processing\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. **Webhook Trigger (JotForm → n8n)**\n   JotForm submission sends invoice data and attachment link to n8n.\n\n2. **Parse Submission & Extract Metadata**\n   Extracts submission metadata (form ID, user details, invoice number, file link, etc.) using the *Information Extractor* node.\n\n3. **Download PDF Attachment**\n   Fetches the uploaded PDF from JotForm’s secure file URL via the **HTTP Request** node, authenticated using a JotForm API key.\n\n4. **Store & Process File**\n   Saves the invoice to disk and prepares it for AI processing.\n\n5. **Extract Invoice Text Content**\n   Uses the **Extract from File** node to parse text from the PDF document.\n\n6. **AI-Powered Structured Extraction (OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini)**\n   Sends the extracted text to a LangChain LLM Chain with a Structured Output Parser, ensuring consistent JSON output aligned with a defined schema.\n\n7. **Save Extracted Data**\n\n   * Writes structured JSON to disk\n   * Appends parsed results to Google Sheets for easy reporting\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* A **JotForm account** with a form containing an invoice PDF upload field\n\nYou may build the invoice Jotform by leveraging the [Jotform Templates](https://www.jotform.com/form-templates/search/Invoice)\n\n![Invoice Upload Form](fileId:3025)\n\n\n* A **Google Sheets account** with a connected spreadsheet\n* **OpenAI**\n* n8n running locally or on a server with public webhook access (e.g. via `loca.lt`, `ngrok`, or n8n.cloud)\n* Make sure to get the Jotform API Key via the [Jotform Account API Key](https://www.jotform.com/myaccount/api)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Import the provided JSON into n8n**\n\n   * Go to **n8n → Workflows → Import from File/Clipboard**\n   * Paste the provided JSON definition\n\n2. **Configure Webhook**\n\n   * Copy the webhook URL from the *Webhook* node\n   * Paste it into your JotForm’s **Settings → Integrations → Webhook** URL\n\n3. **Set API Keys & Credentials**\n\n   * Ensure the Jotform API key has been setup to download the Jotform PDF document\n   * Ensure your Google Sheets and OpenAI credentials are connected\n\n4. **Test Submission**\n\n   * Submit your JotForm with an invoice PDF\n   * n8n workflow will trigger automatically\n\n5. **Check Outputs**\n\n   * Open your Google Sheet to see structured invoice entries\n   * Check the disk folder (e.g., `C:\\Invoices`) for JSON exports\n\n## How to customize this workflow\n\n* **Change AI Model**\n  Use the OpenAI Chat Model for Structured Data node.\n  → Replace `gpt-4.1-mini` with `gemini-1.5-pro` or any other LLM node of your choice.\n\n* **Adjust Output Schema**\n  Modify the **Structured Output Parser** node.\n  → Edit the JSON schema to match your desired output fields and format.\n\n* **Save to a Different Location**\n  In the **Write the Structured Invoice to Disk** node,\n  → Update the file path pattern (e.g. `/data/invoices/{{invoiceId}}.json`).\n\n* **Log to a Database Instead of Google Sheets**\n  Replace the Append or Update Row in Sheet node\n  → with a MySQL or PostgreSQL node for database logging.\n\n* **Add Notifications**\n  Extend the workflow by adding Slack or Email nodes\n  → to send alerts when a new invoice extraction is completed.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Structured Invoice Data Extraction from JotForm PDFs via Google Gemini, Converts JotForm-uploaded invoice PDFs into structured financial data automatically.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* No manual parsing fully automated\n* Works with any invoice layout via AI\n* Saves structured results to Google Sheets + JSON file\n* Extensible for CRMs, QuickBooks, or ERP sync\n",
