  "description": "# 🧹 Auto-Clean CSV Uploads Before Import  \n\nThis workflow automatically **cleans, validates, and standardizes any CSV file** you upload. Perfect for preparing customer lists, sales leads, product catalogs, or any messy datasets before pushing them into Google Sheets, Google Drive, or other systems.  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works  \n\n1. **CSV Upload (Webhook)**  \n   - Upload your CSV via webhook (supports **form-data**, **base64**, or binary file upload).  \n   - Handles files up to ~10MB comfortably.  \n\n2. **Extract & Parse**  \n   - Reads raw CSV content.  \n   - Validates file structure and headers.  \n   - Detects and normalizes column names (e.g. `First Name` → `first_name`).  \n\n3. **Clean & Standardize Data**  \n   - **Removes duplicate rows** (based on email or all fields).  \n   - **Deletes empty rows**.  \n   - **Standardizes fields**:  \n     - Emails → lowercased, validated format.  \n     - Phone numbers → normalized `(xxx) xxx-xxxx` or `+1 format`.  \n     - Names → capitalized (John Smith).  \n     - Text → trims spaces & fixes inconsistent spacing.  \n   - Assigns each row a **data quality score** so you know how “clean” it is.  \n\n4. **Generate Cleaned CSV**  \n   - Produces a cleaned CSV file with the same headers.  \n   - Saves to Google Drive (optional).  \n   - Ready for immediate import into Sheets or any app.  \n\n5. **Google Sheets Integration (Optional)**  \n   - Clears out an existing sheet.  \n   - Re-imports the cleaned rows.  \n   - Perfect for always keeping your “master sheet” clean.  \n\n6. **Final Report**  \n   - Logs processing summary:  \n     - Rows before & after cleaning.  \n     - Duplicates removed.  \n     - Low-quality rows removed.  \n     - Average data quality score.  \n   - Outputs a neat summary for auditing.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Steps  \n\n1. **Upload Method**  \n   - Use the webhook endpoint generated by the `CSV Upload Webhook` node.  \n   - Send CSV via binary upload, base64 encoding, or JSON payload with `csv_content`.  \n\n2. **Google Drive (Optional)**  \n   - Connect your Drive OAuth credentials.  \n   - Replace `YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` with your target folder.  \n\n3. **Google Sheets (Optional)**  \n   - Connect Google Sheets OAuth.  \n   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` with your target sheet ID.  \n\n4. **Customize Cleaning Rules**  \n   - Adjust the `Clean & Standardize Data` code node if you want different cleaning thresholds (default = 30% minimum data quality).  \n\n---\n\n## 📊 Example Cleaning Report  \n\n**Input file:** `raw_leads.csv`  \n- Rows before: **2,450**  \n- Rows after cleaning: **1,982**  \n- Duplicates removed: **210**  \n- Low-quality rows removed: **258**  \n- Avg. data quality: **87%**  \n\n✅ Clean CSV saved to Drive  \n✅ Clean data imported into Google Sheets  \n✅ Full processing report generated  \n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Why Use This?  \n\n- Stop wasting time manually cleaning CSVs.  \n- Ensure **high-quality, import-ready data** every time.  \n- Works with **any dataset**: leads, contacts, e-commerce exports, logs, surveys.  \n- Completely free — a must-have utility in your automation toolbox.  \n\n---\n\n⚡ Upload dirty CSV → Get **clean, validated, standardized data** instantly!  \n",
