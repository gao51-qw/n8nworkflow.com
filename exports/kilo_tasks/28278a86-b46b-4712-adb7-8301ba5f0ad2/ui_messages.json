With Tailwind handling most other styling, I focused on user feedback: I added loading states, success, and error messages to `SubmitWorkflowForm`. The search page's loading spinner remains. Lastly, I've refined navigation by fixing the `FilterBar` to maintain query parameters and updated the search script to include filters. Now, to the todo list!\n\n\n","partial":false},{"ts":1768188990948,"type":"say","say":"checkpoint_saved","text":"20aaa648ee087bbf4a2d089c4fe542ee85101bc2","checkpoint":{"from":"39e848fa37f72dcb2999dce06ffd7208c54a78fc","to":"20aaa648ee087bbf4a2d089c4fe542ee85101bc2","suppressMessage":false}},{"ts":1768188990949,"type":"ask","ask":"tool","text":"{\"tool\":\"updateTodoList\",\"todos\":[]}","partial":true},{"ts":1768188991124,"type":"say","say":"api_req_started","text":"{\"apiProtocol\":\"openai\",\"tokensIn\":50656,\"tokensOut\":571,\"cacheWrites\":0,\"cacheReads\":46442,\"cost\":0.0061421,\"usageMissing\":false,\"inferenceProvider\":\"Google AI Studio\"}"},{"ts":1768188998403,"type":"say","say":"reasoning","text":"**Concluding the task completion**\n\nI've successfully finished all the required steps.
