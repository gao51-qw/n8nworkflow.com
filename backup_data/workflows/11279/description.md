# 🚀 **Automated LinkedIn Post Generator from Article Links (Telegram → AI → Google Sheets → LinkedIn)**

This workflow lets you collect article links through a Telegram bot, automatically analyze and summarize them with AI, store everything neatly in Google Sheets, and generate polished LinkedIn posts **on demand** whenever the user types “generate”.

Perfect for creators, marketers, and founders who want to post consistently without spending hours analyzing articles or writing drafts.

# 🧠 **How It Works**

### **1️⃣ User Sends Articles via Telegram**

Your Telegram bot is the main input point.
Whenever the user drops a link, the workflow:

* Detects the URL
* Fetches the content
* Sends it to AI for analysis

This keeps the process simple.

---

### **2️⃣ AI Analyzes & Summarizes the Article**

The workflow uses your LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to:

* Summarize the article
* Extract key insights
* Identify main arguments
* Capture tone and context

It produces a clean, structured dataset for each link.

---

### **3️⃣ Everything is Saved into Google Sheets**

Each article becomes a new row in your Google Sheet.
The sheet serves as your **content library** with fields like:

* Date
* Title
* Link
* Summary
* Insights Commentary

You can save dozens of articles and generate posts from any of them later.

---

### **4️⃣ User Requests a Post with “generate”**

When the user types **“generate”**, the workflow will:

* Pull the latest article(s) from Google Sheets (or any selection logic you choose)
* Build a LinkedIn-ready post using AI
* Apply the requested tone/style
* Format it as a clean, professional post

The final post is sent right back to Telegram — ready to copy/paste into LinkedIn.
