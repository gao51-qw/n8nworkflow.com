This workflow facilitates seamless synchronization between Entra (Microsoft Azure AD) and Zammad. It automates the following processes:

1. **Fetch Entra Group Members**: Retrieves users from a designated Entra group. These users are candidates for synchronization.
2. **Create Universal User Object**: Extracts key user information, such as email, phone, and name, and formats it for Zammad compatibility.
3. **Synchronize with Zammad**:
   - Identifies users in Zammad who need updates based on Entra data.
   - Adds new users from Entra to Zammad.
   - Deactivates users in Zammad if they are no longer in the Entra group.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Matching**: Compares users from Entra with existing Zammad users based on email and updates records accordingly.
- **Efficient Management**: Automatically creates, updates, or deactivates Zammad users based on their status in Entra.
- **Custom Fields**: Supports custom field mapping, ensuring enriched user profiles in Zammad.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Microsoft Entra Integration**:
   - Ensure proper API permissions for accessing Entra groups and members.
   - Configure Microsoft OAuth2 credentials in n8n.

2. **Zammad Integration**:
   - Set up Zammad API credentials with appropriate access rights.
   - Customize the workflow to include additional fields or map existing fields as needed.

3. **Run Workflow**:
   - Trigger the workflow manually or set up an automation schedule (e.g., daily sync).
   - Review created/updated/deactivated users in Zammad.

## Use Cases

- **IT Administration**: Keep your support system in sync with the organization’s Entra data.
- **User Onboarding**: Automatically onboard new hires into Zammad based on Entra groups.
- **Access Management**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date user records in Zammad.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Entra (Azure AD) environment with group data.
- A Zammad instance with API credentials for user management.
- A custom field in Zammad User Object (`entra_key`) of type `String`.
