  "description": "This workflow automates the process of handling conversation transcriptions and distributing key information across your organization. Here's what it does:\n\n**Trigger:** The workflow is initiated via a webhook that receives a transcription (e.g., from a call or meeting).\n\n**Summarization & Extraction:** Using AI, the transcription is summarized, and key information is extracted — such as action items, departments involved, and client details.\n\n**Department Notifications:** The relevant summarized information is automatically routed to specific departments via email based on content classification.\n\n**CRM Sync:** The summarized version is saved to the associated contact or deal in HubSpot for future reference and visibility.\n\n**Multi-Channel Alerts: **The summary is also sent via WhatsApp and Slack to keep internal teams instantly informed, regardless of platform.\n\n**Use Case:**\nIdeal for sales, customer service, or operations teams who manage client conversations and want to ensure seamless cross-departmental communication, documentation, and follow-up.\n\n**Apps Used:**\n\nWebhook (Trigger)\n\nOpenAI (or other AI/NLP for summarization)\n\nHubSpot\n\nEmail\n\nSlack\n\nWhatsApp (via Twilio or third-party provider)\n\n",
