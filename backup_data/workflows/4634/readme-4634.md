Streamlined Setup Guide 🛠️:

1️⃣ Install the "API Ninja" plugin

2️⃣ n8n Webhook Configuration:
(choose a username and password).

3️⃣ Stream Deck Buttons:
* Create three "API Ninja" buttons on your Stream Deck.
* Configure each button to make a POST request to its corresponding n8n webhook

4️⃣ Google Calendar Connection:
* In each of the "Get the Events..." and "Push All Meetings..." Google Calendar nodes, select your Google Calendar account (or create a new credential).
* Update the "Calendar" field

5️⃣ Activate & Test! Your Stream Deck buttons should now be ready to dynamically adjust your day.

Important Notes 📝:

    Calendar Selection: Ensure you've correctly selected your target calendar in all Google Calendar nodes.
    Error Handling: The workflow includes basic error handling to respond with a 500 error if issues occur (like not finding events), otherwise, it responds with a 200 success code.
    Attendee Impact: Remember this will move all remaining events for the day and send updates to all attendees of those events.

Take control of your schedule with this powerful Stream Deck and n8n automation. Never stress about manually pushing meetings again! ✨
