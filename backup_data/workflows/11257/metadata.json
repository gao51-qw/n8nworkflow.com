  "description": "## Task-based Assignee billing via Time Tracking\nThis workflow automates billing by scanning a target Dartboard on schedule, aggregating time logs from completed tasks, cross‑referencing assignee rates in Google Sheets, calculating total pay, and updating the sheet with final billable hours and amounts.\n\n### Who's it for\nIndividuals, agencies, companies, and project managers automating payroll or client invoicing from task data.\n\n### How to setup\n- Link your [Dart](https://help.dartai.com/en/articles/12313191-n8n-integration) and Google accounts.\n- Replace the dummy ID in the **List tasks** node with your actual target Dartboard ID.\n- Set your preferred run frequency (e.g., Weekly).\n- Create a Google Sheet with these exact headers: `Name`, `HourlyRate`, `TotalHours`, `TotalPay`, `DateCalculated`.\n- Connect the Sheet nodes to your file. Pre-fill `Name` (matching Dart Assignees exactly) and `HourlyRate` in your Google Spreadsheet.\n- Optional: Add a last header column in the sheet as a Status header to track if the bill is paid or pending.\n\n### Customizing the workflow\n- Choose your AI model for your AI time tracking and assignee scanner\n- Use your own google sheet account and target spreadsheet document",
