  "description": "This workflow sends a file to a Notion database of your choosing when a new file is created in a specific Google Drive folder.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Notion account and [Notion credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/notion/).\n- Google account and [Google credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/github/).\n- Google Drive folder to monitor for new files.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen a Google Drive file is created in the folder you specified, the workflow sends the file to the Notion database you created. The workflow uses the `On file upload` node to trigger the workflow when a new file is created in the folder. The `Create database page` node creates a new page in the Notion database you created.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Create a Notion database called \"My Google Drive Files\" with the following columns:\n    - Filename\n    - Google Drive File\n2. Share the database to n8n.\n3. In the n8n workflow, click on the `Create database page` node and select the database you created in step 1.\n4. In Google Drive, create a folder and navigate to it.\n5. Copy the URL of the Google Drive folder you are currently in.\n6. In the n8n workflow, add the folder URL to `On file upload` node.",
