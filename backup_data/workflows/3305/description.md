Hey! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

We design tools to help companies improve their **logistics processes** using data analytics, AI, and automation—to **reduce costs and minimize environmental impact**.

### Who is this template for?

This workflow template is designed for **logistics operations** that need a monitoring solution for their **distribution chains**.

Connected to your Transportation Management Systems, this AI agent can answer any question about the shipments handled by your distribution teams.

### How does it work?

The workflow is connected to a **Google BigQuery** table that stores **outbound order data** (customer deliveries).

Here’s what the AI agent does:
1. 🤔 Receives a user question via chat.  
2. 🧠 Understands the request and **generates the correct SQL query**.  
3. ✅ Executes the SQL query using a **BigQuery** node.  
4. 💬 Responds to the user in **plain English**.

Thanks to the chat memory, users can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into the data.

### What do I need to get started?

This workflow requires **no advanced programming skills**.

You’ll need:
- A **Google BigQuery account** with an SQL table storing transactional records.
- An **OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o) for the chat model.

### Next Steps
