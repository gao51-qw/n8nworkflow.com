  "description": "### Daily AI News Summary & Gmail Delivery\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to build an autonomous AI agent that automatically scours the web for the latest news, intelligently summarizes the top stories, and delivers a professional, formatted news digest directly to your email inbox.\n\nUse cases are many: Create a personalized daily briefing to start your day informed, keep your team updated on industry trends and competitor news, or automate content curation for your newsletter.\n\n**Good to know**\n\n*   At the time of writing, costs will depend on the LLM you select via **OpenRouter** and your usage of the **Tavily Search API**. Both services offer free tiers to get started.\n*   This workflow requires API keys and credentials for OpenRouter, Tavily, and Gmail.\n*   The AI Agent's system prompt is configured to produce summaries in **Japanese**. You can easily change the language and topics by editing the prompt in the \"AI News Agent\" node.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1.  The workflow begins on a daily schedule, which you can configure to your preferred time.\n2.  A **Code node** dynamically generates a search query for the current day's most important news across several categories.\n3.  The **AI Agent** receives this query. It uses its attached tools to perform the task:\n    *   It uses the **Tavily News Search** tool to find relevant, up-to-date articles from the web.\n    *   It then uses the **OpenRouter Chat Model** to analyze the search results, identify the most significant stories, and write a summary for each.\n    *   The agent's output is strictly structured into a JSON format, containing a main title and an array of individual news stories.\n4.  Another **Code node** takes this structured JSON data and transforms it into a clean, professional HTML-formatted email.\n5.  Finally, the **Gmail node** sends the beautifully formatted email to your specified recipient.\n\n**How to use**\n\n*   Before you start, you must add your credentials for **OpenRouter**, **Tavily**, and **Gmail** in their respective nodes.\n*   Customize the schedule in the \"Schedule Trigger\" node to set the daily delivery time.\n*   Change the recipient's email address in the final \"Send a message\" (Gmail) node.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n*   OpenRouter account (for access to various LLMs)\n*   Tavily AI account (for the real-time search API)\n*   Google account with Gmail enabled for sending emails via OAuth2\n\n**Customising this workflow**\n\n*   **Change the delivery channel:** Easily swap the final Gmail node for a Slack, Discord, or Telegram node to send the news summary to a team channel.\n*   **Focus the news topics:** Modify the \"Prepare News Query\" node to search for highly specific topics, such as \"latest advancements in artificial intelligence\" or \"financial news from the European market.\"\n*   **Archive the news:** Add a node after the AI Agent to save the structured JSON data to a database or Google Sheet, allowing you to build a searchable news archive over time.",
