## Analyze crypto markets with interactive graphs using CoinGecko and C1 by Thesys

This n8n template   can answer questions about **real-time prices, market moves, trending coins, and token details** with **interactive UI in real time** (cards, charts, buttons) instead of plain text using C1 by Thesys. Data is fetched through the **CoinGecko Free MCP tool**.

### [Check out a working demo of this template here](https://www.thesys.dev/n8n?url=https://www.thesys.dev/n8n?url=https%3A%2F%2Fasd2224.app.n8n.cloud%2Fwebhook%2F51638b0c-7765-4fa8-9b95-a0422128e203%2Fchat).

### What this workflow does
1. A user sends a message in the **n8n Chat** UI (public chat trigger).
2. The **AI Agent** interprets the request.
3. The agent calls **CoinGecko Free MCP** to fetch market data (prices, coins, trending, etc.).
4. The model responds through **C1 by Thesys** with a **streaming, UI** answer.

### Example prompts you can try right away
Copy/paste any of these into the chat:

- “What’s the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum?”
- “Give me today’s market summary: total market cap, BTC dominance, top gainers/losers.”
- “Compare ETH vs SOL over 30 days with a chart.”

&gt; Note: This template is for information and visualization, not financial advice.


### How it works

1. User sends a prompt
2. C1 model based on prompt will use CoinGecko MCP to fetch live data
3. C1 Model generates a UI Schema Response
4. Schema is rendered as UI using Thesys GenUI SDK on the frontend
