## 📊 Description
 Automate daily founder intelligence from Hacker News without manual monitoring. This workflow scans Hacker News discussions (Show HN, launches, AI, startups, SaaS), filters out noise and non-discussion pages, and extracts only high-signal threads. AI then converts these discussions into a concise, founder-ready daily digest highlighting key trends, why they matter, and practical actions. The digest is delivered via email, while structured insights are logged to Google Sheets for long-term tracking and analysis. 
## ⚠️ Deployment Disclaimer
 This template is designed for self-hosted n8n installations only.
 It relies on external MCP tools and custom AI orchestration that are not supported on n8n Cloud.
