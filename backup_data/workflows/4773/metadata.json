  "title": "Build a document-based AI chatbot with Google Drive, Llama 3, and Qdrant RAG",
  "description": "**Overview**\nThis template allows users to set up an AI-powered chatbot that retrieves and processes knowledge from Google Drive documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By leveraging Llama 3 for natural language responses and Qdrant vector storage for document embeddings, this chatbot provides accurate, context-aware answers based on stored files.\n\n**Problem It Solves**\nStandard AI chatbots often rely on predefined models with limited real-time knowledge access. This workflow overcomes that limitation by:\n\nAutomatically fetching new documents from Google Drive.\n\nEmbedding knowledge for fast retrieval using Qdrant.\n\nGenerating human-like responses with Llama 3 AI.\n\nProviding accurate, source-backed answers in conversations.\n\n**Use Cases**\n✔️ Customer Support – Retrieve and summarize FAQs stored in Google Drive. ✔️ Internal Knowledge Base – Automate document-based query responses. ✔️ AI-powered Research Assistant – Search and generate insights from uploaded files. ✔️ Business Automation – Enhance workflows with document-aware chat interactions.\n\n**Setup Instructions**\n1️⃣ Google Drive Trigger: Detect & Fetch New Documents\nWatches for new files added to a specific Google Drive folder.\n\nRetrieves the latest file metadata and passes it into the workflow.\n\n2️⃣ Processing & Embedding the Document\nThe document is downloaded via the Google Drive node.\n\nText data is split into smaller, retrievable chunks using Recursive Text Splitter.\n\nEmbeddings are created using Ollama’s Nomic-Embed Model.\n\nKnowledge is stored in Qdrant Vector Database for fast AI-powered lookup.\n\n3️⃣ AI Chatbot & Query Handling\nThe Chat Trigger node listens for user queries.\n\nThe AI Agent retrieves context-aware answers by searching Qdrant’s vectorized documents.\n\nThe Llama 3 Model generates human-like responses based on stored knowledge.\n\n**Detailed Workflow Explanation**\n🔹 Google Drive Trigger\n✅ Monitors a specific folder for new documents. ✅ Automatically fetches document metadata when a file is uploaded.\n\n🔹 Qdrant Vector Store\n✅ Stores embedded document text, making retrieval instant & accurate. ✅ Allows the chatbot to reference stored knowledge dynamically.\n\n🔹 Recursive Text Splitter\n✅ Splits long documents into manageable chunks for efficient embedding. ✅ Improves chatbot response accuracy by organizing document data.\n\n🔹 Llama 3 Chat Model\n✅ Generates natural, human-like replies using AI. ✅ Uses retrieved document data for context-aware responses.\n\n**Customization Options**\n🔹 Adjust polling frequency for document updates. 🔹 Expand knowledge base by adding more storage sources. 🔹 Refine chatbot responses with prompt tuning in Llama 3.\n",
