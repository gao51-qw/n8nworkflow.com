  "title": "Collect & summarize multilingual news with NewsAPI, OpenAI & Google Sheets",
  "description": "How it works\nThis workflow automatically collects the latest news articles from both English and Japanese sources using NewsAPI, summarizes them with OpenAI, and appends the results into a Google Sheet. The summaries are concise (about 50 characters) in Japanese, making it easy to review news highlights at a glance.\n\nSet up steps\n1. Create a Google Sheet with two tabs:\n   - 01_Input (columns: Keyword, SearchRequired)\n   - 02_Output (columns: Date, Keyword, Summary, URL)\n2. Enter your own Google Sheet ID and tab names in the workflow.\n3. Add your NewsAPI key in the HTTP Request nodes.\n4. Connect your OpenAI account (or deactivate the summarization node if not needed).\n5. Run the workflow manually or use the daily schedule trigger at 13:00.\n\nThis template is ready to use with minimal changes. Sticky notes inside the workflow provide extra guidance.\n",
