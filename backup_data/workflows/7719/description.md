## 🎯 What this workflow does

This workflow automatically monitors Reddit subreddits for new image posts and downloads them to Google Drive. It's perfect for content creators, meme collectors, or anyone who wants to automatically archive images from their favorite subreddits without manual work.

The workflow intelligently prevents duplicate downloads by checking existing files in Google Drive and sends you Telegram notifications about the download status, so you always know when new content has been saved.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-subreddit monitoring**: Configure multiple subreddits to monitor simultaneously
- **Smart duplicate detection**: Never downloads the same image twice
- **Automated scheduling**: Runs on a customizable cron schedule
- **Real-time notifications**: Get instant Telegram updates about download activity
- **Rate limit friendly**: Built-in delays to respect Reddit's API limits
- **Cloud storage integration**: Direct upload to organized Google Drive folders

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, you'll need:

- **Reddit Developer Account**: Create an app at [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- **Google Cloud Project**: With Drive API enabled and OAuth2 credentials
- **Telegram Bot**: Created via @BotFather with your chat ID
- **Basic n8n knowledge**: Understanding of credentials and node configuration

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Reddit API Access
