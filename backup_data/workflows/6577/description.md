## 🎨 Customization

### How to Adapt for Different Use Cases

- **Collect More Info:**  
  Add fields to your n8n form for details such as name, product type, issue/context, preferred language, etc.  
- **Use Extra Data in Calls:**  
  In the HTTP request node, pass these fields in the API request body to Vapi. Tailor your assistant’s script to reference these for a personalized experience.
- **Conditional Calls:**  
  Add n8n logic nodes to filter/categorize submissions (e.g., only call if a checkbox is ticked or if value matches certain criteria).
- **Dynamic Assistant Selection:**  
  Select assistant or Vapi number based on user responses (e.g., route to different assistants by region or requested service).

## 📇 Using Additional Form Fields in Vapi Calls

- Any field collected on your n8n form can be included in the call payload,  simply add it in the HTTP request payload.
- Vapi can use these variables for dynamically constructing prompts, personalizing the call flow, or branching logic in the interaction.
- Example: If your form collects `first_name` and `appointment_time`, both can be sent to Vapi and referenced in the call script or as variables in your assistant’s logic.
