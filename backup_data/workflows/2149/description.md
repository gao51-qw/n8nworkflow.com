## Use case
Automatically create todo items in Todoist every morning. 

This workflow has two flows
1. At 5am, delete any uncompleted tasks every morning
2. At 5:10 am, copy all template tasks into Inbox

In each template task, set the due dates and days to add the task. You can do that like this `days:mon,tues; due:8pm` which will add the task every Monday and Tuesday and make it due at 8pm.


## How to setup
1. Add Todoist creds
2. Create a `template` list to copy from in Todoist. Add days and due times on each task as necessary.
3. Set the projects to copy from and to write to in each **Todoist** node
