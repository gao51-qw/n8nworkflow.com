Do you want to discover company-related information to enrich a signup process?

This workflow enriches any company by name using the uProc [**Get Company by Name tool**](https://app.uproc.io/#/tools/processor/get/company/by-name).
This tool combines Google Maps and emails research on the internet to return results. You get no results if the company has no presence on Google Maps.

You need to add your credentials (Email and API Key - real -) located at [**Integration section**](https://app.uproc.io/#/settings/integration) to n8n.

You can replace node "Create Company Item" with any other supported service returning Company names and countries, like Hubspot, Google Sheets, MySQL, or Typeform.

You can set up the uProc node with several parameters:

Every "uProc" node returns the next fields per every located company:
