  "description": "## 🎧 Daily RSS Digest & Podcast Generation\n\nThis workflow automates the creation of a daily sports podcast from your favorite news sources. It fetches articles, uses AI to write a digest and a two-person dialogue, and produces a single, merged audio file with KOKORO TTS ready for listening.\n\n## ✨ How it works:\n\n### 📰 Fetch & Filter Daily News: The workflow triggers daily, fetches articles from your chosen RSS feeds, and filters them to keep only the most recent content.\n\n### ✍️ Generate AI Digest & Script: \nUsing Google Gemini, it first creates a written summary of the day's news. A second AI agent then transforms this news into an engaging, conversational podcast script between two distinct AI speakers.\n\n### 🗣️ Generate Voices in Chunks: \nThe script is split into individual lines of dialogue. The workflow then loops through each line, calling a Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to generate a separate audio file (an MP3 chunk) for each part of the conversation.\n\n### 🎛️ Merge Audio with FFmpeg: \nAfter all the audio chunks are created and saved locally, a command-line script generates a list of all the files and uses FFmpeg to losslessly merge them into a single, seamless MP3 file. All temporary files are then deleted.\n\n### 📤 Send the Final Podcast: \nThe final, merged MP3 is read from the server and delivered directly to your Telegram chat with a dynamic, dated filename.\n\n### You can modify:\n- 📰 The RSS Feeds to any news source you want.\n- 🤖 The AI Prompts to change the tone, language, or style of the digest and podcast.\n- 🎙️ The TTS Voices used for the two speakers.\n- 📫 The Final Delivery Method (e.g., send to Discord, save to Google Drive, etc.).\n\n\nPerfect for creating a personalized, hands-free news briefing to listen to on your commute.\n\n**Inspired by:** https://n8n.io/workflows/6523-convert-newsletters-into-ai-podcasts-with-gpt-4o-mini-and-elevenlabs/",
