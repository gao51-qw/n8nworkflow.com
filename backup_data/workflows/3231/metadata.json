  "description": "This workflow enables users to perform web searches directly from Telegram using the Brave search engine. By simply sending the command /brave followed by a query, the workflow retrieves search results from Brave and returns them as a Telegram message.\n\nThis workflow is ideal for users who want a quick and private way to search the web without switching between apps. 🚀\n\nThis workflow is a powerful tool for automating interactions with Brave tools through Telegram, providing users with quick and easy access to information directly in their chat.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the workflow:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. How It Works**\nThe workflow is designed to process user queries from Telegram, execute a Brave tool via the MCP Client, and send the results back to the user. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Telegram Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Telegram Trigger** node, which listens for new messages in a Telegram chat.\n   - When a message is received, the workflow checks if it starts with the command `/brave`.\n\n2. **Filter Messages**:\n   - The **If** node filters messages that start with `/brave`. If the message doesn't start with `/brave`, the workflow stops.\n\n3. **Edit Fields**:\n   - The **Edit Fields** node extracts the text of the message for further processing.\n\n4. **Clean Query**:\n   - The **Clean Query** node removes the `/brave` command from the message, leaving only the user's query.\n\n5. **List Brave Tools**:\n   - The **List Brave Tools** node retrieves the list of available tools from the MCP Client.\n\n6. **Execute Brave Tool**:\n   - The **Exec Brave Tool** node executes the first tool in the list using the cleaned query as input.\n\n7. **Send Message**:\n   - The **Send Message** node sends the result of the Brave tool execution back to the user in the Telegram chat.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Preliminary Steps**\n- Access to an n8n self-hosted instance and install the Community node \"n8n-nodes-mcp\". Please see this [easy guide](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp)\n- Get your Brave Search API Key: https://brave.com/search/api/\n- Telegram Bot Access Token\n\nIn \"List Brave Tools\" create new credential as shown in  this image\n![image](https://github.com/nerding-io/n8n-nodes-mcp/raw/main/assets/credentials-envs.png)\n\nIn Environment field set this value:\nBRAVE_API_KEY=your-api-key\n\n---\n\n\n#### **3. Set Up Steps**\nTo set up and use this workflow in n8n, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Telegram Configuration**:\n   - Set up **Telegram** credentials in n8n for the **Telegram Trigger** and **Send Message** nodes.\n   - Ensure the Telegram bot is authorized to read messages and send responses in the chat.\n\n2. **MCP Client Configuration**:\n   - Set up **MCP Client** credentials in n8n for the **List Brave Tools** and **Exec Brave Tool** nodes.\n   - Ensure the MCP Client is configured to interact with Brave tools.\n\n3. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Send a message starting with `/brave` followed by a query (e.g., `/brave search for AI tools`) to the Telegram chat.\n   - The workflow will:\n     - Process the query.\n     - Execute the Brave tool via the MCP Client.\n     - Send the result back to the Telegram chat.\n\n4. **Optional Customization**:\n   - Modify the workflow to include additional features, such as:\n     - Adding more commands or tools.\n     - Integrating with other APIs or services for advanced use cases.\n     - Sending notifications via other channels (e.g., email, Slack)\n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
