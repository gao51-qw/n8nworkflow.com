  "description": "This workflow is a production-ready **Meta Ads Webhook dispatcher** for the **Ad Account** object. It receives webhook deliveries from Meta, returns the required acknowledgement, routes events by `field`, logs them to Google Sheets (separate tabs per event type), and sends a compact Slack notification with counts.\n\n#### **Use Case**\nMeta webhooks are powerful, but the “last mile” is usually missing: storing raw events, making them readable, and triggering the next automation reliably. This workflow is ideal if you want to:\n- **Centralize all Meta Ads webhook events** in one place (one endpoint, one workflow).\n- **Log every event** for auditing and analysis (Google Sheets).\n- **Get lightweight alerts** in Slack (count-based, not spammy).\n- **Trigger downstream workflows** depending on the webhook type (e.g., Creative Fatigue → replace creatives in the affected ad set).\n\n#### **How it Works**\nThe workflow is organized into clear blocks:\n\n**1. Webhook endpoint + verification**\n- A **Webhook** trigger receives requests from Meta.\n- The workflow detects **verification requests** (`hub.mode=subscribe`) and validates the **Verify Token**.\n- It responds with the **hub.challenge** value so you can successfully subscribe your webhook in Facebook Developers.\n\n**2. Route by event field**\n- For real webhook deliveries (`object=ad_account`), the workflow routes execution by:\n  - `creative_fatigue`\n  - `ad_recommendations`\n  - `ads_async_creation_request`\n  - `in_process_ad_objects`\n  - `product_set_issue`\n  - `with_issues_ad_objects`\n\n**3. Acknowledge every webhook delivery**\n- For each branch, the workflow immediately returns a JSON acknowledgement (e.g., `{ \"status\": \"received\", \"field\": \"...\", \"webhook_type\": \"...\" }`), so Meta considers the delivery successful.\n\n**4. Normalize + log to Google Sheets**\n- The workflow splits array payloads (Meta can send multiple `entry` items and multiple `changes`).\n- Each event type is appended to its own Google Sheets tab (one spreadsheet, multiple sheets), with the raw webhook body also saved for future debugging.\n\n**5. Summarize + notify**\n- All event logs are merged and summarized to compute a compact count per `field`.\n- A Slack node sends a short message like “New Meta Webhook / Type / Count” with a link to the spreadsheet.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n**1. Create and configure a Meta app**\n- Create an app in [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).\n- Add the **Webhooks** product.\n- Subscribe to the **Ad Account** object.\n- Configure:\n  - **Callback URL** (your n8n webhook URL)\n  - **Verify Token** (must match the value in the workflow)\n\n**2. Configure the Webhook node**\n- Set the webhook **path**.\n- Use the **Production URL** when you go live.\n\n**3. Connect credentials**\n- Connect **Google Sheets** OAuth credentials in all Google Sheets nodes.\n- Connect **Slack** credentials and choose your target channel.\n\n**4. Update Google Sheets destinations**\n- Set your **Spreadsheet ID** and ensure the expected sheet tabs exist (one per supported webhook field).\n\n**5. Activate**\n- Save and activate the workflow.\n- Trigger a verification request from Facebook Developers to confirm everything is wired correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Testing**\nTo test the dispatcher before going live, use the open-source tool: [meta-ads-webhook-tester](https://github.com/KhatkevichKirill/meta-ads-webhook-tester).\n\n---\n\n### **Further Ideas & Customization**\n- **Add Telegram**: duplicate the Slack notification step and send the same summary message to Telegram.\n- **Trigger automations**: after routing by `field`, execute another workflow (e.g., Creative Fatigue → fetch affected ad set → rotate creatives).\n- **Hardening**: add de-duplication (event IDs), retries, and a dead-letter/error sheet tab for failed log writes.\n",
