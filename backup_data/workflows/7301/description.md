Let AI classify your incoming emails and draft replies.
Use gotoHuman to approve emails before they are sent out. It also lets you manually edit the draft or even ask for a retry.

## How it works
1. The workflow is triggered for each new email which gets passed to an **AI classification agent**.
It assigns the email to one of the categories defined in the prompt (Customer Support, Sales opportunity, Promo, Personal,...). The agent also determines whether a reply is needed and if it is important.
2. If a reply is needed, we ask the **AI Email Writer** to draft a response. Even if it is missing context it can help us draft an outline for the response.
3. The email draft is sent to **gotoHuman** where the reviewer can manually edit it or ask to regenerate it with the option to even edit the prompt (Retries loop back to the _AI Email Writer_ node)
