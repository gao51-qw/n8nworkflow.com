  "description": "\nChat with a Slack channel using AI. This workflow fetches the channel’s message history and lets you ask natural-language questions (“what were the decisions?”, “who’s blocked?”, “summarize yesterday”). The assistant **only** answers from the channel’s actual messages—no guessing.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n### 1️⃣ Set Up OpenAI Connection\n1.

Add `chat:write` if you want the bot to reply in Slack.)  \n3. **Install** the app to your workspace → copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**  \n4. In n8n → **Credentials → New → Slack OAuth2 API** → paste token and save  \n5. In the **Slack History** node, select your Slack credential and the **Channel ID** to read\n\n---\n\n## 🗣️ Example Questions You Can Ask\n- “Give me a 5-bullet summary of the last 24 hours.”  \n- “What action items were assigned, and to whom?”  \n- “List open questions that haven’t been answered yet.”  \n- “Who was mentioned most this week?”  \n- “Summarize decisions from the last sprint planning.”  \n- “Show messages with the word ‘blocker’ from the past 2 days.”  \n- “What files/links were shared today?”\n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact\nNeed help customizing this or adding auto-replies back into Slack?\n\n- 📧 **robert@ynteractive.com**  \n- 🔗 **[Robert Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/)**  \n- 🌐 **[ynteractive.com](https://ynteractive.com)**\n",
