  "description": "Convert any website into a searchable vector database for AI chatbots. Submit a URL, choose scraping scope, and this workflow handles everything: scraping, cleaning, chunking, embedding, and storing in Supabase.\n\n   ## What it does\n  - Scrapes websites using Apify (3 modes: full site unlimited, full site limited, single URL)\n  - Cleans content (removes navigation, footer, ads, cookie banners, etc)\n  - Chunks text (800 chars, markdown-aware)\n  - Generates embeddings (Google Gemini, 768 dimensions)\n  - Stores in Supabase vector database\n\n  ## Requirements\n  - Apify account + API token\n  - Supabase database with pgvector extension\n  - Google Gemini API key\n\n  ## Setup\n  1. Create Supabase `documents` table with embedding column (vector 768). *[Run this SQL query](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores/supabase) in your Supabase project to enable the vector store setup* \n  2. Add your Apify API token to all three \"Run Apify Scraper\" nodes\n  3. Add Supabase and Gemini credentials\n  4. Test with small site (5-10 pages) or single page/URL first\n\n  ## Next steps\n  Connect your vector store to an AI chatbot for RAG-powered Q&A, or build semantic search features into your apps.\n\n  **Tip:** Start with page limits to test content quality before full-site scraping. Review chunks in Supabase and adjust Apify filters if needed for better vector embeddings.\n\n---\n\n\n## Sample Outputs\n\n**Apify actor \"runs\" in Apify Dashboard from this workflow**\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/NMBqXSWs/Screenshot-2025-11-06-190813.png)\n\n\n**Supabase `docuemnts` table with scraped website content ingested in chunks with vector embeddings**\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W4m0x8MG/Screenshot-2025-11-06-154326.png)\n",
