### Benefits
* **Complete Automation** - An end-to-end solution that handles content generation, image creation, scheduling, and publishing.
* **Elementor-Ready Content** - Creates posts that inherit your client's theme styling and responsiveness, eliminating manual design work.
* **Centralized Management** - Organizes clients, content ideas, and publishing history in a simple **Google Sheets** system.
* **Intelligent AI Creation** - Uses **Google Gemini** to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized content with customizable tone and strict guidelines.
* **Flexible Publishing** - Offers both **on-demand** and **scheduled** triggers to fit any content strategy.

### How It Works

1.  **Flexible Triggers**: The workflow can be initiated in two ways:
    * **Manual Trigger**: Fill out a simple **n8n form** with client details, keywords, and content guidelines for an on-demand post.
    * **Automated Trigger**: The workflow checks a **Google Sheet** hourly and automatically publishes any scheduled posts.
2.  **Centralized Management**: A three-sheet **Google Sheets** system acts as your core database for:
    * **Clients**: Stores client information and **WordPress app credentials**.
    * **Blog Ideas/Schedule**: Your content calendar where you plan and track upcoming posts.
    * **History**: A log of every successfully published post.
3.  **Intelligent AI Content Generation**: An **AI Agent** with a customizable prompt leverages **Google Gemini** to:
    * Analyze competitor URLs to create more comprehensive content.
    * Adhere to strict SEO and formatting guidelines.
    * Generate a unique **featured image** based on the article's keywords.
4.  **Elementor Conversion**: A custom **JavaScript function** parses the AI's HTML output and converts it into a native **Elementor JSON format**. This is the core magic that ensures the post is perfectly structured and responsive.
5.  **Seamless WordPress Integration**: The workflow uses a **WordPress node** to send the post's title and the Elementor JSON data to the client's site, publishing a new blog post that looks as if it was manually created with the Elementor editor.
