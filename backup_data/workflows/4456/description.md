## Who is this for?
This workflow is intended for WhatsApp admins, customer service, individual users or teams in businesses who want to automate their small business or medium to large businesses on WhatsApp practically by automatically replying about your business products or services using Open AI capabilities on AI Agent. Based on an automated system there is a task to answer many customers or clients on WhatsApp, in reality answering one by one is very time consuming and tiring, especially if we have to compose sentences first or click on the template and send them. This is also a form of devotion to the community at n8n and the n8n company, as well as devotion to small businesses so that the reality is no longer tiring and able to answer the problems of reality that exist.

## How does it work?
Easy explanation:

Whatsapp trigger here the "Input submissions" node is responsible for inputting chats from customers in the form of data. Then, it is sent to the next node, namely the if node, here there are two if nodes, namely "Signpost" and "Is text message?" responsible for forwarding customer chat input data and selecting if correct then it will be forwarded to the AI ​​Agent and if wrong then there is a "Fallback Text" node. Once correct, the AI ​​Agent will analyze with the OpenAI model capability and store it in Simple Memory. The AI ​​Agent here has been given directions and commands on what it should be like, in the parameters section, the prompt contains a special task, the knowledge base of your business, and several points and rules that must be there. After that, it will be sent via the WhatsApp reply node which is addressed to the customer. After that, the Gmail Set will process it again to be addressed to the Send Gmail Notifications Node, which contains email address parameters and also the contents of the email as a notification of success or failure. Then, there are no operations after that after the Gmail node. And enjoy this workflow that works for you.

## Setup instructions
Complete what is in the node as stated in the notes column.
You need a "Credential Account" on each WhatsApp node, then the OpenAI node and the Gmail Node. If you already have an account, just connect it, and if not, create it first, you can register it by following the guide from n8n, it makes it very easy.
Because here it has been set up neatly and cleanly like in the if node. Next, you need to add your business to the AI ​​Agent node, there are parameters and a prompt section, I have made a sample here to make it easier for you. You can immediately adjust it to your business or service or product, later what communication or sentence you want to convey to customers on WhatsApp. After that, don't forget to add an email address to the Gmail node for notification of success or failure of each customer from the running of this system.
