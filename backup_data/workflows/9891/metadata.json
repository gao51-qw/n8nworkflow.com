If the job fails, a **Slack** alert is sent.\n* A **Code** node processes the raw scraped data, splitting the list of developers into individual items.\n* An **AI Agent**, powered by **Google Gemini**, analyzes each profile. It scores their resume/summary and calculates a final weighted `FinalScore` based on their followers, repositories, and resume quality.\n* The structured and scored candidate data is then saved to a **Google Sheet**, using the \"Name\" column to prevent duplicates.\n* A final **Slack** message is sent to notify you that the GitHub contributors list has been successfully updated.\n\n---\n### Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping\n* **BrowserAct** \"**Source Top GitHub Contributors by Language & Location**\" Template\n* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))\n* **Gemini** account for the AI Agent\n* **Google Sheets** credentials for saving leads\n* **Slack** credentials for sending notifications\n\n---\n\n### Need Help?\n* #### [How to Find Your BrowseAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDjoZWEsZlE)\n* #### [How to Connect n8n to Browseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* #### [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n* #### [How to Use the BrowserAct N8N Community Node](https://youtu.be/j0Nlba2pRLU)\n\n---\n### Workflow Guidance and Showcase\n\n* #### [Automate Talent Sourcing: Find GitHub Devs with n8n & Browseract](https://youtu.be/TnhnXunNMMU)",
