## Description
This workflow automates Zendesk ticket handling with AI-powered auto-replies. It pulls in new support tickets, checks against a Google Sheets FAQ database, and generates accurate responses using GPT-4o-mini. If the question matches an FAQ, the system replies with the predefined answer; otherwise, it drafts a polite, professional custom response. Finally, the workflow formats and sends the reply via Gmail, ensuring customers always receive quick and reliable support.
