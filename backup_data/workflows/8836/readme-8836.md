# Scrape hotel listings with prices from Booking.com using Brightdata & AI

> This workflow automates the search and extraction of hotel data from **Booking.com**. Triggered by a chat message, it uses a combination of web scraping with **[Bright Data's](https://get.brightdata.com/unstoppable)** Web Scraper and AI-powered data processing with **OpenRouter** to deliver a concise, human-friendly list of hotels.

The final output is a clean and formatted report, making it a valuable tool for travelers, event planners, and business professionals who need to quickly find accommodation options.

## Who's it for

This template is ideal for:
-   **Event Planners:** Quickly identify and compare hotel options for conferences, meetings, or group travel.
-   **Travel Agents:** Efficiently research and provide clients with a curated list of accommodations based on their specified destination.

## How it works

1.  The workflow is triggered by a chat message containing a city name from an n8n chat application.
2.  It uses Bright Data to initiate a web scraping job on Booking.com for the specified city.
3.  The workflow continuously checks the status of the scraping job. Once the data is ready, it downloads the snapshot.
4.  The extracted data is then passed to a custom AI agent powered by OpenRouter.
5.  This AI agent uses a calculator tool to convert prices and an instruction prompt to refine and format the raw data.
6.  The final output is a well-presented list of hotels, ready for display in the chat application.
