  "title": "Automate Service Ticket Triage with GPT-4o & Taiga",
  "description": "**Usecase**: When a new service ticket is created in Taiga, it's often unclear whether it contains sufficient details to begin work. This workflow automates the triage process by:\n\n1. Using an AI model to extract key information from the ticket description.\n2. Automatically assigning values for:\n   - **Type** (Bug, Enhancement, Onboarding, Question)\n   - **Severity** (Wishlist, Minor, Normal, Important, Critical)\n   - **Priority** (Low, Normal, High)\n   - **Status** (New, Needs More Info, etc.)\n3. Detecting missing critical data and blocking the ticket if incomplete.\n\nSetup instructions here:\nhttps://github.com/emooney/Service_Ticket_Triage_Helper\n",
