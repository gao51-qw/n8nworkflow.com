# Solar Energy Production Monitoring Alert Workflow

This workflow automatically monitors solar energy production every 2 hours by fetching data from the Energidataservice API. If the energy output falls below a predefined threshold, it instantly notifies users via email. Otherwise, it logs the data into a Google Sheet and posts a daily summary to Slack.

## Who’s It For

* Renewable energy teams monitoring solar output.
* Facility managers and power plant supervisors.
* ESG compliance officers tracking sustainability metrics.
* Developers or analysts automating solar energy reporting.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts every 2 hours using a Schedule Trigger.
2. **Data Fetch:** An HTTP Request node fetches solar energy production data from the Energidataservice API.
3. **Processing:** A Code node filters out entries with production below the minimum threshold.
4. **Decision Making:** An If node checks whether any low-production entries are present.
5. **Alerts:** If low-production is detected, an email is sent via the Gmail node.
6. **Logging:** If all entries are valid, they are logged into a Google Sheet.
7. **Slack Summary:** A Slack node posts the summary sheet data for end-of-day visibility.

## How to Set Up

1. **Schedule Trigger:** Configure to run every 2 hours.
2. **HTTP Request Node:**
	* Method: `GET`
	* URL: `https://api.energidataservice.dk/dataset/YourDatasetHere`
	* Add necessary headers and params as required by the API.
3. **Code Node:** Define logic to filter entries where `solar_energy_production &lt; required_threshold`.
4. **If Node:** Use `items.length &gt; 0` to check for low-production entries.
5. **Gmail Node:**
	* Auth with Gmail credentials.
	* Customize recipient and message template.
6. **Google Sheets Node:**
	* Connect to a spreadsheet.
	* Map appropriate columns.
7. **Slack Node:**
	* Use Slack OAuth2 credentials.
	* Specify channel and message content.

## Requirements

* n8n Cloud or Self-hosted instance.
* Access to Energidataservice API.
* Gmail account (with n8n OAuth2 integration).
* Google Sheets account & sheet ID.
* Slack workspace and app with appropriate permissions.

## How to Customize

* **Change Frequency:** Adjust the Schedule Trigger interval (e.g., every hour or 4x per day).
* **Threshold Tuning:** Modify the value in the Code node to change the minimum acceptable solar production.
* **Alert Routing:** Update Gmail recipients or replace Gmail with Microsoft Outlook/SendGrid.
* **Sheet Format:** Add or remove columns in the Google Sheet based on extra metrics (e.g., wind or nuclear data).
* **Slack Posting:** Customize Slack messages using Markdown for improved readability.

## Add‑ons

* **Telegram Node:** Send alerts to a Telegram group instead of email.
* **Discord Webhook:** Push updates to a Discord channel.
* **n8n Webhook Trigger:** Extend it to receive external production update notifications.
* **Integromat/Make or Zapier:** For multi-platform integration with CRMs or ticketing tools.

## Use Case Examples

* **Utility Companies:** Automatically detect and act on solar underperformance to maintain grid stability.
* **Solar Farm Operators:** Log clean production data for auditing and compliance reports.
* **Sustainability Teams:** Track daily performance and anomalies without manual checks.
* **Home Solar System Owners:** Get notified if solar generation drops below expected.

## Common Troubleshooting

| **Issue** | **Possible Cause** | **Solution** |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP Request fails | API key missing or URL is incorrect | Check API endpoint, parameters, and authentication headers |
| Gmail not sending alerts | Missing or invalid Gmail credentials | Re-authenticate Gmail OAuth2 in n8n credentials |
| No data getting logged in Google Sheet | Incorrect mapping or sheet permissions | Ensure the sheet exists, columns match, and credentials are correct |
| Slack node fails | Invalid token or missing channel ID | Reconnect Slack credentials and check permissions |
| Code node returns empty | Filter logic may be too strict | Validate data format and relax the threshold condition |
