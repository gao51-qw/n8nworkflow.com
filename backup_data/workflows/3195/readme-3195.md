# 🉑 Generate Anki flash cards for language learning with Google Translate and GPT

> ### Context
Hey! I'm [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), a **Supply Chain Data Scientist from Paris** who spent six years in China studying and working while **struggling to learn Mandarin.**

![I want to study Mandarin (In Mandarin)](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-23.png)

I know the challenges of **mastering a complex language** like Chinese and my greatest support was **flash cards**. Therefore,  I designed this workflow to support fellow Mandarin learners by **automating flashcard creation** using n8n, so they can focus more on learning and less on manual data entry.

### Who is this template for?

#### Why?
If you use the open-source application **Anki**, this workflow will help you automatically generate personalized study materials.

#### How?
Let us imagine you want to learn how to say the word **Contract** in Mandarin.

The workflow will automatically
1. **Translate the word** in Simplified Mandarin *(Mandarin: 合同)*.
2. Provide the **phonetic transcription** *(Pinyin: Hétóng)* 
3. Generate **an example sentence** *(Example: 我们签订了一份合同.)*
4. Download an **illustrative picture** (For example, a picture of a contract signature)

![Example of Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-1.png)

All these fields are automatically recorded in a Google Sheet, making it easy to import into Anki and generate flashcards instantly

### What do I need to start?
This workflow can be used with the free tier plans of the services used. It does not require any advanced programming skills.
#### Prerequisite
- A **Google Drive Account** with a folder including a Google Sheet
- API Credentials: **Google Drive API**, **Google Sheets API** and **Google Translate API** activated with OAuth2 credentials
- A free API key of pexels.com
- A google sheet with the columns
