([Sample PDF generated from comprehensive markdown](https://wisestackai.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/12082025052957.pdf))\n6. **PDF is archived** in a designated Drive folder.\n7. **Archived PDF is downloaded** for sharing.\n8. **Slack message is sent** with the PDF attached.\n\n## **How to set up**\n1. **Add nodes in sequence**:\n   - Manual Trigger\n   - OpenAI Chat Model (prompt to generate sample Markdown)\n   - Set/Manual input for Google Drive folder ID(s)\n   - HTTP Request or Google Drive Upload (convert to Google Docs)\n   - Google Drive Download (PDF export)\n   - Google Drive Upload (archive PDF)\n   - Google Drive Download (fetch archived file)\n   - Slack Upload (send message with attachment)\n2. **Configure credentials** for OpenAI, Google Drive, and Slack.\n3. **Map output fields**:\n   - `data.markdown` → Google Docs creation\n   - `docId` → PDF export\n   - `fileId` → Slack upload\n4. **Test run** to ensure PDF is generated, archived, and posted to Slack.\n\n## **Requirements**\n- **Credentials**:\n  - OpenAI API key (or compatible LLM provider)\n  - Google Drive (OAuth2) with read/write permissions\n  - Slack bot token with `files:write` permission\n- **Access**:\n  - Write access to target Google Drive folders\n  - Slack bot invited to the target channel\n\n## **How to customize the workflow**\n- **Change the prompt** in the OpenAI Chat Model to generate different types of content (reports, meeting notes, checklists).\n- **Automate triggering**:\n  - Replace Manual Trigger with Cron for scheduled document generation.\n  - Use Webhook Trigger to run on-demand from external apps.\n- **Modify storage logic**:\n  - Save both `.md` and `.pdf` versions in Google Drive.\n  - Use separate folders for drafts vs. final versions.\n- **Enhance distribution**:\n  - Send PDFs to multiple Slack channels or via email.\n  - Integrate with project management tools for automated task creation.",
