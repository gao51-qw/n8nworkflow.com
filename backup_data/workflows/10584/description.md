## Use Cases

### Digital Marketing Agency Example

Agency receives 15-20 proposal requests weekly. Account managers spend 3+ hours per proposal copying templates, updating pricing, and fixing formatting issues. Bottleneck causes delays and lost deals to faster competitors.

**Solution**: Integrates workflow with Pipedrive CRM. When deal moves to "Proposal Requested" stage, webhook triggers. Account manager fills quick form with project scope and pricing. Workflow generates branded proposal in 3 minutes.

**Result**: Proposal sent same day instead of 2-3 days later. Client impressed by speed and professionalism. Close rate increases from 32% to 47%. Agency wins additional $250,000 in annual revenue. Account managers save 40 hours monthly, reallocating time to client strategy.

### SaaS Company Example

Sales team manually creates proposals in Google Docs for enterprise deals. Process takes 4-6 hours per proposal including pricing tables, terms negotiation, and approval routing. Proposals look different depending on who creates them.

**Solution**: Implements workflow connected to HubSpot. When deal reaches "Proposal" stage, workflow auto-generates proposal using deal data. Pricing pulled from HubSpot line items. Manager approval added before sending.

**Result**: Proposal generation time drops to 15 minutes. Brand consistency across all proposals. Sales velocity increases 65%. Deal size grows 23% due to professional presentation building enterprise confidence. Team closes 4 additional enterprise deals worth $180,000 ARR.

### Web Development Studio Example

Studio loses deals because proposal turnaround takes 5-7 days. Prospects receive competing proposals faster and sign before studio's proposal arrives. Revenue growth stalled despite strong pipeline.

**Solution**: Connects workflow to Airtable project intake form. When prospect completes project scope form, workflow instantly generates customized proposal with accurate pricing based on feature selections and complexity.

**Result**: Proposals delivered in under 1 hour versus 5-7 days. Win rate increases from 18% to 41%. Studio captures 8 additional projects monthly worth $35,000. Client satisfaction scores improve as prospects appreciate speed and professionalism.

### IT Consulting Firm Example

Consultants manually assemble proposals from disparate sources including technical specifications, staffing plans, and pricing spreadsheets. Format inconsistencies hurt credibility. Proposal errors cause scope creep and margin erosion.

**Solution**: Builds workflow that pulls technical requirements from project planning tool, staffing from resource management system, and pricing from rate card database. All data flows into validated proposal template.

**Result**: Proposal accuracy increases to 98% reducing change orders and scope disputes. Professional presentation wins 2 competitive bids against larger firms. Margin protection saves $75,000 annually. Proposal creation time reduced from 8 hours to 20 minutes per opportunity.

### Training Company Example

Small team of 4 sends 30+ training proposals monthly. Founder spends 15+ hours weekly on proposal creation instead of business development. Revenue plateaus despite strong demand.

**Solution**: Implements workflow triggered by Typeform submission after discovery calls. Prospects self-select training modules, duration, and delivery format. Workflow generates proposal with accurate pricing and timeline.

**Result**: Founder reclaims 15 hours weekly for strategic activities. Team handles 3x proposal volume without hiring. Revenue increases 140% year-over-year. Client feedback highlights speed and professionalism. Referral rate increases as satisfied clients rave about seamless buying experience.
