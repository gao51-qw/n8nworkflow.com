## ⚡ UPDATE on May 2025 – added section with all n8n instance webhooks

Using n8n a lot?

Soar above the limitations of the default n8n dashboard! This template gives you an overview of your workflows, nodes, and tags – all in one place. 💪

Built using XML stylesheets and the Bootstrap 5 library, this workflow is self-contained and does not depend on any third-party software. 🙌 It generates a comprehensive overview JSON that can be easily integrated with other BI tools for further analysis and visualization. 📊

- **Workflow Details** 🔬: Deep dive into each workflow's nodes, timestamps, and tags.
- **Node Analysis** 🧩: Identify the most frequently used nodes across your workflows.
- **Tag Organization** 🗂️: Workflows are grouped according to their tags.

- **XML & Bootstrap 5** 🛠️: Built using XML stylesheets and Bootstrap 5, ensuring a self-contained and responsive dashboard.
- **No Dependencies** 🔒: The workflow does not rely on any third-party software. Bootstrap 5 files are loaded via CDN but can be delivered directly from your server.

## ⚠️ Important note for cloud users
Since the cloud version doesn't support environmental variables, please make the following changes:

1. **get-nodes-via-jmespath** node. Update the `instance_url` variable: enter your n8n URL instead of `{{$env["N8N_PROTOCOL"]}}://{{$env["N8N_HOST"]}}`
2. **Create HTML** node. Please provide the n8n instance URL instead of `{{ $env.WEBHOOK_URL }}`
