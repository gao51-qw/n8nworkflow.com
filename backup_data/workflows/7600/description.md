This workflow allows you to **search your Outlook mailbox with natural language**. You type what you’re looking for (e.g., “invoice from last week”), and the workflow:  
1. Uses **OpenAI** to generate a search query.  
2. Searches Outlook emails and ranks them by relevance.  
3. Outputs results in a simple table with **score + link** to each email.  

👉 The number of results can be changed (default: **5**).
