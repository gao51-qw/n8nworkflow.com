This automated n8n workflow enables an AI-powered movie recommendation system on WhatsApp. Users send messages like "I want to watch a horror movie" or "Where can I watch the Jumanji movie?" The workflow uses AI to interpret the request, searches relevant APIs (e.g., TMDb, JustWatch), and replies with movie recommendations or streaming platform availability via WhatsApp.

## Fundamental Aspects

- **WhatsApp Webhook Trigger**: Initiates the workflow when a WhatsApp message is received.
- **Analyze WhatsApp Message**: Uses AI (e.g., Ollama Model) to interpret the user's intent and extract request type.
- **Check Request Type**: Determines if the request is for a movie genre or a specific movie title.
- **Check Where Request**: Identifies if the request includes a "where to watch" query.
- **Extract Movie Title**: Extracts the movie title from the message if specified.
- **Extract Genre**: Identifies the movie genre from the message if specified.
- **Search Specific Movie Title**: Queries an API (e.g., TMDb) for details about a specific movie.
- **Search Movies by Genre**: Queries an API (e.g., TMDb) for movies matching the genre.
- **Get Streaming Availability**: Queries an API (e.g., JustWatch) for streaming platforms.
- **Format Streaming Response**: Prepares the response with streaming platform details.
- **Format Genre Recommendations**: Prepares the response with genre-based movie recommendations.
- **Prepare WhatsApp Message**: Formats the final response for WhatsApp.
- **Send WhatsApp Response**: Sends the recommendation or streaming info back to the user via WhatsApp.
