Turn discovery call forms into polished, personalized proposals in seconds. This workflow captures prospect information via Typeform, uses GPT-4 to write compelling proposal content, and automatically creates professional PandaDoc documents with pricing tables.

**Who is this for?**

Freelancers, consultants, agencies, and service businesses who want to:
- Stop spending hours writing proposals manually
- Respond to prospects faster with professional documents
- Maintain consistent proposal quality at scale

**What problem does it solve?**

Writing proposals is time-consuming and inconsistent. This workflow automates the entire process—from form submission to ready-to-send document—while keeping your proposals personalized and professional.

**How it works**

1. Prospect fills out your Typeform discovery questionnaire
2. Workflow validates required fields (email, company name)
3. AI automatically selects the right template based on budget and project complexity
4. GPT-4 writes personalized proposal content tailored to the prospect's challenges
5. GPT-4 generates realistic project milestones
6. PandaDoc creates a professional document with pricing table
7. You receive a Slack notification with a direct link to review

**Template selection logic**

The workflow intelligently routes to the appropriate template:

- **Quick Quote** → Budget under $2,500 AND simple project
- **Standard Proposal** → Budget $2,500+ OR complex project

**What you get**

- Personalized proposal content written by GPT-4
- Challenge summary that shows you understand their pain points
- Specific benefits with metrics (time savings, cost savings)
- 4-phase project timeline with realistic milestones
- Professional PandaDoc document with pricing table
- Slack notifications for successes and errors

**Setup time:** 15-20 minutes

**Setup steps**

1. Add your OpenAI API credential (select in the 3 GPT nodes)
2. Add your Typeform API credential
3. Add your PandaDoc API credential (HTTP Header Auth with your API key)
4. Create a Typeform with discovery questions (see below)
5. Create 2 PandaDoc templates (Quick Quote + Standard Proposal)
6. Update the Config node with your company info and template IDs
7. Add your Slack webhook URL to the Config node

Your discovery form should include these fields:
- What's your company name?
