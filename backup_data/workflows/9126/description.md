## Who’s it for

This workflow is for marketers, influencer agencies, or outreach teams who want to quickly check if a TikTok user meets certain criteria before adding them to an influencer list. No manual profile checking—just drop in a username, and the system does the rest.

## What it does

This workflow takes a TikTok username submitted via form, fetches the user’s profile using **Dumpling AI**, then evaluates the user using **GPT-4** to decide if they qualify for influencer outreach based on predefined rules:

- 40+ videos  
- 100,000+ followers  
- 300,000+ total likes

It then checks Google Sheets:
- If the user **does not exist**, it **adds a new row**
- If the user **already exists**, it **updates the row**

## How it works

1. **Form Trigger**: Collects TikTok username  
2. **Dumpling AI**: Pulls TikTok profile (username, ID, followers, videos, likes, etc.)  
3. **GPT-4**: Checks if the user meets outreach criteria  
4. **Google Sheets**:  
   - Checks if user already exists  
   - Updates or appends user data + qualification status
