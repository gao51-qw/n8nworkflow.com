# Complete Webflow to Pipedrive integration with smart phone formatting

> # Advanced Form Submission to CRM Automation with International Phone Support
## Who's it for
Sales teams, marketing professionals, and business owners who need sophisticated lead management with international phone number support, automated CRM record creation, intelligent duplicate detection, and multi-channel team notifications.
## What it does
This advanced workflow automatically processes form submissions from your website and creates a complete, intelligent CRM structure in Pipedrive. It transforms raw form data into organized sales records including companies, contacts, deals, and relevant notes while handling international phone number formatting and providing real-time team notifications via Discord and WhatsApp messaging.
## How it works
The workflow follows an intelligent automation process with four distinct scenarios:
Form Trigger: Captures form submissions from your website (Webflow in this example)
Advanced Phone Processing: Automatically detects and formats international phone numbers with proper country codes for 20+ countries including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and more
Intelligent CRM Logic: Uses a sophisticated 4-scenario approach:

Scenario A: Existing Organization + Existing Person - Links records and creates new deal
Scenario B: Existing Organization + New Person - Creates person, links to organization, creates deal
Scenario C: New Organization + Existing Person - Creates organization, links person, creates deal
Scenario D: New Organization + New Person - Creates complete new structure from scratch

Enhanced Data Management: Adds lead source tracking, custom properties, and conditional data enhancement
Multi-Channel Communication: Sends formatted alerts to Discord and personalized WhatsApp messages to leads
## Requirements

Webflow account (or any platform that supports webhook triggers)
Pipedrive CRM account with proper API credentials
Team notification service: Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, email service, or any webhook-compatible notification tool
WhatsApp Business API access for lead messaging
International phone number handling capability

## How to set up
### Step 1: Configure your form trigger
Default setup: The template uses Webflow Form Trigger with site ID configuration
Alternative platforms: Replace with webhook trigger for other platforms (WordPress, custom websites, etc.)
Webhook configuration: Set up your website's form to send data to the n8n webhook URL
Form fields: Ensure your form captures the necessary fields:

Prénom (First Name)
Nom (Last Name)
Entreprise (Company)
Mail professionnel (Professional Email)
Téléphone pro (Professional Phone)
URL du site internet (Website URL)
Message

### Step 2: Configure API credentials
Set up the following credentials in n8n:
Webflow OAuth2: For form trigger authentication (or webhook authentication for other platforms)
Pipedrive API: For CRM record creation and management - ensure proper permissions for organizations, persons, deals, and notes
Discord Bot API: For team notifications with guild and channel access
WhatsApp Business API: For automated lead messaging with phone number ID configuration
### Step 3: Customize international phone formatting
The "international dialing code" node automatically handles:
European countries: France (+33), Belgium (+32), Switzerland (+41), Germany (+49), Spain (+34), Italy (+39), Portugal (+351)
North African countries: Morocco (+212), Algeria (+213), Tunisia (+216)
Global coverage: US/Canada (+1), UK (+44), and many Asian countries
Fallback handling: Defaults to French formatting for unrecognized patterns
Error management: Uses +330000000000 as fallback for invalid numbers
### Step 4: Configure Pipedrive settings
Adjust Pipedrive-specific settings in deal creation nodes:
Deal pipeline stage: Currently set to default stage (customize for your pipeline)
Deal ownership: Configure owner_id for appropriate team member assignment
Currency settings: Adjust currency code for your business region
Custom properties: Lead source automatically set to "Growth AI" (customize as needed)
### Step 5: Set up team notifications
Configure your preferred notification system:
Discord (default): Set guild ID: 1377297267014504520, channel ID: 1380469490139009106
Alternative platforms: Replace Discord node with Slack, Teams, email, or custom webhook
Message formatting: Customize notification content and structure
Multi-channel setup: Add multiple notification nodes for different channels
### Step 6: Configure WhatsApp messaging
Set up automated lead engagement:
Phone number ID: Configure WhatsApp Business API phone number (currently: 752773604591912)
Message personalization: Uses prospect's first name and customizable content
International compatibility: Works with formatted international phone numbers
Message templates: Customize welcome messages and follow-up content
## How to customize the workflow
