## 🚦 Workflow Breakdown

1. **Trigger: User Request**
   - Workflow initiates when an authenticated user sends a message in the chat trigger.

2. **AI Agent (Kimi K2 OpenRouter): Intent Analysis**
   - Determines whether the user wants to:
     - List customers, charges, or coupons
     - Retrieve the account’s balance
     - Create a new coupon in Stripe
   - Filters unsupported or unclear requests, explaining permissions or terminology as needed.

3. **Stripe Data Retrieval**
   - For data queries:
     - Only returns summarized, masked lists (e.g., last 10 transactions/customers)
     - Sensitive details, such as card numbers, are automatically masked or truncated
     - Never exposes or logs confidential information

4. **Coupon Creation**
   - When a coupon creation is requested:
     - AI agent collects coupon parameters (discount, expiration, restrictions)
     - Clearly summarizes the action and **requires explicit user confirmation** before proceeding
     - Creates the coupon upon confirmation and replies with only the public-safe coupon details

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- **No data storage:** All responses are ephemeral; sensitive Stripe data is never retained.
- **Strict minimization:** Outputs are tightly scoped; only partial identifiers are shown and only when necessary.
- **Retention rules enforced:** No logs, exports, or secondary storage of Stripe data.
- **Confirmation required:** Actions modifying Stripe (like coupon creation) always require the user to approve before execution.
- **Compliance-ready:** Aligned with Stripe and general data protection standards.
