  "description": "## AI-Powered Viral Video Factory 🚀\n\nThis workflow automates the entire process of creating short, cinematic, fact-based videos ready for social media. It takes a single concept, generates a script and visuals, creates video clips, adds a voiceover, and assembles a final video, which is then uploaded directly to your Google Drive. It's perfect for **content creators and marketing agencies** looking to scale video production with minimal manual effort.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works 🎬\n\n1.  **Generate a Viral Idea** 💡: The workflow begins with the **`Create New Idea1`** (OpenAI) node, which generates a viral-ready video concept, including a punchy title, hashtags, and a brief description based on a core theme (e.g., space, black holes). This idea is then logged in a Google Sheet.\n\n2.  **Create a Cinematic Script & Voiceover** 📜:\n    * An **OpenAI node** (**`Generating scenes1`**) creates a detailed 12-scene script, outlining the visuals for a 60-second video.\n    * The script text for all scenes is combined and prepared for voiceover generation by another **OpenAI node** (**`Generate Voiceover`**).\n\n3.  **Generate Scene-by-Scene Visuals** ✨: The workflow loops through each of the 12 scenes to create an animated clip:\n    * **Image Generation**: An **HTTP Request node** sends the scene's prompt to the **`fal-ai/flux`** model to create a photorealistic still image.\n    * **Animation Prompting**: The **`Video Prompts1`** (OpenAI Vision) node analyzes the generated image and creates a new, specific prompt to animate it cinematically.\n    * **Image-to-Video**: Another **HTTP Request node** uses the **`fal-ai/kling-video`** model to turn the still image into a 5-second animated video clip based on the new animation prompt.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Final Video** 🎞️:\n    * **Stitch Clips**: Once all 12 clips are generated, the **`Merge Clips`** node uses the **`fal-ai/ffmpeg-api`** to concatenate them into a single, seamless 60-second video.\n    * **Add Audio**: The **`Combine Voice and Video`** node then layers the AI-generated voiceover onto the stitched video.\n\n5.  **Deliver to Google Drive** 📂: Finally, the completed video is converted from a URL to a file and automatically uploaded to your specified Google Drive folder for easy access and publishing.\n\n---\n\n## Key Technologies Used\n\n* **n8n**: For orchestrating the entire automated workflow.\n* **OpenAI (GPT-4.1 & GPT-4o)**: For idea generation, scriptwriting, voiceover, and vision analysis.\n* **Fal.ai**: For high-performance, API-based image generation (`Flux`), video animation (`Kling`), and video processing (`FFMPEG API`).\n* **Google Drive & Sheets**: For logging ideas and storing the final video output.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Add Credentials**:\n    * In n8n, add your **OpenAI API key**.\n    * Connect your **Google account** for Google Sheets and Google Drive access.\n    * You will need a **Fal.ai API Key**.\n\n2.  **Configure Fal.ai API Key**:\n    * **Crucially**, you must replace the placeholder API key in all **HTTP Request** nodes that call the `fal.run` URL.\n    * Find the `Authorization` header in each of these nodes and replace the existing key with your own `Key YOUR_FAL_AI_KEY_HERE`.\n    * Nodes to update: `Create Images1`, `Get Images1`, `Create Video1`, `Get Video1`, `Merge Clips`, `Get Final video`, `Combine Voice and Video`.\n\n3.  **Configure OpenAI Nodes**:\n    * Select each OpenAI node (e.g., **`Create New Idea1`**, **`Generating scenes1`**) and choose your OpenAI credential.\n    * You can customize the main prompt in the **`Create New Idea1`** node to change the theme of the videos you want to generate.\n\n4.  **Configure Google Sheets & Drive**:\n    * In the **`Organise idea, caption etc1`** node, select your Google Sheets credential and specify the Spreadsheet and Sheet ID you want to use for logging ideas.\n    * In the **`Upload file to drive`** node, select your Google Drive credential and choose the destination folder for your final videos.",
