![Screen Shot 20250911 at 20.48.18.png](fileId:2357)

This workflow automates the calculation of monthly water bills. Residents can send a photo of their water meter along with their name via Telegram. The workflow uses Gemini AI to extract the meter reading, calculates the usage difference compared to the previous month, and updates a Google Sheet with the billing details. Finally, the workflow sends a summary back via Telegram.
