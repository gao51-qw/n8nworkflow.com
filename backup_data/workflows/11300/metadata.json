  "description": "Who is this for\n- **Space Enthusiasts & Music Lovers**: Discover new music paired with stunning cosmic visuals.\n- **Community Managers**: specific Slack channels with engaging, creative daily content.\n- **n8n Learners**: Learn how to chain Image Analysis (Vision), Logic, and API integrations (Spotify/Slack).\n\n## How it works\n1. **Schedule**: The workflow runs every night at 10 PM.\n2. **Mood Logic**: It checks the day of the week to adjust the energy level (e.g., higher energy for Friday nights, calmer vibes for Mondays).\n3. **Visual Analysis**: **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** analyzes the NASA APOD image to determine its color palette, mood, and subject matter, converting these into musical parameters (Valence, Energy).\n4. **Curation**: **Spotify** searches for a track that matches these specific parameters.\n5. **Creative Writing**: OpenAI generates a short poem or caption linking the image to the song.\n6. **Delivery**: The image, track link, and poem are posted to **Slack**, and the track is automatically saved to a designated **Spotify Playlist**.\n\n## Requirements\n- **NASA API Key** (Free)\n- **OpenAI API Key** (Must have access to GPT-4o model)\n- **Spotify Developer Credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret)\n- **Slack** Workspace and Bot Token\n\n## How to set up\n1. Set up your credentials for NASA, OpenAI, Spotify, and Slack in n8n.\n2. Create a specific Playlist in Spotify and copy its **Playlist ID**.\n3. Copy the **Channel ID** from the Slack channel where you want to post.\n4. Paste these IDs into the respective nodes (marked with `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER__&gt;`) or use the **Set Fields** node to manage them globally.",
