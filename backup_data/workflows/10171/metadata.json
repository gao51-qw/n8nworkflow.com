  "description": "# 🔐 n8n Workflow: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Telegram Automations\nThis n8n workflow lets you control access to your internal Telegram bots and automation systems based on user roles and departments.\nIt ensures that only authorized team members — defined in your employee database — can interact with specific parts of your workflow.\nPerfect for agencies, internal tools, or multi-team organizations where permissions differ across roles (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Administration).\n\n## 📌 Section 1: Trigger & Input\n⚡ Receive Message (Telegram Trigger)\nPurpose: Captures incoming messages from users interacting with your Telegram bot.\n\n### How it works:\nWhen a user sends any message to the bot, the workflow retrieves their Telegram username and triggers the process.\n\n### Benefit:\nProvides a secure and instant entry point for validating user identity before running any internal logic.\n\n## 📌 Section 2: Role Lookup\n📋 Employee Database (Data Table Node)\nPurpose: Fetches user details such as Position and Type from your internal employee table.\n\nStructure Example:\n\nUserName===Position===Type\nUser_1===Marketing===SEO\nUser_2===Administration===Manager\nUser_3===Marketing===Target\n\n### Benefit:\nCentralized employee management — you can update access levels (roles or departments) directly in the data table without editing the workflow.\n\n## 📌 Section 3: Position & Role Check\n### 🧩 Choose Position (Switch Node)\nPurpose: Determines the user’s department or role level (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Administration).\n\n### 🧩 Check Role Type (Switch Node)\nPurpose: Performs a second-level check — filters users by Type (e.g., SEO, SMM, Target).\n\n### Logic:\nMarketing → SEO → Send to SEO workflow branch\nMarketing → Target → Send to Ads branch\nAdministration → Manager → Grant full access\nSales → Employee → Limited access\n\n### Benefit:\nAllows multi-level, role-based logic with different automation paths for each team or position.\n\n## 📌 Section 4: Action Routing\n💬 No Operation Nodes (Placeholders)\nPurpose: Represent different action branches — each can later be replaced with the logic specific to that department.\n\n### Examples:\n“Target” branch → connect to ad performance automation\n“SEO” branch → connect to Google Search Console reports\n“Sales” branch → connect to CRM updates\n\n### Benefit:\nA flexible access framework — ready to integrate with any process per department.\n\n📊 Workflow Overview Table\n\nSection\tNode Name\tPurpose\n1. Trigger\tTelegram Trigger\tCaptures user messages\n2. Lookup\tEmployee Database\tFetches user position and type\n3. Check\tChoose Position / Role Switch\tDefines access path based on role\n4. Routing\tNo Operation Nodes\tSeparate workflows per department\n\n## 🎯 Key Benefits\n\n🔐 Granular Access Control: Multi-level permission logic (Position + Role).\n⚙️ Dynamic Role Management: Update access directly in your data table — no redeployment needed.\n🧱 Modular Design: Add or replace department branches without affecting core logic.\n🚀 Scalable Foundation: Perfect base for enterprise-grade permission systems or multi-team bots.\n📈 Cross-Platform Ready: Can be adapted for Slack, Discord, or internal chat tools.",
