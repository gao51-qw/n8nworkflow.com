  "description": "## Disclaimer\nCommunity nodes are used, and template can only be used on self-hosted n8n instances.\n\n![Upwork workflow.PNG](fileId:2281)\n\n## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for finding relevant Upwork jobs and generating highly-personalized, knowledge-base-driven proposals using AI. \n\nThis workflow acts as an autonomous agent, handling everything from job discovery to drafting the final proposal text, ready for you to review and submit.\n\n## Who's this workflow for?\n- Freelancers & Consultants\n- Digital Agencies\n- Business Development Teams\n- Sales Professionals\n\n## How it works\n**1. Scrape Upwork for New Jobs**: The workflow starts by running an Apify actor to scrape Upwork based on your defined criteria (keywords, categories, payment verification, etc.).\n\n**2. Log Jobs to Google Sheets:** The newly found job opportunities are automatically saved as new rows in a Google Sheet, creating a central dashboard for tracking. A notification is sent confirming the new jobs found.\n\n**3. Trigger AI Proposal Generation:** The workflow then reads the new jobs from the sheet and, for each one that hasn't been applied for, triggers the AI.\n\n**4. Craft a Knowledge-Based Proposal:** It sends the job details to a Google Gemini AI model. The AI uses a detailed, built-in \"Company Knowledge Base\" (which you can customize) to write a comprehensive and relevant proposal. It addresses client questions, highlights relevant experience, and suggests a timeline.\n\n**5. Save the Proposal Draft:** The AI-generated proposal is saved back into the Google Sheet in the corresponding job row.\n\n**6. Final Notification:** A final email is sent to notify you that the proposals are ready, including a link to the sheet for final review and submission on Upwork.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Apify Configuration:**\n- In the Run Upwork Actor... node, connect your Apify account.\n- We have used this apify scrapper- [Upwork Extractor](https://apify.com/jupri/upwork)\n- In the Custom Body field, customize the search parameters (like category, search.any keywords) to match the jobs you are looking for.\n\n**2. Google Gemini AI Configuration:**\n- In the Google Gemini Chat Model node, connect your Google Gemini (PaLM) API account.\n- Crucially: In the Proposal Crafting node, edit the prompt to replace the \"Company Knowledge Base\" with your own company's details, services, and project examples. This is essential for personalizing the proposals.\n\n**3. Google Sheets Setup:**\n- Connect your Google Sheets account.\n- In all three Google Sheets nodes, select your credentials and update the Document ID and Sheet Name to point to your Upwork tracking sheet.\n\n**4. Gmail Configuration:**\n- In both Gmail nodes, connect your account and update the sendTo email address to your own.\n\n**5. Execute the Workflow:**\n- Click \"Execute workflow\" to run the entire job scraping and proposal generation process.\n\n## Key Requirements to Use This Template\n- n8n Instance: An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).\n- Apify Account: An active Apify account with an API key and sufficient credits/subscription to run the \"Upwork Extractor\" actor.\n- Google Account & Sheet: A pre-made Google Sheet with columns for Title, URL, Description, Skills, Questions, Applied, and Proposal Template.\n- Google Gemini AI Account: A Google Cloud account with the Vertex AI API (for Gemini models) enabled and an associated API Key.\n- Gmail Account: A Gmail account to send and receive notifications about the workflow's progress.\n\n## Connect with us\n- Website: https://www.intuz.com/services\n- Email: getstarted@intuz.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuz\n- Get Started: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/intuz\n\n## For Custom Workflow Automation\nClick here- [Get Started](https://www.intuz.com/get-started)",
