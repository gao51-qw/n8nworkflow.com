## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for finding relevant Upwork jobs and generating highly-personalized, knowledge-base-driven proposals using AI. 

This workflow acts as an autonomous agent, handling everything from job discovery to drafting the final proposal text, ready for you to review and submit.

## Who's this workflow for?
- Freelancers & Consultants
- Digital Agencies
- Business Development Teams
- Sales Professionals

## How it works
**1. Scrape Upwork for New Jobs**: The workflow starts by running an Apify actor to scrape Upwork based on your defined criteria (keywords, categories, payment verification, etc.).

**2. Log Jobs to Google Sheets:** The newly found job opportunities are automatically saved as new rows in a Google Sheet, creating a central dashboard for tracking. A notification is sent confirming the new jobs found.

**3. Trigger AI Proposal Generation:** The workflow then reads the new jobs from the sheet and, for each one that hasn't been applied for, triggers the AI.

**4. Craft a Knowledge-Based Proposal:** It sends the job details to a Google Gemini AI model. The AI uses a detailed, built-in "Company Knowledge Base" (which you can customize) to write a comprehensive and relevant proposal. It addresses client questions, highlights relevant experience, and suggests a timeline.

**5. Save the Proposal Draft:** The AI-generated proposal is saved back into the Google Sheet in the corresponding job row.

**6. Final Notification:** A final email is sent to notify you that the proposals are ready, including a link to the sheet for final review and submission on Upwork.

## Setup Instructions
**1. Apify Configuration:**
- In the Run Upwork Actor... node, connect your Apify account.
- We have used this apify scrapper- [Upwork Extractor](https://apify.com/jupri/upwork)
- In the Custom Body field, customize the search parameters (like category, search.any keywords) to match the jobs you are looking for.

**2. Google Gemini AI Configuration:**
- In the Google Gemini Chat Model node, connect your Google Gemini (PaLM) API account.
- Crucially: In the Proposal Crafting node, edit the prompt to replace the "Company Knowledge Base" with your own company's details, services, and project examples. This is essential for personalizing the proposals.

**3. Google Sheets Setup:**
- Connect your Google Sheets account.
- In all three Google Sheets nodes, select your credentials and update the Document ID and Sheet Name to point to your Upwork tracking sheet.

**4. Gmail Configuration:**
- In both Gmail nodes, connect your account and update the sendTo email address to your own.

**5. Execute the Workflow:**
- Click "Execute workflow" to run the entire job scraping and proposal generation process.
