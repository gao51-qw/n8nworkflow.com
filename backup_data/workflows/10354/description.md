## Introduction
Automates travel itinerary creation by searching flights and hotels via APIs, then uses AI to generate personalized recommendations delivered as HTML emails through Gmail.
## How It Works
Webhook receives travel requests, searches Skyscanner and Booking.com APIs in parallel, merges results, uses AI to create optimized itineraries, formats as HTML email, sends via Gmail.
## Workflow Template
Webhook → Parse & Validate → Parallel Searches (Flights: Skyscanner | Hotels: Booking.com) → Merge Data → AI Generate Itinerary → Format HTML Email → Send Gmail → Webhook Response
## Workflow Steps
1. Trigger & Validate: Webhook receives request, extracts destination/dates/budget/preferences, validates data, converts to API parameters.
2. Parallel Search: Skyscanner fetches flights with price/duration/airline. Booking.com retrieves hotels with ratings/pricing. Merge combines both into single JSON object.
3. AI Generation: AI analyzes merged data, evaluates by price/duration/rating, creates itinerary with daily schedule, pairings, costs, and rankings.
4. Delivery: Converts JSON to HTML email with tables and booking links. Gmail sends email. Webhook confirms success.
## Setup Instructions
1. API Configuration: Add Skyscanner and Booking.com API credentials in n8n.
2. Gmail Setup: Configure OAuth2 authentication.
3. Customization: Copy webhook URL, adjust validation rules, modify AI prompts and HTML template.
