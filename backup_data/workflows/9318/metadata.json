  "description": "Get the latest news, from Kagi, with a workflow that lets you filter by news category.\n\nFeed the results in your voice assistant automations to get on-demand news.\n\nOr leverage LLM models to create daily summaries from the headlines you retrieved.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow takes a category name, from the ones available on Kagi News, then uses the Kagi News API to get all of the day's stories in that category. \n\nIt then does a bit of filtering, to make it easier to manipulate. But you can skip or change that to your liking.\n\n## How to use\n\nTo test it, simply change the pinned data in the `Start` node, particularly the `category` field. You can use such examples as `World`, `UK` or `Technology`.\n\nUnsure as to what options for category there are? Just run the workflow and check the output of the `Split Categories` node! It will list all categories available. Take the value from `categoryName`.\n\n## Things to consider\n\nI used `categoryName` as the input instead of `categoryId` for one reason: to make it easier for LLMs to populate that field. \nIf this doesn't work for you, it should be quite easy to change.\n\nIt is also a single category at a time. If you want to get stories from more categories at once, you can take an array as input in `Start`, then filter on the categories list containing your entries, rather than an exact match. Finally, you will have to merge all calls to `Split out stories` after each call to the API.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNone beyond an internet connection for your n8n instance.\n\nThere is no API access token needed or any authorisation of any kind.",
