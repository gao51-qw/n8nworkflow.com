    "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n# ⚙ How It Works\n\nThis workflow operates as an automated personal assistant for your calendar. It listens to your Gmail inbox for new emails. When an email arrives, it checks the subject and body for keywords like \"Meeting\" or \"Appointment.\" If a match is found, the workflow extracts key details from the email and automatically creates a new event on your Google Calendar, eliminating the need for manual data entry.\n\n---\n\n# Setup Steps\n\nFollow these steps to get the workflow running in your n8n instance.\n\n### **1. Prerequisites**\nYou'll need a working n8n instance and access to both your **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** accounts.\n\n### **2. Workflow Import**\nImport the workflow's JSON file into your n8n instance. All the necessary nodes will appear on your canvas.\n\n### **3. Configure Credentials**\n1.  Click on the `Gmail Trigger` node and `Google Calendar` node.\n2.  You will see a red error icon indicating that credentials are not set. Click on it.\n3.  Click **\"Create new credential\"** and follow the instructions to connect your **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** accounts.\n\n### **4. Customize the `If` Node**\nThis node determines which emails will trigger a calendar event.\n1.  Click on the `If` node.\n2.  Review the `Value 2` field under the conditions. This is where you specify the keywords that should trigger an event.\n3.  You can add more keywords by clicking **\"Add Condition\"** and using the `OR` operator (e.g., add `call`, `interview`, or `demo`).\n\n### **5. Customize the `Code` Node**\nThis node extracts the event details from your email. The current code is a basic example using regular expressions to find a date and time.\n1.  Click on the `Code` node.\n2.  Review the code. You may need to adjust the regular expressions if your emails have a different format for dates and times.\n3.  The node will output a JSON object containing the `title`, `date`, and `time` that will be used to create your calendar event.\n\n### **6. Configure the `Google Calendar` Node**\nThis is the final node that creates the event.\n1.  Click on the `Google Calendar` node.\n2.  In the `Calendar ID` field, enter the ID of the specific calendar you want the events to be created on. You can find this in your Google Calendar settings.\n\n### **7. Activate the Workflow**\n1.  Once all credentials and node configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Finally, toggle the workflow to **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically schedule events for you.",

            "content": "# Workflow Note: Automated Event Scheduling from Emails\n\n---\n\n### **Problem**\nManually creating calendar events from emails is a tedious and time-consuming task. Busy professionals often spend several minutes a day copying details like the event title, date, and time from their inbox to their calendar. This repetitive manual work is inefficient and increases the risk of human error, potentially leading to missed appointments and scheduling conflicts.\n\n### **Solution**\nThis is a simple but highly effective n8n workflow that automates the process of creating calendar events from your emails. By using keyword-based triggers and basic data extraction, the system automatically creates new events on your Google Calendar, eliminating the need for manual input and ensuring your schedule is always up-to-date.\n\n### **For Whom**\nThis workflow is perfect for **busy professionals, project managers, and anyone who receives event invitations via email**. It is a great starting point for those new to automation and looking to streamline their daily administrative tasks without a complex setup.\n\n### **Scope**\n* **What it includes:**\n    * Automatically monitors your Gmail inbox for new emails.\n    * Uses an `If` node to check for specified keywords (e.g., \"Meeting\", \"Appointment\") in the email's subject or body.\n    * A `Code` node to extract key details like the event title and a potential date/time.\n    * The creation of a new event on a specified Google Calendar.\n\n* **What it excludes:**\n    * Advanced natural language processing (NLP) to understand complex event details.\n    * Integration with other calendar or project management tools.\n    * Handling of emails that do not contain clear date and time information.\n\n### **How to Set Up**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need an n8n instance and accounts for both **Gmail** and **Google Calendar**.\n2.  **Workflow Import:** Import the workflow's `.json` file into your n8n instance. All the necessary nodes will appear on your canvas.\n3.  **Credential Configuration:**\n    * Click on the `Gmail Trigger` and `Google Calendar` nodes.\n    * Follow the on-screen instructions to create and connect your **Gmail** and **Google Calendar** credentials.\n4.  **Node-Specific Configuration:**\n    * **`Gmail Trigger`:** Ensure the `Folder` parameter is set to `Inbox` to watch for all new incoming emails.\n    * **`If` Node:** Customize the keywords in this node to match the terms you typically see in your event-related emails (e.g., \"call,\" \"demo,\" \"interview,\" etc.).\n    * **`Google Calendar` Node:** In the `Calendar ID` field, enter the ID of the calendar where you want the new events to be created.\n5.  **Activation:** Once all credentials and node configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas and then toggle the workflow to **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically schedule events for you."
