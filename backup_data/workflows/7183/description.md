# Who’s it for
This workflow is ideal for marketing teams, growth analysts, and business owners who need regular Google Analytics insights without manually digging through data. It’s also perfect for organizations that want to ensure positive performance updates reach stakeholders quickly while negative trends get immediate attention from the internal team.

# How it works / What it does
The workflow runs weekly on a set schedule, pulls key performance metrics from Google Analytics, and aggregates the data into a clean summary.
An AI Agent (powered by Google Gemini and connected to Simple Memory for historical context) analyzes the data, generates actionable insights, and classifies the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- Positive sentiment → Automatically emailed to stakeholders via Gmail.
- Negative sentiment → Sent instantly to a designated Telegram group for faster response.

This ensures wins are celebrated, and issues are addressed promptly.
