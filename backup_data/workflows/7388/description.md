**Automatically create Intercom conversations with full technical context when your team receive new Marker.io issues**

## 🎯 What this template does

This workflow creates a seamless bridge between Marker.io and Intercom, your customer support platform. Every issue submitted through Marker.io's widget automatically becomes a trackable conversation in Intercom, complete with technical details and visual context. Centralizing customers issues in Intercom helps your support agents continue the conversation right where they work every day.

When a bug is reported, the workflow:
- Creates or updates the reporter as an Intercom contact
- Opens a new conversation with the reporter and the all issue details
- Adds a comprehensive internal note with technical metadata
- Preserves all screenshots, browser info, and custom data

## ✨ Benefits

- **Zero manual entry** - All bug details transfer automatically
- **Instant visibility** - Support agents sees issues immediately  
- **Rich context** - Technical details preserved for developers
- **Better collaboration** - Single source of truth for bugs
- **Faster resolution** - No time wasted gathering information

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Product Teams**: Streamline bug triage without switching tools
- **Support Teams**: Get technical context for customer-reported issues
- **Development Teams**: Access browser info, console logs and network logs directly from the support tickets

## 🔧 How it works

1. **n8n Webhook receives** Marker.io bug report data
2. **Format and extract** relevant information from the payload
3. **Create/update contact** in Intercom with reporter details
4. **Start conversation** with the Title and Bug description
5. **Add internal note** with full technical context and Marker.io links for the support agent

The result is a perfectly organized support ticket that your team can act on immediately, with all the context they need to reproduce and resolve the issue.
