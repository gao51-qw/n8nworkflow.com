How This Works
-
This automation automatically scrapes leads from Apollo using the Apify scraper, filters out those who do not have an Email or URL included, scrapes the leads' website content and writes personalised Icebreakers and subject lines based on the website's content.

Set Up (Step-by-Step)
-
- Connect the API keys from the Apify scraper mentioned in the workflow sticky note.
- Insert Apollo URL and the amount of leads you want to scrape.
- Connect your Slack account (if needed)
