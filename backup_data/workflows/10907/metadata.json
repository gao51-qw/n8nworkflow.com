  "description": "## Who's it for\n\nCustomer support teams, sales representatives, and international business professionals who need to handle multilingual email communication efficiently while maintaining quality control through human approval.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow automates email responses by:\n1. **Monitoring Gmail** for emails with a specific label (e.g., \"To_Process\")\n2. **Translating** the email content using DeepL to your preferred language\n3. **Generating** an AI-powered summary and draft reply using OpenAI\n4. **Requesting approval** via Slack with a summary and one-click approval link\n5. **Sending the reply** only after human approval is received\n6. **Removing the label** to prevent reprocessing\n\n## Set up steps\n\nSetup takes approximately 15-20 minutes:\n1. Configure credentials for Gmail, DeepL, OpenAI, and Slack\n2. Create a Gmail label for emails to process\n3. Update the Slack channel ID in the configuration node\n4. Ensure n8n is accessible via webhook (tunnel or production mode required)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Gmail account with OAuth2 authentication\n- DeepL API key (free tier available)\n- OpenAI API key\n- Slack workspace with OAuth2 app configured\n- n8n instance accessible via webhook URL\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Change translation language**: Modify the DeepL node's target language\n- **Adjust AI model**: Switch between GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 in the OpenAI node\n- **Customize approval message**: Edit the Slack message format\n- **Add multiple languages**: Duplicate the translation node for multi-language support\n- **Filter specific senders**: Add conditions to process only certain email addresses",
