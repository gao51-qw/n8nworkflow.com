  "title": "Provide real-time updates for Notion databases via webhooks with Supabase",
  "description": "## Purpose\n\nThis enables webhooks for nearly realtime updates (every 5 seconds) from Notion Databases.\n\n## Problem\n\nNotion does not offer webhooks. Even worse, the “Last edited time” property, we could use for polling, only updates every minute. This gives us a polling interval only as low as 2 minutes and we still need to implement a comparing mechanism to detect changes.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis workflow caches states in between while doing efficient polling & comparing. It brings down the update latency from 2 minutes to 5 seconds and also provides the output of the changes only.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![Get real-time updates from Notion Databases](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BROsXafy9Uw/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BROsXafy9Uw)\n\n## How it works\n\n- Database Pages are frequently polled while filtered by a last modified time stamp for more efficiency\n- Retrieved pages get compared with previously cached versions in Supabase\n- Only new and changed pages are pushed to a registered webhook\n\n## Setup\n\n- Create a new project in Supabase and import the DB schema (provided through Gumroad)\n- Add a \"Last edited time\" property to your Notion Database, if it has none yet\n- Define the dynamically generated settings_id from the settings table (Supabase) in the Globals node\n- Define the Notion Database URL in the Globals node\n- Define your custom Webhook URL in the last node where the results should be pushed to\n- It is recommended to call this workflow using [this](https://n8n.io/workflows/2270-prevent-simultaneous-workflow-executions-with-redis/) template to prevent simultaneous workflow executions\n- Set the Schedule Trigger to every 5 seconds or less frequent\n- More detailed instructions provided within the workflow file and the illustrated instructions provided during the download\n\n## Example output\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"action\": \"changed\",\n    \"changes\": {\n      \"property_modified_at\": \"2024-06-04T17:59:00.000Z\",\n      \"property_priority\": \"important\"\n    },\n    \"data\": {\n      \"id\": \"ba761e03-7d6d-44c2-8e8d-c8a4fb930d0f\",\n      \"name\": \"Try out n8n\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.notion.so/Try-out-n8n-ba761e037d6d44c28e8dc8a4fb930d0f\",\n      \"property_todoist_id\": \"\",\n      \"property_id\": \"ba761e037d6d44c28e8dc8a4fb930d0f\",\n      \"property_modified_at\": \"2024-06-04T17:59:00.000Z\",\n      \"property_status\": \"Backlog\",\n      \"property_priority\": \"important\",\n      \"property_due\": {\n        \"start\": \"2024-06-05\",\n        \"end\": null,\n        \"time_zone\": null\n      },\n      \"property_focus\": false,\n      \"property_name\": \"Try out n8n\"\n    },\n    \"updated_at\": \"2024-06-04T17:59:42.144+00:00\"\n  }\n]\n```\n",
