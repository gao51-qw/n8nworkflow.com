## Purpose

This enables webhooks for nearly realtime updates (every 5 seconds) from Notion Databases.

## Problem

Notion does not offer webhooks. Even worse, the “Last edited time” property, we could use for polling, only updates every minute. This gives us a polling interval only as low as 2 minutes and we still need to implement a comparing mechanism to detect changes.

## Solution

This workflow caches states in between while doing efficient polling & comparing. It brings down the update latency from 2 minutes to 5 seconds and also provides the output of the changes only.

## Demo

[![Get real-time updates from Notion Databases](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BROsXafy9Uw/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BROsXafy9Uw)

## How it works

- Database Pages are frequently polled while filtered by a last modified time stamp for more efficiency
- Retrieved pages get compared with previously cached versions in Supabase
- Only new and changed pages are pushed to a registered webhook

## Setup

- Create a new project in Supabase and import the DB schema (provided through Gumroad)
- Add a "Last edited time" property to your Notion Database, if it has none yet
- Define the dynamically generated settings_id from the settings table (Supabase) in the Globals node
- Define the Notion Database URL in the Globals node
- Define your custom Webhook URL in the last node where the results should be pushed to
- It is recommended to call this workflow using [this](https://n8n.io/workflows/2270-prevent-simultaneous-workflow-executions-with-redis/) template to prevent simultaneous workflow executions
- Set the Schedule Trigger to every 5 seconds or less frequent
- More detailed instructions provided within the workflow file and the illustrated instructions provided during the download
