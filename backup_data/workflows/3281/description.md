This n8n template demonstrates how to download multiple PDF files from public URLs and merge them into a single PDF using the PDF Toolkit from [www.customjs.space](https://www.customjs.space).

[@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit)

## What this workflow does

- **Defines** an array of PDF URLs.
- **Splits** the array to process each URL individually.
- **Downloads** each PDF using an HTTP Request.
- **Merges** all downloaded PDFs using the Merge PDF node from the @custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit.
- **Writes** the final merged PDF to disk.

### Design workflow

- A Manual Trigger for starting workflow.
- A code node that returns URLs of PDF files as an array
- Split Out node for concurrent processing
- HTTP node for downloading PDF file locally
- Merge PDFs node for merging files
- Write to Disk node for saving merged PDF file.

You can replace logic for triggering and returning results.
For example, you can trigger this workflow by calling a webhook and get a result as a response from webhook. Simply replace Manual Trigger and Write to Disk nodes.

## Perfect for

- Bundling reports or invoices.
- Generating document sets from external sources.
- Automating PDF handling without writing custom code.
