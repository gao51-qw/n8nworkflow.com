  "description": "Stop wasting time on video editing! This template is designed for **content creators and marketers** who need a fast, scalable way to convert simple text scripts into polished, shareable AI-generated videos and publish them automatically to Instagram. The workflow includes a critical human review step to maintain quality control.\n\n### **Prerequisites**\n\nTo use this template, you must have the following:\n\n* An active n8n instance.\n* An **active Blotato account** (required for the AI video generation and Instagram upload API access).\n* The **Blotato n8n node** must be installed on your n8n instance.\n* A configured **Gmail** node to handle the human approval step.\n\n### **How It Works (Workflow Breakdown)**\n\nThis automation efficiently moves your content from a text script to a live Instagram post:\n\n1.  **Script Input (`Form` Node):**\n    * The workflow starts by accepting your script via a simple form input.\n2.  **Data Structuring (`Information Extractor` Node):**\n    * The raw script is processed to arrange the information into a specific JSON schema, ensuring the **Blotato Create Content** node receives the correct input format required for AI video generation.\n3.  **AI Video Generation (`Blotato` Node):**\n    * The process triggers the **Blotato AI video generation**. This process is set to run in a *Queue* mode.\n4.  **Status Check Loop (`Loop`, `Wait`, `IF` Nodes):**\n    * Since video generation takes time, the workflow enters a loop:\n        * It uses a **Wait** node to pause for 80 seconds.\n        * It then uses the **Blotato Get Video** node, combined with an **IF** node, to check the generation status.\n        * This loop continues until the video is fully generated.\n5.  **Human Approval (`Gmail` Node):**\n    * Once the video is generated, the hosted video link is sent to your Gmail. The email includes two interactive buttons: \"Approve\" and \"Disapprove.\"\n6.  **Instagram Upload (`Blotato` Node):**\n    * If you choose to \"Approve\" the video, the final step uses the **Blotato** node to automatically upload the finished video as an Instagram Reel.\n\n### **Setup Instructions**\n\n* **Template Download:** The full, free template is available here: [Template JSON](https://github.com/MrKarne/youtube/blob/main/Blotato-Instagram-reel-automation.json)\n* **Configuration Tutorial:** For a visual, step-by-step guide on configuring the Blotato node and setting up the workflow, please watch the full tutorial: [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4UL1GrW09O0)\n* It takes 10 mins to configure the Workflow",
