### This n8n flow demos basic dev-ops operation task, dns records management. 

**AI agent** with light and basic prompt functions like `getter` and `setter` for DNS records. 

In this special case, we are managing remote dns server, via **API calls** - that are handled on **CloudFlare** platform side.

Use-cases for this flow can be standalone, or you can chain it in your pipe-line to get powerful infrastructure flows for your needs.

## How it works

- we created basic agent and gave it a prompt to know about one tool: cf_tool - sub-routine (to itself flow - or it can be separate dedicated one)
- prompt have defined arguments that are needed for passing them when calling agent, for each action specifically
- tool it self have basic if switch that is - based of a action call - calling specific CloudFlare API endpoint (and pass down the args from the tool)

### Requirements

For storing and processing of data in this flow you will need:

- CloudFlare.com API key/token - for retrieving your data (https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/api-tokens)
- OpenAPI credentials (or any other LLM provider) saved - for agent chat
- (Optional) PostGres table for chat history saving
