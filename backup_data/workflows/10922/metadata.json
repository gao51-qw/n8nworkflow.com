  "description": "## Overview\nThis workflow, \"Mood Graph Studio,\" offers a comprehensive solution to track and visualize your emotional well-being. By simply inputting a single sentence about your mood, this template uses AI to perform a sentiment analysis, generates a visual graph via Wolfram Alpha, provides personalized feedback, and logs everything to Google Sheets.\n\nIt is designed for anyone interested in mindfulness, self-reflection, or quantified self-tracking.\n\n## How It Works\nThe workflow is divided into two main API functionalities and a manual trigger for easy testing.\n\n1. **Analyze a Single Mood (`/mood` endpoint)**\n- An AI Agent (OpenAI) quantifies your mood text into `valence` (positivity) and `energy` (activity).\n- A query is sent to **Wolfram Alpha** to generate a simple linear graph based on the score.\n- A second AI Agent provides short, encouraging advice in Japanese.\n- The complete entry is logged as a new row in **Google Sheets**.\n- Returns a JSON response containing the full analysis and the graph image.\n\n2. **Generate Mood History Graph (`/history` endpoint)**\n- Retrieves historical mood data for a specified user from Google Sheets.\n- A Code node formats the data into a time-series plot query.\n- **Wolfram Alpha** generates a line graph visualizing the mood trend over time.\n- The resulting graph is automatically posted to **Slack**.\n\n## How to Set Up\n\n### 1. Credentials\nYou must add your own credentials for the following services in the respective nodes:\n- **OpenAI**: Used in both Chat Model nodes.\n- **Google Sheets**: Used in the \"Log Mood\" and \"Get History\" nodes.\n- **Slack**: Used in the \"Send History\" node.\n\n### 2. Wolfram Alpha App ID\nThis workflow uses the HTTP Request node to call the Wolfram Alpha API.\n- Get a free App ID from the [Wolfram|Alpha Developer Portal](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/index.html).\n- Paste your App ID into the `appid` parameter value in both `Generate...Graph` nodes.\n\n### 3. Google Sheet Configuration\n- Create a new Google Sheet.\n- Paste the **Sheet ID** into the `Document ID` field in both Google Sheets nodes.\n- **Crucially**, ensure the first row has the following headers exactly (case-sensitive):\n`userId`, `moodText`, `valence`, `energy`, `createdAt`, `wolframQuery`, `feedback`\n\n## How to Use\n\n**For Testing:**\nUse the **Manual Trigger**. Modify the sample text in the \"Set Test Data\" node and click \"Execute Workflow\" on the canvas.\n\n**For Production:**\nActivate the workflow. Send POST requests to the Production URL of the Webhook nodes.",
