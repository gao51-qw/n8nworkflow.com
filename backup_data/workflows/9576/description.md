### How it Works

This workflow automates the entire process of generating AI videos and publishing them to YouTube, using a Google Sheet as the central control panel.

1.  **Trigger & Data Fetch:** The workflow is triggered either manually or on a schedule. It starts by reading a specific Google Sheet to find new video requests. A new request is identified as a row where the "PROMPT" and "DURATION" columns are filled, but the "VIDEO" column is empty.
2.  **AI Video Generation:** For each new request, it takes the prompt and duration, then sends a request to the **Fal.ai Sora-2 Pro** model via its API to generate the video. The system then enters a polling loop, checking the video generation status every 60 seconds until it is `COMPLETED`.
3.  **Post-Processing & Upload:** Once the video is ready, the workflow performs three parallel actions:
    *   **Fetch Video & Upload to Drive:** It retrieves the generated video file and uploads it to a specified folder in Google Drive for archiving.
    *   **Generate YouTube Title:** It sends the original prompt to **OpenAI's GPT-5** (or another specified model) to generate an optimized, SEO-friendly title for the YouTube video.
    *   **Publish to YouTube:** It takes the generated video file and the AI-created title and uses the **Upload-Post.com** service to automatically publish the video to a connected YouTube channel.
4.  **Update & Log:** Finally, the workflow updates the original Google Sheet row with the URL of the archived video in Google Drive and the newly created YouTube video URL, providing a complete audit trail.

### Set up Steps

To configure this workflow, follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare the Google Sheet:**
    *   Create a Google Sheet with at least these columns: `PROMPT`, `DURATION`, `VIDEO`, and `YOUTUBE_URL`.
    *   In the n8n "Get new video" and update nodes, configure the `documentId` and `sheetName` to point to your specific Google Sheet.

2.  **Configure Fal.ai API Key:**
    *   Create an account on [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain your API key.
    *   In both the "Create Video" and "Get status" HTTP Request nodes, set up the HTTP Header Authentication.
    *   Set the `Name` to `Authorization` and the `Value` to `Key YOUR_API_KEY`.

3.  **Set up Upload-Post.com for YouTube:**
    *   Create an account on [Upload-Post.com](https://www.upload-post.com/) and get your API key. Connect your YouTube channel as a "profile".
    *   In the "HTTP Request" node (for uploading), configure the Header Auth with `Name: Authorization` and `Value: Apikey YOUR_UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY`.
    *   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in the node's body parameters with the profile name you created on Upload-Post.com (e.g., `test1`).

4.  **Configure OpenAI (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   The "Generate title" node uses an OpenAI model. Ensure you have valid OpenAI API credentials set up in n8n for this node to function and create optimized titles.

5.  **Finalize Paths and Activate:**
    *   In the "Upload Video" node, specify the correct Google Drive folder ID where you want the videos to be saved.
    *   Once all credentials and paths are set, you can activate the workflow and set the "Schedule Trigger" node to run at your desired interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).
