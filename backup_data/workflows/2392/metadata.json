  "description": "## What this template does\nThis template serves as a Chatbot that enables you to ask questions about the content of a PDF directly in Telegream.\n\nIt checks incoming Telegram messages if they contain a document. If they do, it stores the PDF in a Pinecone Vector store. If there's no document, it will search the Vector Store for information and try to answer your question.\n\n## Setup\n1. Open the Telegram app and search for the BotFather user (@BotFather) \n2. Start a chat with the BotFather \n3. Type /newbot to create a new bot \n4. Follow the prompts to name your bot and get a unique API token \n5. Save your access token and username\nOnce you set your bot, you can send the pdf, and then ask questions about the content.\n\n## How to adjust it to your needs\n- You can exchange the Groq chat model with any model that you like\n- Exchange Pinecone with any other vector store tool you like (e.g. Supabase, Postgres or QDrant)\n\n#Telegram, #Pinecone, #Openai, #GroQ",
