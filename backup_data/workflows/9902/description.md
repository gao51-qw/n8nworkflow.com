## How it Works

This workflow automates the entire lead qualification process from form submission to personalized follow-up. When a prospect fills out your [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com/), the workflow instantly captures their information, runs it through an intelligent scoring algorithm that evaluates email domain, company size, budget, and timeline to assign a lead score (0-100 points). Based on the score, leads are automatically categorized as Hot (75+), Warm (50-74), or Cold (0-49) and routed accordingly.

Hot leads trigger immediate notifications to your sales team via [Slack](https://slack.com/) with full contact details and qualification notes, while warm and cold leads are routed to marketing for nurture campaigns. All leads are simultaneously logged to HubSpot CRM with custom properties and Google Sheets for tracking and reporting. The workflow then generates personalized follow-up emails based on the lead tier—urgent, action-oriented messages for hot leads and educational, resource-focused content for others—and sends them automatically via SMTP.

The entire process takes seconds from form submission to follow-up, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring no lead falls through the cracks.

## Customization Guidance

- **Scoring Algorithm:** Adjust point values for email domain (25), company size (30), budget (25), and timeline (20) in the AI Lead Scoring node based on your priorities.
- **Lead Tier Thresholds:** Modify the 75-point hot lead threshold and 50-point warm lead threshold to match your lead quality distribution.
- **Email Templates:** Edit the JavaScript in the Generate Personalized Email node to include your calendar links, case studies, and value propositions.
- **Field Mapping:** Update the Extract & Format Lead Data node if your JotForm uses different field names.
- **CRM Customization:** Replace HubSpot with Salesforce, Pipedrive, or any other CRM that n8n supports.
- **Notification Channels:** Add additional Slack channels, Microsoft Teams, or SMS notifications via Twilio for different routing scenarios.
- **Additional Enrichment:** Insert data enrichment nodes (Clearbit, Hunter.io) between scoring and CRM creation for enhanced lead profiles.
