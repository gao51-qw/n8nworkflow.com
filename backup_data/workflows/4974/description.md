# What problem does it solve?
Finding viral content ideas and writing engaging threads is time-consuming and hit-or-miss. This workflow automates the entire process: discovers high-performing YouTube videos based on your keywords, extracts key insights using AI, and generates multiple viral thread variations using proven patterns from 12.5M+ view threads.

# How it works

| # | Node | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **Form Trigger** | Captures your keyword, target audience, and content type preferences. |
| 2 | **YouTube Video Search** | Finds recent videos (April 2025+) matching your keyword, sorted by view count. |
| 3 | **Get Video Statistics** | Fetches detailed metrics (views, engagement) for discovered videos. |
| 4 | **Filter High-Performers** | Keeps only videos with 100K+ views and excludes YouTube Shorts. |
| 5 | **Top 5 Selection** | Limits to the best 2 videos to focus on proven winners. |
| 6 | **Save Video Candidates** | Logs discovered videos to Google Sheets for manual approval. |
| 7 | **Wait & Check Approval** | Pauses 30 seconds, then checks which videos you marked "Yes" for thread generation. |
| 8 | **Video Analysis (Gemini)** | Uses Google's Gemini AI to extract key insights, tools, and strategies from approved videos. |
| 9 | **Thread Generation (Claude)** | Applies viral thread database patterns to create 3 distinct thread variations using Claude Sonnet 4. |
| 10 | **Structure & Save Threads** | Formats the generated threads and saves them back to Google Sheets for review and posting. |
