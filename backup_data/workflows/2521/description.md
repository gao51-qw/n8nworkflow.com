## Purpose

This workflow allows you to transfer credentials from one n8n instance to another.

## How it works

- A multi-form setup guides you through the entire process
- You get to choose one of your predefined (in the Settings node) remote instances first
- Then all credentials of the current instance are being retrieved using the Execute Command node
- On the next form page you can select one of the credentials by their name and initiate the transfer
- Finally the credential is being created on the remote instance using the n8n API. A final form ending indicates if that action succeeded or not.

## Setup

- Select your credentials in the nodes which require those
- Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node
    - Every instance is defined as object with the keys *name*, *apiKey* and *baseUrl*. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas.

## How to use

- Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node
- Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form

## Disclaimer

- Please note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the Execute Command Node.
- Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow.
- This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments. For production use consider the n8n enterprise edition which provides a **reliable** way to manage credentials across different environments.
