This workflow is designed for creators, marketers, and agencies who want to automate content publishing while keeping quality control through human review. It integrates four powerful tools — **Google Sheets**, **OpenAI**, **GoToHuman**, and **Blotato** — to deliver a seamless AI-assisted, human-approved, auto-publishing system for LinkedIn.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does

1. **📅 Pulls Today’s Topic from Google Sheets**  
   - You store ideas in a spreadsheet with a date column.  
   - The workflow runs daily (or manually) and selects the row matching today’s date.

2. **🧠 Generates a Caption with OpenAI**  
   - The selected idea is passed to GPT-4 via an AI Agent node.  
   - OpenAI returns a short, emoji-rich LinkedIn caption (1–2 sentences).  
   - The result is saved back to the sheet.

3. **👤 Sends the Caption for Human Review via GoToHuman**  
   - A human reviewer sees the AI-generated caption.  
   - They approve or reject it using a GoToHuman review template.  
   - Only approved captions move forward.

4. **🚀 Publishes the Approved Caption to LinkedIn via Blotato**  
   - The caption is posted to a LinkedIn account via Blotato's API.  
   - No additional input is required — it's fully automated after approval.
