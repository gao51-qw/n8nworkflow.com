  "description": "# Marker.io to ServiceNow Integration\n**Automatically create ServiceNow incidents with full technical context when bugs are reported through Marker.io**\n\n## 🎯 What this template does\nThis workflow creates a seamless bridge between Marker.io and ServiceNow, your IT service management platform. Every issue submitted through Marker.io's widget automatically becomes a trackable incident in ServiceNow, complete with technical details and visual context. This ensures your IT team can track, prioritize, and resolve bugs efficiently within their existing ITSM workflow.\n\nWhen a bug is reported, the workflow:\n- Captures the complete Marker.io webhook payload\n- Formats all technical details and metadata\n- Creates a new incident in ServiceNow with the reporter information\n- Includes comprehensive technical context and Marker.io links\n- Preserves screenshots, browser info, and custom data\n\n## ✨ Benefits\n- **Automated ticket creation** - No manual data entry required\n- **Complete context** - All bug details transfer automatically\n- **Faster triage** - IT teams see issues immediately in ServiceNow\n- **Better tracking** - Leverage ServiceNow's incident management capabilities\n- **Rich debugging info** - Browser, OS, and screenshot details preserved\n\n## 💡 Use Cases\n- **IT Service Desks**: Streamline bug reporting from end users\n- **Development Teams**: Track production issues with full technical context\n- **QA Teams**: Convert test findings directly into trackable incidents\n- **Support Teams**: Escalate customer-reported bugs to IT with complete details\n\n## 🔧 How it works\n1. **N8N Webhook receives** Marker.io bug report data\n2. **JavaScript node formats** and extracts relevant information\n3. **ServiceNow node creates** incident with formatted details\n4. **Incident includes** title, description, reporter info, and technical metadata\n5. **Links preserved** to both public and private Marker.io views\n\nThe result is a fully documented ServiceNow incident that your IT team can immediately action, with all the context needed to reproduce and resolve the issue.\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n- **Marker.io account** with webhook capabilities\n- **ServiceNow instance** with API access enabled\n- **ServiceNow credentials** (username/password or OAuth)\n- **Appropriate ServiceNow permissions** to create incidents\n\n## 🚀 Setup Instructions\n1. **Import this workflow** into your n8n instance\n2. **Configure the Webhook**:\n   - Copy the production webhook URL after saving\n   - Add to Marker.io: Workspace Settings → Webhooks → Create webhook\n   - Select \"Issue Created\" as the trigger event\n3. **Set up ServiceNow credentials**:\n   - In n8n, create new ServiceNow credentials\n   - Enter your ServiceNow instance URL\n   - Add username and password for a service account\n   - Test the connection\n4. **Customize field mappings** (optional):\n   - Modify the JavaScript code to map additional fields\n   - Adjust priority mappings to match your ServiceNow setup\n   - Add custom field mappings as needed\n5. **Test the integration**:\n   - Create a test issue in Marker.io\n   - Verify the incident appears in ServiceNow\n   - Check that all data transfers correctly\n\n## 📊 Data Captured\n### ServiceNow Incident includes:\n- **Short Description**: Issue title from Marker.io\n- **Description** containing:\n  - 🐛 Issue title and ID\n  - 📊 Priority level and issue type\n  - 📅 Due date (if set)\n  - 📝 Full issue description\n  - 🖥️ Browser version and details\n  - 💻 Operating system information\n  - 🌐 Website URL where issue occurred\n  - 🔗 Direct links to Marker.io issue (public and private)\n  - 📦 Any custom data fields\n  - 📷 Screenshot URL with proper formatting\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Components\n- **Webhook Node**: Receives Marker.io POST requests\n- **Code Node**: Processes and formats the data using JavaScript\n- **ServiceNow Node**: Creates the incident using ServiceNow API\n\n[→ Read more about Marker.io webhook events](https://help.marker.io/en/articles/3738778-webhook-notifications)\n\n## 🚨 Troubleshooting\n\n**Webhook not triggering:**\n- Verify webhook URL is correctly copied from n8n to Marker.io\n- Check that \"Issue Created\" event is selected in Marker.io webhook settings\n- Ensure webhook is set to \"Active\" status in Marker.io\n- Test with Marker.io's webhook tester feature\n- Check n8n workflow is active and not in testing mode\n\n**ServiceNow incident not created:**\n- Verify ServiceNow credentials are correct and have not expired\n- Check that the service account has permissions to create incidents\n- Ensure ServiceNow instance URL is correct (include https://)\n- Test ServiceNow connection directly in n8n credentials settings\n- Check ServiceNow API rate limits haven't been exceeded\n\n**Missing or incorrect data:**\n- Screenshot URL broken: The workflow already handles URL formatting, but verify Marker.io is generating screenshots\n- Custom data missing: Ensure custom fields exist in Marker.io before sending\n- Due date formatting issues: Check your ServiceNow date format requirements\n\n**JavaScript errors in Format node:**\n- Check webhook payload structure hasn't changed in Marker.io updates\n- Verify all field paths match current Marker.io webhook schema\n- Use n8n's data pinning to debug with actual webhook data\n- Check for undefined values when optional fields are missing\n\n**Connection issues:**\n- ServiceNow timeout: Increase timeout in node settings if needed\n- SSL/Certificate errors: Check ServiceNow instance SSL configuration\n- Network restrictions: Ensure n8n can reach your ServiceNow instance\n- Authentication failures: Regenerate ServiceNow credentials if needed\n\n**Testing tips:**\n- Use n8n's \"Execute Workflow\" with pinned test data\n- Enable webhook test mode in Marker.io for safe testing\n- Check ServiceNow incident logs for detailed error messages\n- Monitor n8n execution logs for specific failure points",
