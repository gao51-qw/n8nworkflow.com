## Overview

- This workflow is an **AI-powered Salon Booking Assistant** that automates hair, beauty, and spa appointment scheduling through a **Webhook trigger**.  
- It interacts with the user in natural conversation, collects booking details (service type, stylist preference, date/time, and any special requests), finalizes the draft, and confirms the appointment by storing it in **Google Calendar** and sending an **email confirmation** — fully automated end-to-end.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
- The workflow starts when a user submits a request via the **Webhook**.  
- The AI agent asks step-by-step questions:  
  - Type of service (haircut, facial, manicure, etc.)  
  - Preferred stylist (optional)  
  - Preferred date & time  
  - Any additional notes (special treatments, products, etc.)  
- Once details are gathered, it generates a draft appointment summary.

### 2. Confirmation & Personal Details
- The user reviews the draft and confirms.  
- The assistant then asks for personal details (name, email, phone number).

### 3. Booking & Notifications
- After confirmation, the details are sent to **Google Calendar** to create an appointment.  
- A **confirmation email** is sent to the user with all booking information.  
- A final webhook response confirms that the appointment is successfully booked.

## How to Use
- Triggered directly via a **Webhook URL** (can be embedded in your salon website or mobile app).  
- Simply fill in the details, and the assistant will guide the user step by step until the booking is finalized.  
- Once completed, the user receives both an **email confirmation** and an on-screen success message.
