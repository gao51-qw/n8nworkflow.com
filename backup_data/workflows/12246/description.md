## How It Works
***Top Branch Workflow A***

**1. The Market Intelligence:** 
- **Patrols the Market:** Runs hourly to scrape competitor rates for future days.
- **Gathers Intel:** If prices spike, it instantly checks event announcements to see if a major event is driving demand.
- **Crunches Numbers:** Calculates the exact price gap and filters out noise.

**2. The Revenue Manager:** 
- **Sets Strategy:** The AI Agent reviews the price gaps, competitor moves, and event signals.
- **Reports:** Writes a strategic Executive Summary and sends it to your WhatsApp.


***Bottom Branch Workflow B***

**3. The Consultant:** 
 - **Recall:** When you ask a question via WhatsApp, the bot retrieves the saved analysis, historical rates, and event schedule.
  - **Answer:** It acts as an on-demand analyst, conducting further analysis to give an informed answer to questions


## Setup Steps
**1. Config:** Add your hotel + competitor hotels (IDs/names) in the Config node.

**2. Monitor Window:** Set how far ahead you want to monitor (e.g., daysAhead = 30) in the Config node.

**3. Sensitivity:** Set how sensitive alerts should be (e.g., alert only if competitor moves &gt; 10%) in the Significant Competitor Change node.

**4. Connect Credentials:**

- Amadeus (to fetch hotel prices)
- WhatsApp (to send alerts)
- Postgres/SQL (to store price snapshots, history, summary)
- OpenAI (for the AI Agents)

**5. Event Source:** Update the Fetch VCC nodes to scrape your local convention center or event site.

**6. Run a test:**

Trigger Workflow A manually and confirm you receive a WhatsApp alert.

Reply to that WhatsApp message to test Workflow B (Q&A).
