  "description": "# Zillow Property Scraper Using Olostep API  \n\nThis n8n template automates Zillow property data collection by scraping Zillow search results using the Olostep API.  \nIt extracts **property price, link to listing, and location**, removes duplicates, and stores everything in a Google Sheet or Data Table.\n\n## Who’s it for  \n- Real estate analysts and investors researching property markets.  \n- Lead generators needing structured Zillow data.  \n- Freelancers and automation builders collecting housing listings.  \n- Anyone needing fast, clean Zillow data without manual scraping.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Form Trigger**  \n   - User enters a Zillow search URL.  \n   - This becomes the base Zillow search URL.\n\n2. **Pagination Logic**  \n   - A list of page numbers (1–7) is generated.  \n   - Each number is used to load the next Zillow search page.\n\n3. **Scrape Zillow Pages with Olostep**  \n   - For each page, the Olostep API scrapes the Zillow results.  \n   - Olostep’s LLM extraction schema extracts:  \n     - **price**  \n     - **url** (link to the Zillow listing)  \n     - **location**\n\n4. **Parse & Split Results**  \n   - Returned JSON is cleaned and converted into individual listing items.\n\n5. **Remove Duplicates**  \n   - Ensures each Zillow listing appears only once.\n\n6. **Insert into Google Sheet / Data Table**  \n   - Final cleaned listings are inserted row-by-row.  \n   - Perfect for filtering, exporting, or further analysis.\n\nThis workflow gives you a fast, scalable property scraper using Zillow + Olostep — no browser automation, no manual copy/paste.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import the template into n8n.  \n2. Add your **Olostep API key**.  \n3. Connect your **Google Sheet or n8n Data Table**.  \n4. Deploy the form and start scraping by entering a place name.\n\n## Requirements  \n- Olostep API key  \n- Google Sheets account or Data Table  \n- n8n cloud or self-hosted instance  \n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- Add more pages to the pagination array (e.g., 1–20).  \n- Expand the LLM extraction schema to include:  \n  - number of bedrooms  \n  - number of bathrooms  \n  - square footage  \n  - property type  \n- Trigger via Telegram or API instead of a form.  \n- Send results to Airtable or Notion instead of Google Sheets.  \n\n---\n\n👉 This template gives you an automated Zillow scraper powered by AI extraction — perfect for real estate lead gen or market research.",
