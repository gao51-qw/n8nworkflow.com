# Fact-Checking Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This workflow is designed for automated fact-checking of texts. It uses AI models to compare a given text with a list of facts and identify potential discrepancies or hallucinations.

## Components

### 1. Input
- The workflow can be initiated in two ways:
  a) Manually via the "When clicking 'Test workflow'" trigger
  b) By calling from another workflow via the "When Executed by Another Workflow" trigger
- Required inputs: 
  - `facts`: A list of verified facts
  - `text`: The text to be checked

### 2. Text Preparation
- The "Code" node splits the input text into individual sentences
- Takes into account date specifications and list elements

### 3. Fact Checking
- Each sentence is individually compared with the given facts
- Uses the "bespoke-minicheck" Ollama model for verification
- The model responds with "Yes" or "No" for each sentence

### 4. Filtering and Aggregation
- Sentences marked as "No" (not fact-based) are filtered
- The filtered results are aggregated

### 5. Summary
- A larger language model (Qwen2.5) creates a summary of the results
- The summary contains:
  - Number of incorrect factual statements
  - List of incorrect statements
  - Final assessment of the article's accuracy

## Usage
1. Ensure the "bespoke-minicheck" model is installed in Ollama (`ollama pull bespoke-minicheck`)
2. Prepare a list of verified facts
3. Enter the text to be checked
4. Start the workflow
5. The results are output as a structured summary

## Notes
- The workflow ignores small talk and focuses on verifiable factual statements
- Accuracy depends on the quality of the provided facts and the performance of the AI models

## Customization Options
- The summarization function can be adjusted or removed to return only the raw data of the issues found
- The AI models used can be exchanged if needed

This workflow provides an efficient method for automated fact-checking and can be easily integrated into larger systems or editorial workflows.
