  "description": "# Fact-Checking Workflow Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThis workflow is designed for automated fact-checking of texts. It uses AI models to compare a given text with a list of facts and identify potential discrepancies or hallucinations.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. Input\n- The workflow can be initiated in two ways:\n  a) Manually via the \"When clicking 'Test workflow'\" trigger\n  b) By calling from another workflow via the \"When Executed by Another Workflow\" trigger\n- Required inputs: \n  - `facts`: A list of verified facts\n  - `text`: The text to be checked\n\n### 2. Text Preparation\n- The \"Code\" node splits the input text into individual sentences\n- Takes into account date specifications and list elements\n\n### 3. Fact Checking\n- Each sentence is individually compared with the given facts\n- Uses the \"bespoke-minicheck\" Ollama model for verification\n- The model responds with \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each sentence\n\n### 4. Filtering and Aggregation\n- Sentences marked as \"No\" (not fact-based) are filtered\n- The filtered results are aggregated\n\n### 5. Summary\n- A larger language model (Qwen2.5) creates a summary of the results\n- The summary contains:\n  - Number of incorrect factual statements\n  - List of incorrect statements\n  - Final assessment of the article's accuracy\n\n## Usage\n1. Ensure the \"bespoke-minicheck\" model is installed in Ollama (`ollama pull bespoke-minicheck`)\n2. Prepare a list of verified facts\n3. Enter the text to be checked\n4. Start the workflow\n5. The results are output as a structured summary\n\n## Notes\n- The workflow ignores small talk and focuses on verifiable factual statements\n- Accuracy depends on the quality of the provided facts and the performance of the AI models\n\n## Customization Options\n- The summarization function can be adjusted or removed to return only the raw data of the issues found\n- The AI models used can be exchanged if needed\n\nThis workflow provides an efficient method for automated fact-checking and can be easily integrated into larger systems or editorial workflows.",
