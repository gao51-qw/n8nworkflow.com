  "description": "# Real-Time Uptime Alerts to Jira with Smart Slack On-Call Routing\n\nThis workflow automatically converts uptime monitoring alerts received via webhook into Jira incident tasks and intelligently notifies an available on-call team member on Slack based on their real-time presence status. It ensures critical service outages never go unnoticed by selecting an active responder and sending a detailed direct message immediately.\n\n### ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps\n\n1. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.  \n2. Configure your **Webhook**, **Slack**, and **Jira** credentials.  \n3. Update the IF node to filter for `status = down` (already configured).  \n4. Set the Jira project and issue type as required.  \n5. Connect your Slack on-call channel.  \n6. Activate the workflow and send a test alert using Postman or your monitoring tool.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis automation listens for incoming alerts from any uptime monitoring service. When a system or service goes down, the workflow instantly validates whether the alert is critical (status = *down*). Once validated, it automatically creates a detailed Jira Task containing all relevant service details such as timestamp, downtime duration, error code, customer impact and priority.\n\nAfter the Jira incident is created, the workflow retrieves a list of all members from a dedicated Slack on-call rotation channel. It checks each member’s Slack presence (active, away, offline) and uses smart selection logic to choose the best person to notify. The selected team member then receives a richly formatted direct Slack message containing all incident details and a link to the Jira ticket.\n\nThis ensures the alert is not only logged properly but also reaches the right responder at the right time.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\n- DevOps teams managing uptime & system reliability.\n- Support teams responsible for incident response.\n- SRE teams using Jira and Slack.\n- Organizations with an on-call rotation setup.\n- Teams wanting automated escalation for downtime alerts.\n\n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\n- **n8n installed** (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- **Slack API credentials** with permission to read user presence and send direct messages  \n- **Jira Software Cloud** credentials allowing issue creation  \n- **A monitoring system** capable of sending webhook alerts (e.g., UptimeRobot, Uptime Kuma, StatusCake, custom system, etc.)  \n- Access to a Slack channel that includes your on-call rotation members  \n\n\n## How It Works & How to Set Up\n\n### Step 1: Receive Alert from Uptime Monitoring Tool\n\n- The workflow starts with the **Webhook node** (`Receive Uptime Alert`).  \n- Your monitoring tool must send a POST request with JSON payload including fields like:\n  - `serviceName`\n  - `status`\n  - `timestamp`\n  - `customerImpact`\n  - `errorCode`\n  - `priority`\n  - etc.\n\n### Step 2: Filter for Critical Status\n\n- The **IF node** (`Filter for Critical Status`) checks:\n- Only when the service is *down* does the workflow continue to create a Jira incident.\n\n### Step 3: Create Jira Incident Task\n\n- The **Create New Jira Incident** node generates a Jira **Task** with:\n- Summary: `serviceName + timestamp`\n- Description: dynamic fields based on the alert payload  \n- Set your Jira **Project** and **Issue Type** as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Fetch Slack On-Call Channel Members\n\n- The workflow calls Slack API to retrieve all user IDs in a designated channel (e.g., `#on-call-team`).\n\n### Step 5: Loop Through Each Member\n\n- **Split In Batches Node** loops each Slack member individually.\n- For each user, their Slack **presence** is fetched using:\n\n### Step 6: Build Final Data for Each User\n\n- The **Set node** (`Collect & Set Final Data`) stores:\n- presence  \n- member ID  \n- service details  \n- Jira ticket ID  \n- downtime info  \n- and more  \n\n### Step 7: Select the Best On-Call User\n\nA custom **Code node** uses presence-based logic:\n\n#### Selection Logic\n\n1. If one or more users are **active** → randomly pick one active user.  \n2. If only one user is active → pick that user.  \n3. If **no users are active** → default to the **first** member from the channel.  \n\nThis ensures you always get a responder.\n\n### Step 8: Notify Selected User\n\n- The **Slack Notify Node** sends a formatted direct message with:\n- service status  \n- downtime duration  \n- error code  \n- customer impact  \n- Jira ticket link  \n- priority  \n\nThe selected on-call responder receives everything they need to act immediately.\n\n\n## How to Customize Nodes\n\n### Webhook Node\n\n- Change the path to something meaningful (e.g., `/uptime-alerts`).\n- Customize expected fields based on your monitoring tool's payload.\n\n### IF Node\n\n- Modify status condition for:\n- `\"critical\"`  \n- `\"error\"`  \n- or multiple conditions  \n\n### Jira Node\n\nYou can customize:\n- Issue type (Incident, Bug, Task)\n- Priority field mapping\n- Project ID\n- Custom fields or labels\n\n### Slack Retrieval Node\n\n- Change the channel to your team's actual on-call rotation channel.\n\n### Slack Message Node\n\n- Modify message formatting, tone, emojis, or add links.\n- Add @mentions or tags.\n- Include escalation instructions.\n\n\n## Add-Ons (Optional Extensions)\n\nEnhance the workflow by adding:\n\n### 1. Escalation Logic\n\nIf the selected user doesn’t respond within X minutes, notify next user.\n\n### 2. PagerDuty / OpsGenie Integration\n\nTrigger paging systems for SEV-1 incidents.\n\n### 3. Status Page Updates\n\nAutomatically update public status pages.\n\n### 4. Auto-Resolution\n\nWhen service status returns to *up*, automatically:\n\n- Update Jira ticket  \n- Notify the team  \n- Close the incident  \n\n### 5. Logging & Analytics\n\nStore incidents in Google Sheets, Notion, or a database.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\nThis workflow can support multiple real-world scenarios:\n\n1. **Website Uptime Monitoring**  \n If your main website goes down, instantly create a Jira incident and notify your on-call engineer.\n\n2. **API Downtime Alerting**  \n When an API endpoint fails health checks, alert active developers only.\n\n3. **Microservices Monitoring**  \n Each microservice alert triggers a consistent, automated incident creation and notification.\n\n4. **Infrastructure Failure Detection**  \n When servers, containers, or VMs become unreachable, escalate to your infrastructure team.\n\n5. **Database Performance Degradation**  \n If DB uptime drops or error rate spikes, create a Jira ticket and ping the database admin.\n\nAnd many more variations of outage, error, and performance monitoring events.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------------|----------|\n| Workflow not triggering | Webhook URL not updated in monitoring tool | Copy n8n webhook URL and update in monitoring source |\n| No Jira ticket created | Invalid Jira credentials or missing project permissions | Reauthorize Jira credentials and verify permissions |\n| Slack users not found | Wrong channel ID or bot not added to channel | Ensure bot is invited to the Slack channel |\n| Slack presence not returning | Slack app lacks presence permission (`users:read.presence`) | Update Slack API scopes and reinstall |\n| No user receives notification | Presence logic always returns empty list | Test Slack presence API and verify real-time presence |\n| Wrong user selected | Intended selection logic differs | Update the JS logic in the code node |\n| Jira fields not populated | Alert payload fields missing | Verify webhook payload structure and match expected fields |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you need assistance setting up this workflow, customizing integrations, building escalations or extending the logic with add-ons — **WeblineIndia is here to help**.\n\nWe can assist with:\n- Custom Slack/Jira/Monitoring automation  \n- On-call rotation logic enhancements  \n- Cloud deployment & workflow optimization  \n- Any custom n8n automation  \n- Production-grade monitoring workflows  \n\n👉 **Contact WeblineIndia for professional support, implementation and [custom workflow development](https://www.weblineindia.com/n8n-automation/).**",
