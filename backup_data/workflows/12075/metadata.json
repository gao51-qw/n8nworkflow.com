  "description": "## What Problem Does It Solve?\n- We’ve all been there: you want to check if a product is cheaper on Amazon or Jumia, but opening a dozen tabs is a pain.\n- Building a bot to do this usually fails because big e-commerce sites love to block scrapers with CAPTCHAs.\n- This workflow fixes that headache by:\n  - Taking a product name from a chat message.\n  - Using **Decodo** to handle the hard part—searching Google and scraping the product pages without getting blocked.\n  - Using AI to read the messy HTML and pull out just the price and product name.\n  - Sending a clean \"Best Price\" summary back to the user instantly.\n\n## How to Configure It\n### Telegram Setup\n- Create a bot with BotFather and paste your token into the Telegram node.\n- Make sure your webhook is set up so the bot actually \"hears\" the messages.\n\n### Decodo \n- This is the engine that makes the workflow reliable.\n- You'll need to add your **Decodo API key** in the credentials.\n- We used Decodo here specifically because it handles the proxies and browser fingerprinting for you—so your Amazon requests actually go through instead of failing.\n\n### AI Setup\n- Plug in your OpenAI API key (or swap the node for Claude/Gemini if you prefer).\n- The system prompt is already set up to ignore ads and find the real price, but feel free to tweak the tone.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Trigger:** You text the bot a product name (e.g., \"Sony XM5\").\n2. **Search:** The workflow asks **Decodo** to Google that specific term on sites like Amazon.eg.\n3. **Scrape:** It grabs the URLs and passes them back to Decodo to fetch the page content safely.\n4. **Extract:** The AI reads through the text, finds the lowest price, and ignores the clutter.\n5. **Reply:** The bot texts you back with the best deal found.\n\n## Customization Ideas\n- **Go wider:** Edit the search query to check other stores like Noon or Carrefour.\n- **Track trends:** Connect a Google Sheet to log what people are searching for—great for market research.\n\nIf you need any help [Get In Touch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdallaelshikh0/)",
