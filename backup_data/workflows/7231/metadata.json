  "description": "**What it does**\nCaptures token usage and cost from your AI Agent/LLM. Logs model, tokens, cost, tool use, and conversation I/O to Google Sheets for simple observability and billing.\n\n**Perfect for**\nDevelopers adding usage monitoring to AI agents.\nTeams needing cost transparency in prototypes.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. Chat Trigger collects user input for the AI Agent.\n2. A Set node injects metadata like workflow, execution, and client IDs.\n3. LangChain Code node returns a configured Chat model with a callback that reads usage metadata.\n4. The callback computes input, output, and total costs based on per‑million token prices you define.\n5. It appends token metrics to a Google Sheet via the Google Sheets Tool.\n6. The Agent records intermediate tool calls.\n7. An If node checks whether a tool was used.\n8. When tools are used, the workflow logs input, output, tool name, and metadata to an Observability sheet.\n\n**How to use**\nSELF-HOSTED N8N ONLY - the Langchain Code node is only available in the self-hosted version of n8n. It is not available in n8n cloud.\n\n**Requirements**\nSelf-hosted version of n8n\n\n\n**If you have any questions in running the workflow, see the attached video:** https://youtu.be/JSulRS128MA",
