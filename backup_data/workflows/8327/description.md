## Import Forex Factory Calendar To Google Calendar
### Purpose of this n8n Template
1. Import Forex Factory Calendar events into Google Calendar.
2. Delete past Forex Factory Calendar events from Google Calendar.

### Use Cases:
* Get reminders for important economic data releases — especially High Impact news.
* Use as a trigger for opening trading positions.

### How It Works (Adding Next Week’s Events to Google Calendar)
* Every Sunday, the workflow fetches the next week’s events (.ics file) using the HTTP node.
* The file is parsed with the Extract From File node.
* Events are split using the Split Out node so each event is processed separately.
* Events are classified into three categories — High, Medium, and Low Impact — using the Switch node.
* High Impact news is added to Google Calendar with a popup reminder set 30 minutes before release.
* Medium Impact news is added to Google Calendar without a reminder.
* Low Impact news is ignored.

### How It Works (Deleting Past Events from Google Calendar)
* The workflow retrieves events from the past 10 days using the Google Calendar node.
* If an event is related to Forex Factory, it will be deleted.
* If it is not related, it will be left untouched.

### How to Use
* Enter your credentials for all Google Calendar nodes.

### Requirements
* A valid Google Calendar credential.
