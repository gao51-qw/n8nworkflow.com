Scheduled Check (Cron Node)\nThis is the workflow's trigger. It schedules the workflow to run at a specific, regular interval.\n* **Function:** Continuously runs on a set schedule, for example, every Monday morning.\n* **Process:** The **Cron** node automatically initiates the workflow, ensuring routine data breach scans are performed without manual intervention.\n\n### 2. List Emails to Check (Code Node)\nThis node acts as your static database, defining which email addresses to monitor for breaches.\n* **Function:** Stores a list of email addresses from your team or customers in a single, easy-to-update array.\n* **Process:** It configures the list of emails that are then processed by the subsequent nodes. This makes it simple to add or remove addresses as needed.\n\n### 3. Query HIBP API (HTTP Request Node)\nThis node connects to the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API to check for breaches.\n* **Function:** Queries the HIBP API for each email address on your list.\n* **Process:** It sends a request to the HIBP API. The API responds with a list of data breaches that the email was found in, if any.\n\n### 4. Is Breached? (If Node)\nThis is the core detection logic. It checks the API response to see if any breach data was returned.\n* **Function:** Compares the API's response to an empty array.\n* **Process:** If the API response is **not empty**, it indicates a breach has been found, and the workflow is routed to the notification node. If the response is empty, the workflow ends safely.\n\n### 5. Send High-Priority Alert (Slack Node) / End Workflow (No-Op Node)\nThese nodes represent the final action of the workflow.\n* **Function:** Responds to a detected breach.\n* **Process:** If a breach is found, the **Slack** node sends an urgent alert to your team's security channel, notifying them of the compromised email. If no breaches are found, the **No-Op** node ends the workflow without any notification.\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up\n\nImplementing this essential cybersecurity monitor in your n8n instance is quick and straightforward.\n\n### 1. Prepare Your Credentials & API\nBefore building the workflow, ensure all necessary accounts are set up and their credentials are ready.\n\n* **HIBP API Key:** You need to get an **API key** from haveibeenpwned.com. This key is required to access the API.\n* **Slack Credential:** Set up a **Slack credential** in n8n and note the **Channel ID** of your security alert channel (e.g., `#security-alerts`).\n\n### 2. Import the Workflow JSON\nGet the workflow structure into your n8n instance.\n\n* **Import:** In your n8n instance, navigate to the \"Workflows\" section. Click the \"New\" or \"+\" icon, then select \"Import from JSON.\" Paste the provided JSON code into the import dialog and import the workflow.\n\n### 3. Configure the Nodes\nCustomize the imported workflow to fit your specific monitoring needs.\n\n* **Scheduled Check (Cron):** Set the schedule according to your preference (e.g., every Monday at 8:00 AM).\n* **List Emails to Check (Code):** Open this node and **edit the `emailsToCheck` array**. Enter the list of company email addresses you want to monitor.\n* **Query HIBP API (HTTP Request):** Open this node and in the \"Headers\" section, add the header `hibp-api-key` with the value of your HIBP API key.\n* **Send High-Priority Alert (Slack):** Select your **Slack credential** and replace `YOUR_SECURITY_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual **Channel ID**.\n\n### 4. Test and Activate\nVerify that your workflow is working correctly before setting it live.\n\n* **Manual Test:** Run the workflow manually. You can test with a known breached email address (you can find examples online) to ensure the alert is triggered.\n* **Verify:** Check your specified Slack channel to confirm that the alert is sent with the correct information.\n* **Activate:** Once you're confident in its function, activate the workflow. n8n will now automatically monitor your important accounts for data breaches on the schedule you set.",
