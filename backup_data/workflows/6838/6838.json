    "description": "---\n\n## How It Works: The 5-Node Security Flow\n\nThis workflow efficiently performs a scheduled data breach scan.\n\n### 1. Scheduled Check (Cron Node)\nThis is the workflow's trigger. It schedules the workflow to run at a specific, regular interval.\n* **Function:** Continuously runs on a set schedule, for example, every Monday morning.\n* **Process:** The **Cron** node automatically initiates the workflow, ensuring routine data breach scans are performed without manual intervention.\n\n### 2. List Emails to Check (Code Node)\nThis node acts as your static database, defining which email addresses to monitor for breaches.\n* **Function:** Stores a list of email addresses from your team or customers in a single, easy-to-update array.\n* **Process:** It configures the list of emails that are then processed by the subsequent nodes. This makes it simple to add or remove addresses as needed.\n\n### 3. Query HIBP API (HTTP Request Node)\nThis node connects to the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API to check for breaches.\n* **Function:** Queries the HIBP API for each email address on your list.\n* **Process:** It sends a request to the HIBP API. The API responds with a list of data breaches that the email was found in, if any.\n\n### 4. Is Breached? (If Node)\nThis is the core detection logic. It checks the API response to see if any breach data was returned.\n* **Function:** Compares the API's response to an empty array.\n* **Process:** If the API response is **not empty**, it indicates a breach has been found, and the workflow is routed to the notification node. If the response is empty, the workflow ends safely.\n\n### 5. Send High-Priority Alert (Slack Node) / End Workflow (No-Op Node)\nThese nodes represent the final action of the workflow.\n* **Function:** Responds to a detected breach.\n* **Process:** If a breach is found, the **Slack** node sends an urgent alert to your team's security channel, notifying them of the compromised email. If no breaches are found, the **No-Op** node ends the workflow without any notification.\n\n---\n\n## How to Set Up\n\nImplementing this essential cybersecurity monitor in your n8n instance is quick and straightforward.\n\n### 1. Prepare Your Credentials & API\nBefore building the workflow, ensure all necessary accounts are set up and their credentials are ready.\n\n* **HIBP API Key:** You need to get an **API key** from haveibeenpwned.com. This key is required to access the API.\n* **Slack Credential:** Set up a **Slack credential** in n8n and note the **Channel ID** of your security alert channel (e.g., `#security-alerts`).\n\n### 2. Import the Workflow JSON\nGet the workflow structure into your n8n instance.\n\n* **Import:** In your n8n instance, navigate to the \"Workflows\" section. Click the \"New\" or \"+\" icon, then select \"Import from JSON.\" Paste the provided JSON code into the import dialog and import the workflow.\n\n### 3. Configure the Nodes\nCustomize the imported workflow to fit your specific monitoring needs.\n\n* **Scheduled Check (Cron):** Set the schedule according to your preference (e.g., every Monday at 8:00 AM).\n* **List Emails to Check (Code):** Open this node and **edit the `emailsToCheck` array**. Enter the list of company email addresses you want to monitor.\n* **Query HIBP API (HTTP Request):** Open this node and in the \"Headers\" section, add the header `hibp-api-key` with the value of your HIBP API key.\n* **Send High-Priority Alert (Slack):** Select your **Slack credential** and replace `YOUR_SECURITY_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual **Channel ID**.\n\n### 4. Test and Activate\nVerify that your workflow is working correctly before setting it live.\n\n* **Manual Test:** Run the workflow manually. You can test with a known breached email address (you can find examples online) to ensure the alert is triggered.\n* **Verify:** Check your specified Slack channel to confirm that the alert is sent with the correct information.\n* **Activate:** Once you're confident in its function, activate the workflow. n8n will now automatically monitor your important accounts for data breaches on the schedule you set.",

            "content": "## Problem\nAs an AI Agent developer, you know that one of the biggest threats to businesses is compromised credentials. Employees often use corporate emails to sign up for third-party services. When those services are breached, their credentials can leak, and attackers can use them to try and gain access to your internal systems (known as a **credential stuffing attack**). Manually monitoring every email account for breaches is an impossible task.\n\n## Solution\nThis n8n workflow offers a proactive and efficient solution. It **periodically checks a list of company email addresses against the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API**—a trusted database of leaked credentials. If an email address is found in a data breach, the workflow will immediately send an **urgent alert to Slack**, allowing your security team to take swift action, such as forcing a password reset or temporarily suspending the account, before attackers can exploit the leaked data.\n\n## For Whom\nThis simple yet vital automation is ideal for:\n* **Security & IT Teams:** To proactively monitor at-risk credentials.\n* **System Admins & HR:** To detect security risks on employee accounts.\n* **Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (SMEs):** To implement a strong, yet easy-to-deploy, layer of foundational security.\n* **Any Organization:** That wants to reduce the risk of credential stuffing attacks and protect internal data.\n\n---\n\n## Scope\n* **What it does:**\n    * Runs on a customizable schedule (e.g., every week).\n    * Checks a list of specified email addresses against the HaveIBeenPwned database.\n    * Sends a detailed, urgent alert to a designated Slack channel if a breach is detected for an email.\n* **What it doesn't do:**\n    * This workflow **does not automatically fix the issue** or reset passwords. It is a detection and alerting tool only.\n    * It does not monitor other security vectors, such as network activity or file changes.\n\n---\n\n### How to Set Up\nHere is a step-by-step guide to implement this workflow in your n8n instance.\n\n1.  **Prepare Your Credentials**\n    * **HIBP API Key:** You need to get an **API key** from haveibeenpwned.com. This key is required to access the API.\n    * **Slack Credential:** Create a **Slack credential** in n8n. Note the **Channel ID** of your security alert channel (e.g., `#security-alerts`).\n\n2.  **Import the Workflow JSON**\n    * Create a new workflow in n8n and import the JSON code (which was provided in a previous response).\n\n3.  **Configure the Nodes**\n    * **Scheduled Check (Cron):** Set the schedule according to your preference (e.g., every Monday at 8:00 AM).\n    * **List Emails to Check (Code):** Open this node and **edit the `emailsToCheck` array**. Enter the list of company email addresses you want to monitor.\n    * **Query HIBP API (HTTP Request):** Open this node and in the \"Headers\" section, add the header `hibp-api-key` with the value of your HIBP API key.\n    * **Send High-Priority Alert (Slack):** Select your **Slack credential** and replace `YOUR_SECURITY_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual **Channel ID**.\n\n4.  **Test and Activate**\n    * **Manual Test:** Run the workflow manually. You can test with a known breached email address (you can find examples online) to ensure the alert is triggered.\n    * **Verify Output:** Check your specified Slack channel to confirm that the alert is sent with the correct information.\n    * **Activate:** Once you're confident in its function, activate the workflow. n8n will now automatically monitor your important accounts for data breaches on the schedule you set."
