✅ **Tip:** No coding experience needed — just follow the step-by-step documentation PDF provided in your Gumroad download. Everything is laid out clearly to get you running fast.

💰**Costs** Song generation costs (suno): $5 gets you 1000 credits, 1 song generation costs 12 credits, every api call for one song generates two versions by default. Check the song generation node to see the two versions. You can update the GSheet to append the two versions and send back to you to choose one. Flux Image gen cost is $0.04 per image. Runway cost is $0.16 per 10 seconds of video.
