## Who’s it for  
Growth hackers, community builders, and marketers who want to keep their Twitter (X) accounts active by *liking posts from selected profiles* automatically.  

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Schedule Trigger** fires hourly.  
2. **Profile Post Extractor** fetches up to 20 tweets for each profile in your CSV.  
3. **Select Cookie** rotates Twitter session-cookies.  
4. **Get Random Post** checks against `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv`.  
5. Builds `twitter_posts_to_like.csv`, uploads to SharePoint.  
6. **Phantombuster Autolike Agent** likes the tweet.  
7. Logs the liked URL to avoid duplicates.  

## How to set up  
- Add Phantombuster + SharePoint credentials.  
- In SharePoint “Phantombuster” folder:  
  • `twitter_session_cookies.txt`  
  • `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv` (header `postUrl`)  
  • `profiles_twitter.csv` (list of profiles).  

## Profile CSV format  
Your `profiles_twitter.csv` must contain a header `profileUrl` and direct links to the Twitter profiles. Example:  
```csv
profileUrl
