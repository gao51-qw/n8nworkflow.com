  "description": "## Advanced Retry and Delay Logic\n\nThis template provides a robust solution for handling API rate limits and temporary service outages in n8n workflows. It overcomes the limitations of the default node retry settings, which cap retries at 5 and delays at 5 seconds. By using a custom loop with a `Set`, `If`, and `Wait` node, this workflow gives you complete control over the number of retries and the delay between them.\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. Replace the placeholder **HTTP Request** node with your target node (the one that might fail).\n2. In the initial **Set Fields** node, modify the `max_tries` value to set the total number of attempts for your workflow.\n3. Adjust the `delay_seconds` value to define the initial delay between retries.\n4. Optionally, configure the `Edit Fields` node to implement exponential backoff by adjusting the `delay_seconds` expression (e.g., `{{$json.delay_seconds * 2}}`).\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown and tutorial of this template, you can find additional information [here](https://n8nplaybook.com/post/2025/06/mastering-custom-retry-and-delay-logic-in-n8n/).",
