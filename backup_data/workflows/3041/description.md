The **best content automation template** in the market is now even better—with “**deep research” on time-sensitive topics**\! Unlike most n8n content automation templates that are mainly for “demo purposes,” this advanced n8n workflow is for the real PROs. It conducts **in-depth research on the latest information about a topic**, then automatically creates and publishes **SEO-optimized blog posts** to your WordPress website. In addition, it generates **a unique image for each chapter and a featured image for the overall article**, and it collects internal website links—**seamlessly inserting links** throughout each chapter and the entire article. Furthermore, it **backs up all content and images** to a designated folder in your Google Drive.

This integrated approach not only creates high-quality, comprehensive content for readers but also enhances on-page SEO, improves navigation, and streamlines your content creation process—saving you time while ensuring your work is securely stored.

This is a complimentary variation of the n8n WordPress Auto-Blogging Pro for SEO topics. That one specializes in auto-blogging content about established topics that do not need up-to-date information while this one takes it further by incorporating online research into the workflow. Both make up the perfect combo to run your blog on autopilot\!

## How It Works

1. **Trigger:** It activates upon adding a new row to a Google Sheet. Users can control many customizable parameters, such as key topic, number of subtopics, target audience, length, and style.  
2. **Initial Research:** The workflow initiates preliminary research on the topic to gather insights for the content planning phase.  
3. **Structure Planning:** Based on the initial research, it plans a detailed structure for the entire article and breaks the article into subtopics strongly tied to the main topic.  
4. **In-Depth Research & Writing:** For each subtopic, it conducts further research to gather the most up-to-date, relevant information, then uses that research to write each chapter in depth.  
5. **Image Generation:** It generates and adds images for each chapter, as well as a featured image for the article.  
6. **Internal Linking:** The system gathers internal website links and strategically embeds them within each chapter and throughout the article, boosting SEO and enhancing user navigation.  
7. **Final Assembly & Publishing:** All texts, images, and links are combined into one comprehensive article, which is then published directly to your WordPress website. You can also choose to post it as a draft for final review.  
8. **Auto Backup to Drive:** Get peace of mind knowing all content (blog post and images) is automatically saved to Google Drive, organized in a folder named after the blog post title.

## Tips for PROs

1. **Image Generation:** The default AI model for image generation is OpenAI’s Dall-E. However, the outputs of this model are not impressive. Consider using FLUX.1 for better image quality.  
2. **Research:** PerplexityAI is the tool of choice for research. The default model used in this workflow is “sonar” due to its fast speed and low cost. Feel free to experiment with its other models, including the “sonar-deep-research” model, which is dedicated to deep research.  
3. **Triggering:** Triggering with a new row on Google Sheets is limited and unreliable. Consider setting an auto trigger with a daily schedule at a specific time. You can even put the whole workflow in a loop to process multiple rows one-by-one from Google Sheets.  
4. **Human in the Loop:** It is possible to incorporate a human review process. For example, after the article is posted to WordPress as a draft, a human can review the draft. Only after approval will the post be published, and a final copy of the post will be saved to the shared Drive folder.
