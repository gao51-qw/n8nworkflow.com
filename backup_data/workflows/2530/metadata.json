  "description": "his workflow automates time tracking using location-based triggers.\n\n## How it works\n- Trigger: It starts when you enter or exit a specified location, triggering a shortcut on your iPhone.\n- Webhook: The shortcut sends a request to a webhook in n8n.\n- Check-In/Check-Out: The webhook receives the request and records the time and whether it was a \"Check-In\" or \"Check-Out\" event.\n- Google Sheets: This data is then logged into a Google Sheet, creating a record of your work hours.\n\n## Set up steps\n1. Google Drive: Connect your Google Drive account.\n2. Google Sheets: Connect your Google Sheets account.\n3. Webhook: Set up a webhook node in n8n.\n4. iPhone Shortcuts: Create two shortcuts on your iPhone, one for \"Check-In\" and one for \"Check-Out.\"\n5. Configure Shortcuts: Configure each shortcut to send a request to the webhook with the appropriate \"Direction\" header.\n\nIt's easy to setup, around 5 minutes.",
