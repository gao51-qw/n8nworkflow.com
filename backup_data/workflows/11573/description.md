## Who Is This For

Marketing teams, social media managers, and brand strategists who want to understand competitor visual strategies across multiple platforms. Perfect for agencies managing multiple client accounts or brands looking to benchmark their visual content.

## What This Template Does

This workflow automates competitive visual intelligence gathering across Instagram and TikTok using AI-powered image analysis:

1. Collects recent posts from your account and up to 3 competitors via a simple form interface
2. Routes content to appropriate Apify scrapers based on selected platforms
3. Filters and processes image content from scraped posts
4. Analyzes each image using GPT-4o Vision to extract color palettes, composition styles, mood/emotion, and text design elements
5. Generates a comprehensive competitive analysis report with actionable recommendations
6. Logs all analysis results to Google Sheets for historical tracking
