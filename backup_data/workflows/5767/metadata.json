  "description": "### This N8N template demonstrates how to use our tool to collect a list of videos from any YouTube channel - including video URLs, titles, descriptions, thumbnail links, publish dates, and more - all saved cleanly into a connected Google Sheet.\n\nUse cases are many: Whether you're **a YouTube content strategist** tracking competitors, **a marketing team** building dashboards from video metadata, or **an automation pro** connecting YouTube to downstream workflows, **researchers and analysts** collecting structured video data at scale, this tool gives you what you need!\n\n## How It Works\n- The workflow begins when you click **Execute Workflow** or **Test Workflow** manually in N8N.\n- It reads the list of full channel URLs, custom channel URLs or channel IDs from the **Channel URLs** tab in the connected Google Sheet. Only the channels with the **Ready** status will be processed.\n- A **Switch** node detects whether the input is a full/custom channel URL, or a raw channel ID, and routes it accordingly.\n     + If the input is already a **channel ID**, the tool prepares the data structure before sending it to the YouTube API call in the next step.\n     + If the input is a **full channel URL** or a **custom channel URL**, the workflow extracts the **username**, then sends a **HTTP Request** to the YouTube API to retrieve the corresponding Channel ID, and prepares the data structure before continuing.\n- Once the valid **Channel ID** is set, the tool sends a request to YouTube API endpoint to retrieve a list of public videos. By default, the number of videos extracted per channel is limited to 10. \n- The API response is checked for success:\n     + If successful, the video data is split into individual entries, cleaned, and added to the **Videos** tab in the connected Google Sheet. The original rows' status in the **Channel URLs** tab is marked as **Finished**.\n     + If an error occurs, the rows' status in the **Channel URLs** tab is marked as **Error** for later review.\n\n## How To Use\n- Download the workflow package.\n- Import the workflow package into your N8N interface.\n- Duplicate the [**YouTube - Get Channel Videos** Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIdiUUx1PtEZXOzSUP3aJkrDaVcJdxCGRmCOT94BytA/edit?gid=426418282#gid=426418282) into your Google Sheets account.\n- Set up **Google Cloud Console** credentials in the following nodes in N8N, ensuring enabled access and suitable rights to Google Sheets and YouTube services:\n    + For Google Sheets access, ensure each node is properly connected to the correct tab in your connected Google Sheet: \n         Node **Google Sheets - Get Channel URLs** → connected to the **Channel URLs** tab; \n         Node **Google Sheets - Update Data** → connected to the **Videos** tab; \n         Node **Google Sheets - Update Data - Success** → connected to the **Channel URLs** tab; \n         Node **Google Sheets - Update Data - Error** → connected to the **Channel URLs** tab.\n    + For YouTube access, set up a GET method to connect to YouTube API in the following nodes:\n         Node **HTTP Request - Get Channel ID**;\n         Node **HTTP Request - Get Channel Videos**.\n- In your connected Google Sheet, enter the full channel URLs, custom channel URLs or channel IDs that you want to crawl and set the rows' status to **Ready**.\n- Run the workflow by clicking **Execute Workflow** or **Test Workflow** in N8N.\n- View the results in your connected Google Sheet: Successful fetches will update the original rows' status to **Finished** and the videos' information show up in the **Videos** tab. If any URL or ID fails, the rows' status will be marked as **Error**.\n\n## Requirements\n- Basic setup in Google Cloud Console (OAuth or API Key method enabled) with enabled access to YouTube and Google Sheets.\n\n## How To Customize\n- By default, the workflow is manually triggered in N8N. However, you can automate the process by adding **a Google Sheets trigger** that monitors new entries automatically.\n- If you want to fetch more video metadata like durations, or view counts, you can expand the HTTP Request and post-processing nodes to include those.\n- The workflow, by default, collects **up to 10 videos per channel**. If you’d like to fetch more, in the connected Google Sheet, simply enter your desired video number limit in **Column C** in the **Channel URLs** tab. The tool will use that value when calling the YouTube API.\n\n## Need Help?\nJoin our community on different platforms for support, inspiration and tips from others.\n\nWebsite: https://www.agentcircle.ai/\nEtsy: https://www.etsy.com/shop/AgentCircle\nGumroad: http://agentcircle.gumroad.com/\nDiscord Global: https://discord.gg/d8SkCzKwnP\nFB Page Global: https://www.facebook.com/agentcircle/\nFB Group Global: https://www.facebook.com/groups/aiagentcircle/\nX: https://x.com/agent_circle\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@agentcircle\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentcircle",
