  "description": "## 🧾 What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow takes a reference ad image and brand website, then uses GPT-4, LangChain, and Dumpling AI to generate 10 high-quality image variations for ad testing. These image variations are visually consistent but subtly different in background, mood, lighting, and tone — perfect for performance testing on platforms like Meta Ads or TikTok.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n\n- DTC marketers and brand designers testing ad creatives  \n- Creative teams automating visual experimentation  \n- Content agencies using AI for fast ad mockups  \n- Performance marketers running multivariate testing\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How to set up\n\n### ✅ Requirements\n\nYou’ll need the following tools set up in n8n:\n- Google Drive (OAuth2 credential)\n- Google Sheets (OAuth2 credential)\n- OpenAI API (for GPT-4 or GPT-4o)\n- Dumpling AI API (via HTTP header authentication)\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Steps to configure\n\n1. **Google Sheet Setup**  \n   - Create a sheet with one column: `Image URL`  \n   - Update the Sheet ID and tab name in the final Google Sheets node.\n\n2. **Drive Setup**  \n   - Create a folder in Google Drive for storing the reference image.  \n   - Replace the `folderId` in the “Upload Ad Image to Google Drive” node.\n\n3. **Dumpling AI API Key**  \n   - Use n8n’s credential manager (HTTP Header Auth) — do **not** hardcode the key.\n\n4. **OpenAI API Key**  \n   - Required for both image description and LangChain agent prompt generation.\n\n5. **Form Inputs Required**\n   - `Brand Name`  \n   - `Brand Website`  \n   - `Ad Image` (upload field)\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it works\n\n1. A user submits the brand name, website, and a reference ad image through a form.\n2. The image is uploaded to Google Drive.\n3. GPT-4o describes the image’s visual style (e.g., mood, lighting, composition).\n4. GPT-4 analyzes the brand’s website to define its visual aesthetic.\n5. A LangChain agent uses both analyses to create 10 tightly scoped variation prompts.\n6. Dumpling AI generates a new image for each prompt using its “FLUX.1-pro” model.\n7. Each new image’s link is logged into Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to customize\n\n- 🧪 Change prompt logic to experiment with different variations (e.g., theme, season).\n- 🎨 Switch image model in Dumpling AI to one that supports your desired style.\n- 🔗 Log additional metadata (prompt, timestamp) to Google Sheets.\n- 📤 Connect output images to Airtable, Notion, or a review tool like Figma.\n- 🎯 Modify GPT system message to reflect a different tone or brand strategy.\n\n---\n\nThis workflow gives creative teams and marketers an instant, AI-powered ad image testing system — built on real brand visuals, not generic stock content.\n",
