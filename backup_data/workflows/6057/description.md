*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

## How it works

This advanced automation builds a **fully autonomous SEO blog writer** using **n8n**, **Scrapeless**, **LLMs**, and **Pinecone vector database**. It’s powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that collects high-performing blog content, stores it in a vector store, and then generates new blog posts based on that knowledge—endlessly.

## Part 1: Build a Knowledge Base from Popular Blogs

- **Scrape existing articles** from a well-established writer (in this case, Mark Manson) using the Scrapeless node.
- **Extract content from blog pages** and store it in **Pinecone**, a powerful vector database that supports similarity search.
- **Use Gemini Embedding 001** or any other supported embedding model to encode blog content into vectors.
- **Result**: You’ll have a searchable vector store of expert-level content, ready to be used for content generation and intelligent search.

## Part 2: SERP Analysis & AI Blog Generation

- Use **Scrapeless' SERP node** to fetch search results based on your keyword and search intent.
- Send the results to an **LLM** (like Gemini, OpenRouter, or OpenAI) to generate a **keyword analysis report** in Markdown → then converted to HTML.
- Extract **long-tail keywords**, **search intent insights**, and **content angles** from this report.
- Feed everything into another LLM with access to your **Pinecone-stored knowledge base**, and generate a **fully SEO-optimized blog post**.
