## Who Is This For?

This workflow is designed for educators, universities, examination departments, and EdTech institutions that need a faster, smarter, and standardized way to prepare exam question papers.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Creating balanced, outcome-based question papers can take hours or even days of manual effort. Faculty often struggle to:

- Ensure syllabus coverage across units
- Maintain Bloom’s Taxonomy alignment
- Keep a consistent difficulty balance
- Format papers in institution-specific templates

# **How it works**

This workflow automatically generates an exam question paper based on syllabus topics submitted via a form and sends it to the entered email address.

Here’s the flow in simple steps:

**Form Submission** – A student or faculty fills out a form with subject code, syllabus topics, and their email.

**AI Question Generation** – The workflow passes the syllabus to AI agents (Part A with 2 Marks, Part B with 13 Marks, and Part C with 14 Marks) to create question sets. The marks and the no. of question generated can be customized according to the convenience. 

**Merging Questions** – All AI-generated questions are combined into a single structured document.

**Format into HTML** – The questions are formatted into a clean HTML exam paper (can also be extended to PDF).

**Send by Email**– The formatted exam paper is sent to the user’s email (with option to CC/BCC).

# Set up steps

**Connect Accounts** 

- Connect your OpenAI (or LLM) credentials for AI-powered question generation.

**Test & Deploy**

- Submit a test form entry.
