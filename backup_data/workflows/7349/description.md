Description

Automates vendor/customer security questionnaire responses. It ingests a questionnaire (Sheet/CSV/XLSX), matches each question to your approved answers and evidence, and writes a clean “Auto-Fill” sheet ready to review and send back. Optional alerts nudge reviewers and track progress to completion.

Who’s It For

GRC / Compliance teams responding to customer security reviews

Security engineers and sales engineers supporting questionnaires

Startups that need fast, consistent, audit-ready answers

How It Works

Trigger

Run manually, on a schedule, or when a questionnaire file/row is added.

Ingest & Normalize

Reads questions from Google Sheets/CSV/XLSX.

Normalizes columns (e.g., question, category, customer_notes) and de-duplicates.

Classify

Detects question type (Yes/No, multi-select, free text).

Tags topics (encryption, access control, incident response, privacy, HR, etc.).

Answer Retrieval

Looks up approved answers from your Answer Library sheet (mapped by keywords/category/control).

Falls back to templates (short form/long form) when no exact match exists.

Evidence Linking

Inserts Drive links for policies, diagrams, SOC2/ISO docs (from your evidence folder).

Adds version/date so reviewers can verify what was sent.

Auto-Fill Output

Writes a new sheet with columns like:
question, proposed_answer, rationale/notes, evidence_link, control_ref, owner, status, confidence, last_updated.

Review & Notifications

Emails the reviewer/owner with a link to the output sheet for quick approval edits.

Status can move from draft → reviewed → ready to send.

Export

Optional export to CSV/XLSX to match customer’s template.

Optional PDF of responses for audit trail.

Requirements

Google Sheets & Drive credentials

Destination Sheet & Evidence folder (env vars used in the template):

GSHEET_ID, GSHEET_SHEET

DRIVE_FOLDER_ID (or keep SANITIZED and set after import)

Alert email: GRC_ALERT_EMAIL

File Templates

GRC_SQ_AutoFill_Template.xlsx – target sheet with the output columns above

Answer_Library.xlsx / Sheet tab – key-value pairs: keywords/category → approved answers

Control_Mapping.xlsx / Sheet tab – optional mapping to ISO 27001, SOC2, NIST CSF

Output

A populated Auto-Fill sheet ready to review/share

Evidence links with versioning

Email notification to the reviewer with next steps

Customization Tips

Add your framework tags (ISO/SOC2/NIST) to enable quick mapping in the output.

Set owners per topic (e.g., “Encryption → Security Eng”, “Privacy → Legal”).

Add a confidence score threshold to flag answers needing human review.

Enable “strict mode” to prevent sending answers without evidence links.

Schedule a weekly run to pre-fill common questionnaires and keep answers fresh.
