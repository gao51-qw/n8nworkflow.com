### Context

Hi! I’m [Samir Saci](https://samirsaci.com), Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).

I built this workflow for an agency specialising in e-commerce to automate the daily compression of their images stored in a Google Drive folder.

[![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-23.png)](https://youtu.be/qXQVcaJgwrA)

This is particularly useful when managing large libraries of product photos, website assets or marketing visuals that need to stay lightweight for **SEO**, **website performance** or **storage optimisation**.

&gt; Test this workflow with the free tier of the API!

### Who is this template for?

This template is designed for:

- **E-commerce managers** who need to keep product images optimised  
- **Marketing teams** handling large volumes of visuals  
- **Website owners** wanting automatic image compression for SEO  
- **Anyone using Google Drive** to store images that gradually become too heavy  

### What does this workflow do?

This workflow acts as an **automated image compressor and reporting system** using Tinify, Google Drive, and Gmail.

1. Runs **every day at 08:00** using a Schedule Trigger  
2. Fetches all images from the Google Drive **Input** folder  
3. Downloads each file and sends it to the **Tinify API** for compression  
4. Downloads the optimised image and saves it to the **Compressed** folder  
5. Moves the original file to the **Original Images** archive  
6. Logs: `fileName`, `originalSize`, `compressedSize`, `imageId`, `outputUrl` and `processingId` into a **Data Table**  
7. After processing, it retrieves all logs for the current batch  
8. Generates a clean HTML report summarising the compression results  
9. Sends the report via **Gmail**, including total space saved  

Here is an example from my personal folder:

Here is the report generated for these images:

*P.S.: You can customise the report to match your company branding or visual identity.*
