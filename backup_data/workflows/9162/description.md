### How it works
• Webhook receives lead form submissions from your website
• AI Agent (GPT-4o) analyzes lead quality using intelligent scoring framework
• Clearbit enriches company data automatically (employee count, industry, revenue)
• Qualification score (0-100) determines routing: high-quality leads → HubSpot CRM + Slack alert, low-quality leads → Airtable for manual review
• Structured output parser ensures reliable JSON formatting every time

### Set up steps
• **Time to set up:** 15-20 minutes
• Import the Clearbit sub-workflow first (separate workflow file included)
• Create 7 custom properties in HubSpot (qualification_score, buying_intent, urgency_level, budget_indicator, ai_summary, pain_points, recommended_action)
• Create Airtable base with 14 columns for low-quality lead tracking
• Get Slack channel IDs for sales alerts and review requests
• Add credentials: OpenAI (GPT-4o), Clearbit API, HubSpot OAuth2, Slack OAuth2, Airtable Token
• Replace placeholder IDs in Slack and Airtable nodes
• Configure the Clearbit Enrichment Tool node with your sub-workflow ID
