It runs automatically on the 1st of each month, pulls P&L data from your accounting system for current and previous periods, performs variance analysis, calculates a financial health score (0-100), and identifies anomalies (>20% revenue swings, >15% expense growth, >25% budget variances). AI generates an executive summary with top concerns and actionable recommendations. Critical reports (health <50 or 3+ anomalies) route through CFO approval. The system creates a comprehensive PDF with color-coded metrics, archives it to Drive, emails stakeholders, and sends context-aware Slack alerts.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. **Connect accounting system API** - Update URLs in both \"Fetch P&L\" nodes (QuickBooks/Xero/NetSuite)\n2. **Add authentication** - Configure API credentials for accounting system\n3. **Add OpenAI API key** - For AI financial insights (GPT-4 recommended)\n4. **Set thresholds** - Adjust anomaly detection limits in \"Analyze Financial Data\" if needed\n5. **Add HTML to PDF API** - Get key at htmlcsstoimage.com\n6. **Connect Google Drive** - Authenticate for report archival\n7. **Connect Gmail** - Authenticate for stakeholder emails and CFO approvals\n8. **Add Slack webhook** - Get URL from Slack for team notifications\n9. **Configure stakeholders** - Edit recipient list in \"Prepare Report Data\" node\n10. **Test manually first** - Use \"Execute Workflow\" before enabling monthly schedule\n\n💡 **Required:** Accounting system API access with P&L data endpoints"
