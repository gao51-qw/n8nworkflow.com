  "description": "Quickly transform any LinkedIn profile URL into a concise, AI‑generated professional summary — perfect for recruiters, sales teams, and hiring managers who need instant insights into prospects or candidates without manual research.\n\n### How it works\n- The workflow polls a Google Sheet for new or updated rows containing LinkedIn profile URLs.\n- For each URL, the Real‑Time LinkedIn Scraper API (via RapidAPI) pulls experience and education sections.\n- Extracted profile data is sent to OpenAI’s GPT model, which generates a clean, structured summary highlighting key strengths, career trajectory, and differentiators.\n- The generated summary is written back into a new column in the same row of your Google Sheet for easy review and sharing.\n\n\n### Set up steps\n- Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet + worksheet containing your list of LinkedIn URLs.\n- Sign up for the Real‑Time LinkedIn Scraper API on RapidAPI, copy your API key, and add it to the workflow’s HTTP Request node.\n- Insert your OpenAI API key credentials.\n- Ensure your Google Sheet has one column for “linkedin_url” and create two empty columns named “full_name” and \"summary\" (or customize them based on your needs).\n- Run a single row through the workflow to verify scraping accuracy and summary formatting, then turn on the workflow for continuous automation.\n\n\nWith this template, eliminate hours of manual profile review — instantly gain actionable insights and focus on what really matters: building relationships and closing deals.\n\n\n\n",
