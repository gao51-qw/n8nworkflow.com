### **How It Works**
1. **Triggering the Workflow**:
   - The workflow can be triggered manually using the **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node or automatically via the **Schedule Trigger** node, which runs the workflow at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The **Get new product** node retrieves data from a Google Sheets document containing the URLs of the model image, the clothing product image, and the WooCommerce product ID. The document also includes a column for the resulting virtual try-on image URL, which is initially empty.

3. **Setting Up the Request**:
   - The **Set data** node prepares the data for the AI request by assigning the model image URL and the product image URL to variables.

4. **AI Image Generation**:
   - The **Create Image** node sends a request to API to generate a virtual try-on image. The request includes the URLs of the model and the clothing product.
When you register for the API service you will get 1$ for free. For continuous work add API credits to your account.

5. **Image Retrieval**:
   - The **Get Url image** node retrieves the URL of the generated virtual try-on image.
   - The **Get File image** node downloads the generated image from the provided URL.

6. **Image Storage**:
   - The **Upload Image** node uploads the generated image to a specified Google Drive folder for storage.

7. **Updating Google Sheets**:
   - The **Update result** node updates the Google Sheets document with the URL of the generated virtual try-on image.

8. **Updating WooCommerce**:
   - The **Update product** node updates the corresponding product in WooCommerce by adding the generated virtual try-on image to the product's image gallery.
