## Automated Weekly Newsletter with AI Research, Editorial Drafting, and Approval Flow

This n8n template demonstrates how to automate the full production cycle of a professional weekly newsletter. It combines AI-powered market research, editorial drafting, compliance validation, and an approval loop — all before creating a final Gmail draft ready for distribution.

Use cases are many:
- Wealth managers sending weekly market updates to clients
- Startups producing recurring research digests
- Teams creating automated newsletters for marketing or content distribution

### Good to know

- At time of writing, each AI call (research, editorial, QC) consumes API tokens from Perplexity and OpenAI. See provider pricing for updated info.
- Gmail integration requires OAuth setup with your account.
- You can adapt the prompts to any domain — from finance to tech to education.

## How it works

- Schedule Trigger runs every week and sets the date window.
- Research LLM fetches structured JSON market data using Perplexity.
- Editorial LLM transforms research into a polished ~2,000 word client-ready newsletter.
- QC LLM validates factual accuracy and compliance risks before approval.
- Preview Email is sent with Approve/Revise buttons. Clicking opens a secure n8n-hosted approval form.
- Final Draft Creation: Once approved, the workflow generates a clean Gmail draft, ready to send.

## How to use

- Replace the demo schedule trigger with your own (weekly, daily, or event-based).
- Set up Gmail OAuth credentials to enable email previews and final drafts.
- Update branding (logo, disclaimer, signature) in the HTML builder node.
- Adjust prompts to your audience — e.g., simplify tone for marketing, or keep institutional tone for financial clients.

## Requirements

- Perplexity account for research API (or your LLM of choice)
- OpenAI for editorial and QC steps (or your LLM of choice)
- Gmail account with OAuth credentials
- Optional: your own domain to host the approval webhook

## Customising this workflow

This workflow can be extended beyond financial newsletters. Try:
- Content marketing: Automate weekly digests or trend reports
- Education: Generate curriculum summaries with approval loops for teachers
- Internal comms: Automate compliance-checked company updates
