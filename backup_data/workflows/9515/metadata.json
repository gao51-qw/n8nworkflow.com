  "description": "This workflow streamlines your lead management process by automatically capturing form submissions from **Jotform**, updating **Attio CRM**, and notifying your **team (sales team for example) via Slack** — all without manual work.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Receive Lead:**\n- A new submission is captured from Jotform (name, email, message).\n\n2. **Prepare CRM:**\n- Checks if the `Pending` and `Urgent` deal stages exist in Attio CRM and creates them if they don’t exist.\n- Checks if the `Message` column exists in Attio CRM and creates it if it doesn't exist.\n\n3. **Lead Handling:**\n- If the lead **doesn't exist** in Attio CRM, the contact is created, a new deal is added to the `Pending` stage, and a Slack notification is sent.\n- If the lead **exists but has no deal**, a new deal is added to `Pending`, and Slack is notified.\n- If the **lead exists with a deal**, the deal is moved to the `Urgent` stage, and Slack is notified.\n\n4. **Slack Notification:**\n- Your team (sales team for example) receives an instant Slack message whenever a new or existing lead is processed, so they can act fast.\n\n\n## Requirements\nMake sure to have **Jotform**, **Attio CRM** and **Slack** accounts, then follow this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCGmVZsGYWk) on how to start using this template.",
