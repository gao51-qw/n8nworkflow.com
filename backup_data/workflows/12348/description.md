# Create curated industry trend reports from Medium to Google Docs

This workflow automates the process of market research by generating high-quality, curated digests of Medium articles for specific topics. It scrapes recent content, uses AI to filter out spam and duplicates, categorizes the stories into readable buckets, and compiles everything into a formatted Google Doc report.

## Target Audience
Content marketers, market researchers, product managers, and investors looking to track industry trends without reading through noise.

## How it works
1. **Schedule**: The workflow runs on a defined schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) via the **Schedule Trigger**.
2. **Define Source**: A **Set** node defines the specific Medium tag URL to track (e.g., `/tag/artificial-intelligence`).
3. **Scrape Content**: **BrowserAct** visits the target Medium page and scrapes the latest article titles, authors, and summaries.
4. **Analyze & Filter**: An **AI Agent** (powered by Claude via OpenRouter) analyzes the raw feed. It removes duplicates, filters out spam/clickbait, and categorizes high-quality stories into buckets (e.g., "Must Reads," "Engineering," "Wealth").
5. **Create Report**: A **Google Docs** node creates a new document using the digest title generated by the AI.
6. **Build Document**: The workflow loops through the analyzed items, appending headers and body text to the Google Doc section by section.
7. **Notify Team**: A **Slack** node sends a message to your chosen channel confirming the report is ready.

## How to set up
1. **Configure Credentials**: Connect your **BrowserAct**, **Google Docs**, **Slack**, and **OpenRouter** accounts in n8n.
2. **Prepare BrowserAct**: Ensure the **Automated Industry Trend Scraper & Outline Creator** template is saved in your BrowserAct account.
3. **Set Target Topic**: Open the **Target Page** node and replace the `Target_Medium_Link` with the Medium tag archive you wish to track (e.g., `https://medium.com/tag/bitcoin/archive`).
4. **Configure Notification**: Open the **Send a message** node (Slack) and select the channel where you want to receive alerts.
5. **Activate**: Turn the workflow on.

## Requirements
* **BrowserAct** account with the **Automated Industry Trend Scraper & Outline Creator** template.
* **Google Docs** account.
* **Slack** account.
* **OpenRouter** account (or any compatible LLM credentials).

## How to customize the workflow
1. **Adjust the AI Persona**: Modify the system prompt in the **Analyzer & Script writer** node to change the categorization buckets (e.g., change "Engineering" to "Marketing Strategies").
2. **Change the Output Destination**: Replace the Google Docs nodes with **Notion** or **Airtable** nodes if you prefer a database format over a document.
3. **Add Email Delivery**: Add a **Gmail** or **Outlook** node at the end to email the finished Google Doc link directly to stakeholders.
