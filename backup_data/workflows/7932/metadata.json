  "description": "![Post Facebook.png](fileId:2211)\n## Overview\nThis template allows you to **automatically post messages from Telegram directly to Facebook** using **Airtop no-code browser automation**.  \nIt is designed for creators, social media managers, and businesses that want to streamline their cross-posting workflow without coding.\n\n## Why this is valuable\nManually copying messages from Telegram to Facebook can be time-consuming and error-prone. With this automation:\n- Every Telegram message you send to your bot can instantly appear on Facebook.  \n- You save time, reduce repetitive manual work, and ensure consistent messaging across platforms.  \n- Perfect for **community managers, marketing teams, and content creators** who want to grow their Facebook presence while engaging Telegram followers.\n\n## How it works\n1. A **Telegram Trigger** listens for incoming messages to your bot.  \n2. **Airtop** starts a browser session and opens Facebook.  \n3. The bot **clicks into the composer**, types your Telegram message, and presses **Publish**.  \n4. (Optional) It can also tag followers or add extra text.  \n5. Finally, Telegram sends you a **confirmation**: “✅ Facebook: post published.”\n\n## Setup\n- Connect your **Telegram Bot** credentials.  \n- Add your **Airtop API key/account**.  \n- On first run, log in to Facebook inside Airtop (it will reuse the session later).  \n\n## Customization\n- Change selectors or text if your Facebook interface differs.  \n- Add more automation steps (like attaching images, tagging pages, or posting into groups).  \n- Adjust **Wait** nodes if your connection is slower.\n\n\n",
