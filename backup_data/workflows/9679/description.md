### AI Email Manager: Auto Summary, Labeling, and CRM Logging via n8n + Gemini

### Overview

This workflow turns your Gmail inbox into a fully autonomous AI Email Agent that reads, summarizes, categorizes, and organizes emails in real-time.
Built with n8n, Google Gemini, Notion, and Google Sheets, it’s perfect for founders, freelancers, and agencies who receive a ton of emails daily and want to automate the triage process without losing control.

##### How It Works

1. Gmail Trigger — Detects new incoming emails.

2. Process Email Data — Extracts sender info, subject, and content in a clean structured format.

3. AI Email Analyzer — Uses Gemini AI to summarize the email and decide the most relevant label (e.g., Project Updates, Client Requests, Invoices, etc.).

4. Create Gmail Label (if not exists) — Dynamically creates a new label if the AI recommends one that doesn’t exist.

5. AI Agent + Add Label to Email — Applies the correct Gmail label automatically using the message ID.

6. Logs in Notion & Google Sheets — Every processed email (summary, sender, date, label) is logged for tracking and analytics.
