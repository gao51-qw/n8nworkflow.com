  "description": "### 🧑‍💼 Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is for **any YouTube user** who wants to **bulk delete all playlists** from their own channel — whether to start fresh, clean up old content, or prepare the account for a new purpose.\n\nIt’s useful for:\n\n* Creators reorganizing their channel\n* People transferring content to another account\n* Anyone who wants to avoid deleting playlists manually one by one\n\n### 🧠 What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nYouTube does not offer a built-in way to delete multiple playlists at once. If you have dozens or hundreds of playlists, removing them manually is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThis workflow **automates the entire deletion process** in seconds, saving you hours of repetitive effort.\n\n### ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\n* Connects to your YouTube account\n* Fetches **all playlists** you’ve created (excluding system playlists)\n* **Deletes them one by one** automatically\n\n&gt; ⚠️ This action is **irreversible**. Once a playlist is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Use with caution.\n\n### 🛠️ Setup\n\n1. 🔐 **Create a YouTube OAuth2 credential** in n8n for your channel.\n2. 🧭 Assign the credential to both YouTube nodes.\n3. ✅ Click **“Test workflow”** to execute.\n\n&gt; 🟨 By default, this workflow deletes everything. If you want to be more selective, see the customization tips below.\n\n### 🧩 How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n* ✅ **Add a confirmation flag**\n  Insert a `Set` node with a custom field like `confirm_delete = true`, and follow it with an `IF` node to prevent accidental execution.\n\n* ✂️ **Delete only some playlists**\n  Add a `Filter` node after fetching playlists — you can match by title, ID, or keyword (e.g. only delete playlists containing “old”).\n\n* 🛑 **Add a pause before deletion**\n  Insert a `Wait` or `NoOp` node to give you a moment to cancel before it runs.\n\n* 🔁 **Adapt to scheduled cleanups**\n  Use a `Cron` trigger if you want to periodically clear temporary playlists.",
