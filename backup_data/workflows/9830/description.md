## Description:
Bridge the gap between Monday.com and Jira with this intelligent n8n automation template.

The workflow listens for new or updated Monday.com items, normalizes data fields, and syncs them with your Jira backlog—automatically detecting duplicates using fuzzy matching logic. It then creates or updates Jira issues accordingly and logs the results back into Monday.com, ensuring your product and engineering teams stay aligned in real time.
Ideal for project managers, product ops, and agile teams who manage intake in Monday.com but execute tasks in Jira.

## ✅ What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)
- 🌐 Webhook Trigger from Monday.com: Starts automatically whenever a new task or update occurs in Monday.com.
- 🔄 Normalize Monday.com Data: Extracts and cleans key data fields such as summary, component, severity, and description for consistent formatting before sending to Jira.
- 📊 Query Jira Backlog: Fetches all existing issues from Jira to establish a baseline for duplicate detection.
- 🔍 Detect Duplicates with Fuzzy Matching: Compares Monday item titles with Jira summaries using character-level similarity (&gt;80% threshold) to detect potential duplicates even with minor variations.
- ⚖️ Decision Gate: Duplicate or New: If duplicate found: updates the existing Jira issue with new data.
- If no match: creates a new Jira task in the appropriate project and issue type.
- 🔧 Update Existing Jira Issues: Automatically enhances Jira tickets with latest information from Monday.com including updated priority, description, and reference links.
- ✨ Create New Jira Issues: For new requests, generates a Jira task with details mapped from Monday—complete with severity, component, and description.
- 📝 Log Actions Back to Monday.com: Posts an update back to the originating Monday item confirming whether the action created or updated a Jira issue, including timestamp and Jira key link.
- 📋 (Optional) Create New Monday Board: Can also auto-create a private board in Monday.com for project-specific task organization.
