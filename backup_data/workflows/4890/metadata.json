  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nThis subworkflow is ideal for developers and automation builders working with UniPile and n8n to automate message enrichment and LinkedIn lead routing.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nUniPile separates personal and organization accounts into two different API endpoints. This flow handles both intelligently so you're not missing sender context due to API quirks or bad assumptions.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\nThis subworkflow is used by:\n\n- **[LinkedIn Auto Message Router with Request Detection](#)**  \n- **[LinkedIn AI Response Generator with Slack Approval](#)**\n\nIt receives a message sender ID and tries to enrich it using UniPile's `/people` and `/organizations` endpoints. It returns a clean, consistent profile object regardless of which source was used.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Generate a UniPile API token and save it in your n8n credentials\n2. Make sure this subworkflow is triggered correctly by your parent flows\n3. Test both people and organization lookups to verify responses are normalized\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Add a secondary enrichment layer using tools like Clearbit or FullContact\n- Customize the fallback logic or error handling\n- Expand the returned data for more AI context or user routing (e.g., job title, region)\n",
