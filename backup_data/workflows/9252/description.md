# Email List Hygiene - Automated Weekly Validator

## Overview

Validates email lists through automated checks, categorizes results as Valid/Invalid/Risky, updates Google Sheets in real-time, and delivers HTML reports. Runs every Friday at 5 PM via cron scheduling.

---

## Workflow Architecture

```
Schedule Trigger → Read Google Sheets → Loop (Process Each Email)
    → Validate API → IF Branch (Valid/Invalid)
    → Update Google Sheets → Merge → Loop Back
    → Calculate Statistics → Send Email Report
```

### Loop Mechanism
- Split in Batches processes one email at a time
- Each email: validate → branch → update sheet → merge → continue
- Loop accumulates all results internally
- "Done" output triggers statistics calculation after all emails processed

### Health Score Formula
```
Score = (Valid% × 100) - (Invalid% × 20) - (Risky% × 10)
Bounded: 0-100
```

**Ranges:**
- 80-100: Excellent (green)
- 60-79: Good (orange)  
- 0-59: Needs Attention (red)

## Setup

### 1. Import Template
Import JSON file to n8n via Workflows → Add workflow → Import from File

### 2. Configure Credentials

**Google Sheets OAuth2** (used by 3 nodes):
- Create credential via any Google Sheets node
- Grant spreadsheet permissions
- Apply same credential to all Google Sheets nodes

**Validation API:**
- Get API key from https://verifi.email
- Add credential to "Validate Email Address" node

**Gmail OAuth2:**
- Add credential to "Send Weekly Report" node
- Grant email sending permissions

### 3. Connect Google Sheet

In all three Google Sheets nodes:
- Select your spreadsheet from Document dropdown
- Select sheet tab
- Verify "Column to Match On" = row_number (for Update nodes)

### 4. Set Email Recipient

In "Send Weekly Report" node:
- Change "Send To" from placeholder to your email
- Optional: Add CC/BCC for multiple recipients

### 5. Test

- Add 3-5 test emails (mix of valid/invalid)
- Click "Execute Workflow"
- Verify sheet updates and email arrives

### 6. Activate

Toggle "Active" switch. Workflow runs automatically every Friday at 5 PM.

## Customization

**Change Schedule:**
Edit "Weekly Schedule" node cron expression:
- Daily 9 AM: `0 9 * * *`
- Monday 5 PM: `0 17 * * 1`
- First of month: `0 9 1 * *`

**Email Design:**
Edit HTML in "Send Weekly Report" message field. Modify colors (search hex codes), text, or add branding.

**Archive Invalid Emails:**
Add Google Sheets Append node after "Update Invalid Status" → create "Invalid_Archive" tab → append email, name, reason, date

**Slack Notifications:**
Add Slack node after email report → configure channel → use summary text from statistics

**Rate Limiting:**
Add Wait node (1-2 seconds) after validation for large lists to prevent API throttling

## Troubleshooting

**"Column not found":**
Verify exact column names in sheet: `row_number`, `name`, `email`, `status`, `checked_at`, `notes` (case-sensitive)

**Only processes 1 email:**
Check Google Sheets node Range field is empty or set to include all rows. Verify "Use Header Row" enabled.

**Wrong statistics:**
Enable "Execute Once" in Calculate Statistics node settings (gear icon)

**Email not arriving:**
Check spam/promotions folder, verify Gmail credential authorized, confirm recipient address correct

**API errors:**
Verify API key valid, check quota not exceeded, test with simple email like test@gmail.com

**Merge node error:**
Confirm both Update nodes connect to Merge inputs (top and bottom). Check both branches execute successfully.

## Validation Checks

Each email undergoes:
- RFC 5322 format compliance
- MX record existence (domain has mail servers)
- SMTP verification (mailbox exists)
- Disposable email service detection
- Catch-all domain detection

**Categories:**
- Valid: All checks passed
- Invalid: Critical checks failed
- Risky: Disposable or catch-all domain

## Support

Check execution logs in n8n Executions tab for errors. Use "Execute Node" on individual nodes to isolate issues. Visit n8n community forum for additional help.
