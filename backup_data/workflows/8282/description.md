**Description:**

Never leave your leads waiting! This n8n workflow template ensures every inquiry gets a timely and professional response—whether it’s business hours or after hours. By checking submission times, the automation sends tailored email replies, updates your team instantly, and ensures no lead goes unnoticed.

This workflow monitors a Google Sheet for new form responses, waits briefly to capture complete data, checks if the submission falls within business hours, and then sends either a standard business reply or a polite after-hours acknowledgment. Additionally, it alerts your team via Telegram with lead details for quick follow-up. Perfect for sales, support, and operations teams managing inbound leads.

**Features**

📧 Sends automated Gmail replies (business hours vs. after-hours messaging)
📲 Notifies your team instantly on Telegram with lead details
🌟 Fully automated: hands-free lead acknowledgment + team alerts

**Setup Instructions**

Google Sheets Setup

  - Phone Number
  - Message
  - Submission Time (timestamp)
- Connect your sheet to n8n using Google Sheets credentials.

Gmail Setup
- Connect your Gmail account in n8n credentials.
- Prepare two email templates:
  - Business Hours Reply: “Hi {{Name}}, thank you for reaching out! Our team will get back to you shortly.”
  - After-Hours Reply: “Hi {{Name}}, thank you for contacting us! Our team will get back to you tomorrow.”

Telegram Setup
- Create a Telegram bot via @BotFather.
- Add your bot to the target group or chat.
- Store the bot token and chatId securely in n8n credentials.

Workflow Configuration

- Replace hardcoded values with n8n credential references.

**Customization**

⏰ Business Hours: Adjust the time window (e.g., 8 AM–8 PM, Mon–Sat) in the workflow logic.
📧 Email Templates: Personalize subject lines, add signatures, or include links to resources.

✅ Restrict credential access to authorized team members.
