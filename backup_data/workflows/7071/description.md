# Lead Enrichment & Email Discovery from Google Sheets

## What this workflow does
This template automates the enrichment of business leads from a Google Sheet by:
* Triggering when a row is activated
* Searching for company information with Serper.dev
* Generating and validating potential contact pages
* Scraping company pages with ScrapingBee
* Extracting emails and updating the sheet
* Marking rows as finished
---
## Prerequisites
* Google Sheet with columns: `business type`, `city`, `state`, `activate`
* **Copy the ready-to-use template:**

## How to customize the workflow
* **Send `country`, `country_code`, and `result_count` from the sheet:**
  Add these as columns in your sheet and update the workflow to read their values dynamically, making your search fully configurable per row.
* **Add more blacklist terms:**
  Update the code node with additional company names or keywords you want to exclude from the search results.
* **Extract more contact details:**
  Modify the email extraction code to find other contact info (like phone numbers or social profiles) if needed.
