# 🚨 Emergency Alerts Reporter to iMessage

This n8n template fetches real-time emergency incident alerts from PulsePoint for a specific agency and delivers them directly to any phone number via iMessage using the Blooio API. It's designed to keep users informed with clear, AI-summarized reports of emergency activity near them—automatically and reliably.

Use cases are powerful and immediate:  
- Get real-time fire/medical alerts for your neighborhood.  
- Use it for family, local safety groups, or even emergency response teams.  
- Convert technical dispatch data into readable updates with emojis and plain English.

## 🧠 Good to Know

- You’ll need a **PulsePoint agency ID** (see instructions below).  
- iMessages are sent using [Blooio’s API](https://blooio.com) (which supports Apple’s iMessage and fallback RCS/SMS).  
- Messages are AI-enhanced using OpenAI's `o4-mini` model to summarize incident reports with context and urgency.  
- The workflow runs every hour, but this can be configured to match your needs.  
- Each report is sent **only once**, thanks to persistent tracking of seen incident IDs in workflow static memory.

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Trigger**: A Schedule Trigger (every hour) or manual start kicks off the flow.  
2. **Get Alerts**: A `code` node fetches the latest PulsePoint incidents for a specified agency and decrypts the data.  
3. **Filter New Incidents**: We store previously seen incident IDs to prevent duplicate alerts.  
4. **Merge Incidents**: All new incident details are merged into a single payload.  
5. **Condition Check**: If there are no new incidents, nothing is sent.  
6. **AI Summary**: The incident data is passed to an AI agent for summarization with human-friendly emojis and formatting.  
7. **Send Message**: The final summary is sent via Blooio’s API to your phone using iMessage.
