This **n8n workflow** enables teams to automate and standardize multi-step onboarding or messaging workflows using **Google Sheets**, **Forms**, **Gmail**, and dynamic logic powered by **Code** and **Switch** nodes. It ensures the right email is sent at the right step, tracks progress in Google Sheets, and handles errors or escalations.

## **⚙️ What this workflow does**

1. **Trigger via Form or Manual Execution**
    
    - Users can fill a web form or run the workflow manually.
        
    
2. **Read Google Sheets**
    
    - Retrieves step definitions and user progress from two sheets:
        
        - One for message templates
            
        - One for user step/status tracking
            
        
    
3. **Generate Message Table**
    
    - Uses custom JavaScript to parse and structure message templates based on step and message type (sent, completed, error).
        
    
4. **Determine User Step**
    
    - A **Switch node** checks the user’s current step and status.
        
    - Logic branches into the correct flow for message sending and verification.
        
    
5. **Send Message**
    
    - Message variables are replaced using a **Code** node.
        
    - Final message is sent via Gmail or another workflow (using Execute Workflow).
        
    
6. **Update Sheets**
    
    - Marks the step as completed or passed.
        
    - Creates the next step in the sheet with updated status.
        
    
7. **Handle Errors**
    
    - If the step fails, an error message is sent to the responsible admin.

## **🛠️ Setup**

1. **Connect Google Sheets and Gmail**:
    
    - Ensure credentials are configured in n8n.
        
    
2. **Prepare Sheets**:
    
    - One sheet for messages with steps/types/subjects/content. You can copy the one from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_fUSV9zJo8Ya6ulvCOon2wjoeEmOwDFrpK1Xxa9gmw/edit?usp=sharing)
        
    - One sheet for tracking users and their current step/status. You can copy the one from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBLJNt8hAXNkqj6lfwQilBr9FCRxjT3j0r0Ni6cgoYA/edit?usp=sharing)
        
    
3. **Customize Webform**:
    
    - Use the provided form to capture First Name, Last Name, and Email.
        
    
4. **Connect to Your Email Templates**:
    
    - Ensure your message structure follows the expected JSON format by step and type.
