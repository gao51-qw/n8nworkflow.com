   - Identify the **cheapest NFT listings** by collection or token ID.  
   - Track the **highest offer** made for a single NFT.  
   - Access **detailed order history** for a transaction.  
3. The **OpenSea API** *(requires API key)* is queried to fetch real-time data.  
4. **The AI engine processes and structures the response**, making it easy to interpret.  
5. The **NFT marketplace insights are delivered via Telegram, Slack, or stored in a database**.
