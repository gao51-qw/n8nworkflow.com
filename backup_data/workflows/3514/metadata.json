  "description": "Learn how to build an MCP Server and Client in n8n with official nodes.\n\n&gt; ⚠ Requires n8n version 1.88.0 or higher.\n\nIn this example, we use Google Calendar and custom functions as two separate MCP Servers, demonstrating how to integrate both native and custom tools.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe AI Agent connects to two MCP Servers. Each MCP Trigger (Server) generates a URL exposing its tools. This URL is used by an MCP Client linked to the AI Agent.\n\nWhenever you make changes to the tools, there’s no need to modify the MCP Client. It automatically keeps the AI Agent informed on how to use each tool, even if you change them over time.\n\nThat’s the power of MCP 🙌\n\n### Who is this template for\n\nAnyone looking to use MCP with their AI Agents.\n\n### How to set up\n\nInstructions are included within the workflow itself.\n\n### Check out my other templates\n\n👉 [**https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/**](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon/)",
