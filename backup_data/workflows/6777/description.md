# 🔧 Automated Video Generator (n8n Workflow)

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-End Video Creation from user idea or transcript

- AI-Powered Scriptwriting using LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek via OpenRouter)

- Voiceover Generation with customizable TTS voices

- Image Scene Generation using generative models like together.ai

- Clip Creation & Concatenation into a full video

- Dynamic Caption Generation with styling options

- Google Drive & Sheets Integration for asset storage and progress tracking


## ⚙️ How It Works
User Submits Form with:

- Main topic or transcript
- Desired duration
- TTS voice
- Visual style (e.g., Pixar, Lego, Cyberpunk)
- Image generation provider

AI generates a script: A catchy title, description, hook, full script, and CTA using a language model.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): The script is turned into audio using the selected voice, with timestamped captions generated.

Scene Segmentation: The script is split into 5–6 second segments for visual storyboarding.

Image Prompt Creation: Each scene is converted into an image prompt in the selected style (e.g., "anime close-up of a racing car").

Image Generation: Prompts are sent to together.ai or fal.ai to generate scenes.

Clip Creation: Each image is turned into a short video clip (Ken Burns-style zoom) based on script timing.

Video Assembly:

- All clips are concatenated into a single video.
- Captions are overlaid using the earlier timestamps.
- Final Output is uploaded to Google Drive, Telegram and links are saved in Google Sheets.


## 🛠 Inital Setup

### 🗣️ 1. Set Up TTS Voice (Text-to-Speech)

Run your TTS server locally using Docker.

### 🧰 2. Set Up NCA-Toolkit
The nca-toolkit appears to be a custom video/image processing backend used via HTTP APIs:

http://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/image/transform/video

http://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/video/concatenate

http://host.docker.internal:9090/v1/ffmpeg/compose

#### 🔧 Steps:
Clone or build the nca-toolkit container (if it's a private tool):

Ensure it exposes port 9090.

It should support endpoints for:

Image to video (zoom effect)

Video concatenation

Audio + video merging

Caption overlay via FFmpeg

Run it locally with Docker:

*docker run -d -p 9090:80 your-nca-toolkit-image*

### 🧠 3. Set Up together.ai (Image Generation) (Optional *You can use ChatGPT API Instead*)

This handles image generation using models like FLUX.1-schnell.

🔧 Steps:
Create an account at: https://www.together.ai

Generate your API key
