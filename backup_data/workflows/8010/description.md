## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for creating an autonomous social media manager. 
This workflow uses an AI agent to intelligently generate unique, high-quality content, check for duplicates, and post it on a consistent schedule to automate your entire Twitter presence.

## Who's this workflow for?
- Social Media Managers
- Marketing Teams & Agencies
- Startup Founders & Solopreneurs
- Content Creators

## How it works
**1. Runs on a Schedule:** The workflow automatically starts at a set interval (e.g., every 6 hours), ensuring a consistent posting schedule.

**2. AI Generates a New Tweet:** An advanced AI Agent, powered by OpenAI, uses a detailed prompt to craft a new, engaging tweet. The prompt defines the tone, topics, character limits, and hashtags.

**3. Checks for Duplicates:** Before finalizing the tweet, the AI Agent is equipped with a tool to read a Google Sheet containing a log of all previously published posts. This allows it to ensure the new content is always unique.

**4. Posts to Twitter (X):** The final, unique tweet is automatically posted to your connected Twitter account.

**5. Logs the New Post:** After posting, the workflow logs the new tweet back into the Google Sheet, updating the history for the next run. This completes the autonomous loop.

## Setup Instructions
1. Schedule Your Posts: In the Start Workflow (Schedule Trigger) node, set the frequency you want the workflow to run (e.g., every 6 hours).

2. Connect OpenAI:
- Add your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI Chat Model node.
- Customize the prompt in the AI Agent node to match your brand's voice, target keywords, and specific URLs.

3. Configure Google Sheets:

4. Connect Twitter (X):
- In the Create Tweet node, connect the Twitter account where you want to post.

5. Activate Workflow:
- Save the workflow and toggle the "Active" switch to ON. Your AI social media manager is now live!
