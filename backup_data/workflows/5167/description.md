# Automating LinkedIn Competitive Monitoring

## Use Case

Automatically track and summarize LinkedIn posts from key executives at competitor companies. This agent provides structured insights into hiring trends, product announcements, strategic shifts, and thought leadership, helping teams stay informed and responsive without manual monitoring.
