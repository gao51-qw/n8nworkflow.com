  "description": "## How it works  \nThis workflow takes a list of links from Google Sheets, visits each page, extracts the main text using [Decodo](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD), and creates a summary with the help of artificial intelligence.  \nIt helps you turn research articles or web pages into clear, structured insights you can reuse for your projects, content ideas, or newsletters.\n\n**Input:** A Google Sheet named `input` with one column called `url`.  \n**Output:** Another Google Sheet named `output`, where all the processed data is stored:  \n- **URL:** original article link  \n- **Title:** article title  \n- **Source:** website or domain  \n- **Published Date:** publication date (if found)  \n- **Main Topic:** main theme of the article  \n- **Key Ideas:** three main takeaways or insights  \n- **Summary:** short text summary  \n- **Text Type:** type of content (e.g., article, blog, research paper)\n\n## Setup steps  \n1. Connect your Google Sheets account.  \n2. Add your links to the `input` sheet.  \n3. In the **[Decodo](https://visit.decodo.com/raqXGD)** node, insert your API key.  \n4.
