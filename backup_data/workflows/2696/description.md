#  Setting Up and Generating TOTP

## Step 1: Receive QR Code and Extract the Link

**1. Receive the QR Code from the 2FA service**
After enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on services like OpenAI, Google, GitHub, etc., a QR Code will be given to you, which you need to scan. This QR Code contains the TOTP link used to generate one-time passcodes.

**2. Extract the link from the received QR Code**
To extract the link from the QR Code, use online tools. These tools will help you extract the corresponding link.

After using an online tool, the extracted link will appear in the following format:

```
otpauth://totp/ServiceName:username?secret=secret_key&issuer=ServiceName
```
For example:
```
otpauth://totp/OpenAI:amir676080@gmail.com?secret=test-test-test&issuer=OpenAI
```


## Step 2: Create TOTP Credential in n8n

1. **Create a new Credential**
To use TOTP in n8n, you need to create a new **TOTP Credential**.

2. **Enter the details in the Credential**
- **In the Secret field:** Enter the **secret key** (extracted from the QR Code link). 
For example:
```
 test-test-test
```

- **In the Label field:** Enter **ServiceName:username** 
For example:
```
OpenAI:amir676080@gmail.com

```

After entering the information, click Save to save the Credential.

## Step 3: Get the TOTP Code
**Click on Test Workflow**
After setting up the credentials in n8n, click on Test, and the corresponding code will be delivered to you.

Output:
```
[
  {
    "token": "720769",
    "secondsRemaining": 18
  }
]
