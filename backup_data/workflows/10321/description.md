## Who is this for?
This n8n workflow is designed for businesses, customer support teams, and page administrators who want to automate their Facebook Messenger responses while maintaining the ability to escalate to human agents when needed. It's perfect for e-commerce stores, service providers, and organizations that receive customer inquiries through Facebook Messenger and want to provide instant, intelligent responses 24/7. The workflow can handle both text messages and attachments, automatically detects when human intervention is needed, and seamlessly transfers the conversation to a human admin.

## What this Workflow Does
This n8n workflow creates an intelligent Facebook Messenger chatbot that can understand and respond to customer messages in both English and Bengali. It automatically classifies incoming messages to determine if they require human assistance, processes attachments by identifying file types, generates appropriate responses using AI, and escalates conversations to human admins when necessary. The workflow maintains conversation context through memory and can reference external documents for more accurate responses.
