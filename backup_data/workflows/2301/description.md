## How it works
- it will return workflows that have buil-in nodes not of latest version with information of node name, type, current version and latest version for that type

## Set up steps:
- You need to have n8n credentials set, you can get n8n API key under settings
- set your instance base URL in "instance base url" node

### Disclaimar:
Only check build-in nodes, community nodes are not supported
