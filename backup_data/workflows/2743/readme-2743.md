## 🧠 Description
This n8n workflow enables seamless automation of real-time chat replies in **Telegram** by integrating with **Google Gemini's Chat Model**. Every time a user sends a message to your Telegram bot, the workflow routes it through the Gemini AI, which analyzes and crafts a professional response. This reply is then automatically delivered back to the user.

The setup acts as a lightweight but powerful chatbot system — ideal for businesses, customer service, or even personal productivity bots. You can easily modify its tone, intelligence level, or logging mechanisms to cater to specific domains such as sales, tech support, or general Q&A.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Workflow
The primary goal of this workflow is to **automate intelligent, context-aware chat responses in Telegram** using a robust AI model. It eliminates manual reply handling, enhances user engagement, and ensures 24/7 interaction capabilities — all through a no-code or low-code setup using n8n.
