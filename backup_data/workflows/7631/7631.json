It's perfect for businesses looking to provide 24/7 customer assistance for hosting plans, domain services, and technical support while maintaining a professional, human-like interaction experience.\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow creates an **AI-powered customer support chatbot** that provides comprehensive assistance for web hosting and domain services. The AI agent (named Matt) automatically:\n\n1. **Receives customer queries** through a webhook endpoint\n2. **Captures customer information** (name and email) at the start of each session\n3. **Processes natural language requests** using Google Gemini AI\n4. **Accesses real-time information** from multiple Google Sheets knowledge bases:\n   - Shared Hosting Plans (pricing, features, specifications)\n   - Domain Prices (registration, transfer, renewal costs)\n   - Hosting Features (technical capabilities and specifications)\n   - FAQs (common questions and answers)\n   - Payment Method Details (accepted payment options)\n   - Company Offerings (available products and services)\n5. **Checks domain availability** via WHMCS API integration\n6. **Provides accurate, contextual responses** based on the knowledge base\n7. **Maintains conversation history** with session-based memory\n8. **Stores complete chat sessions** in Google Sheets for analysis and follow-up\n\nThe system ensures **100% accuracy** by only providing information that exists in the knowledge base, eliminating guesswork and maintaining brand consistency.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1.

Set up Chat Storage\n- Create a Google Sheet for storing chat inquiries\n- Update the document ID and credentials in the Chat_Inquiries node\n- This will automatically store all customer conversations for analysis\n\n### 5. Deploy the Webhook\n- The workflow creates a unique webhook endpoint for receiving customer queries\n- Use this endpoint URL in your customer-facing application or chat interface\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Google Sheets account** with the knowledge base set up\n- **Google Gemini API account** with appropriate credentials\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n- **WHMCS installation** (optional, for domain availability checking)\n- **Web hosting or domain services business**\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify AI Agent Behavior\n- Edit the system message in the AI Agent node to change the bot's personality and response style\n- Adjust response length and tone to match your brand voice\n- Customize the agent's name (currently \"Matt\")\n\n### Enhance Knowledge Base\n- Add more Google Sheets tools for additional information sources\n- Include product catalogs, pricing tables, or technical documentation\n- Add multi-language support for international customers\n\n### Improve Customer Experience\n- Add domain suggestion algorithms based on customer input\n- Integrate with your existing customer database for personalized recommendations\n- Add notification systems (email, Slack, SMS) for high-value inquiries\n\n### Security Enhancements\n- Implement API key rotation and monitoring\n- Add request validation and sanitization\n- Set up usage analytics and abuse prevention\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Real-time information access** from Google Sheets knowledge base\n- **AI-powered natural language processing** for customer queries\n- **Session-based memory** for contextual conversations\n- **Automatic domain availability checking** via WHMCS API\n- **Professional, customer-focused responses** that maintain brand standards\n- **Complete chat history storage** for analysis and follow-up\n- **Scalable webhook architecture** for high-volume usage\n- **Multi-tool integration** for comprehensive customer support\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **24/7 customer support automation** for web hosting companies\n- **Sales team assistance** with real-time product information\n- **Customer self-service portals** with intelligent assistance\n- **Lead generation** through proactive service recommendations\n- **Customer retention** via improved support experience\n- **Support ticket reduction** by handling common queries automatically\n\n## Chat Session Management\n\nThe workflow automatically manages chat sessions with the following features:\n\n- **Unique Session IDs** for each customer conversation\n- **Automatic customer information capture** (name and email)\n- **Conversation history tracking** with chronological message storage\n- **Session persistence** across multiple interactions\n- **Data export** to Google Sheets for analysis and follow-up\n\n## Example Customer Interactions\n\nThe AI agent can handle various customer scenarios:\n\n- **Hosting Plan Inquiries**: Detailed information about shared hosting plans, features, and pricing\n- **Domain Services**: Domain availability checking, pricing, and registration guidance\n- **Technical Support**: Feature explanations, setup guidance, and troubleshooting\n- **Payment Information**: Accepted payment methods and transaction processes\n- **General Support**: Company information, service offerings, and FAQ responses\n\nThis template transforms your web hosting business by providing instant, accurate customer support while maintaining the personal touch that customers expect from professional service providers.

              "systemMessage": "=You are an AI-powered customer support assistant for a web hosting company. Your name is Matt. Your role is to provide accurate, helpful, and friendly answers to customer queries regarding company’s services, based strictly on the provided knowledge base and tools.\n\nCore Responsibilities:\n1. Assist customers with information about shared hosting plans, domain prices, hosting features, FAQs, and payment methods.\n2. Always use the provided Google Sheets tools to fetch the latest information when available instead of guessing.\n3. Respond concisely but with enough detail to fully answer the customer’s question.\n4. Maintain a professional, approachable, and customer-focused tone.\n\nKnowledge Sources & Tools:\n- **Offerings** → Details of products and services offered.\n- **Shared_Hosting_Plans** → Details of hosting plans, pricing, and specifications.\n- **Domain_Prices** → Domain registration, transfer, and renewal prices.\n- **Hosting_Features** → Technical features and capabilities of hosting.\n- **FAQs** → Commonly asked questions and answers.\n- **Payment_Method_Details** → Accepted payment options, instructions, and currency details.\n- **Domain_Availability_Checker** → Use this tool to check the domain name availability\n- **Chat_Inquiries** → Store all chat messages for each session.\n\nChat Data Storage Rules:\n- Each chat session is identified by a unique **Session ID**.\n- In the **Chat_Inquiries** Google Sheet:\n  - The **first column** contains the Session ID.\n  - The **second column** contains the Name.\n  - The **third column** contains the Email.\n  - Subsequent columns store the conversation chronologically:\n    - Column 4 = First message from user.\n    - Column 5 = First reply from chatbot.\n    - Column 6 = Next user message.\n    - Column 7 = Next chatbot reply.\n    - Continue appending messages to the next available column for the same Session ID.\n- Never overwrite existing messages — always append in the next empty column for that row (session).\n\nGuidelines:\n- Let the user send the Name and email first , only then reply to the first message when both are received,\n- Always verify facts from the knowledge base before answering.\n- If information is not found in the sheets, politely inform the user and avoid making up details.\n- If the asked product or services are not present in teh Offering tool, tell the user that we do not offer these products or srvices.\n- Provide step-by-step guidance when explaining processes (e.g., how to order hosting, how to pay).\n- Be proactive — if the user’s question implies they might need related information (e.g., asking about hosting features might also need plan pricing), offer it in the same response.\n- Use a clear structure: introduce the answer, present the details, and end with an offer for further help.\n- Avoid overly technical jargon unless the user is clearly experienced.\n- Do not mention that you are an AI/Virtual assistant in your chat replys.\n- Do not provide names of teh tools or refrence them in your chat replys.\n- Add some delay in sending thr response to mimic the behavoiur of human typing.\n- Do not use steric sign(*) to style the reply (i.e., *   **.com:** PKR 4444 for 1 Year ).
