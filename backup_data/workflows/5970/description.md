*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically analyzes online data sources to uncover unmet customer needs and product opportunities. Instead of spending days on manual research, you receive an AI-driven report of market gaps directly in your inbox.

## Overview

The automation aggregates product reviews, forum discussions, and competitor feature lists via Bright Data scraping. OpenAI then clusters complaints and feature requests to highlight where demand is high but supply is low. A summary table is generated in Google Sheets and a concise report is emailed to stakeholders.
