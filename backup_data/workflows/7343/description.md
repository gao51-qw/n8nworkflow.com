How it works
This Lead Capture & Auto-Qualification workflow transforms raw leads into qualified prospects through intelligent automation. Here's the high-level flow:
Lead Intake → Data Validation → Enrichment → Scoring → Smart Routing → CRM Integration & Notifications
The system captures leads from any source, validates the data, enriches it with company intelligence, scores based on qualification criteria, and automatically routes high-value prospects to sales while nurturing lower-priority leads.
