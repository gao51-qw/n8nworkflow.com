  "description": "# Reverse engineer short-form videos from Instagram and TikTok using Gemini AI\n\n## Who's it for\n\nContent creators, AI video enthusiasts, and digital marketers who want to analyze successful short-form videos and understand their production techniques. Perfect for anyone looking to reverse-engineer viral content or create detailed prompts for AI video generation tools like Google Veo or Sora.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis automation takes any Instagram Reel or TikTok URL and performs a forensic analysis of the video content. The workflow downloads the video, converts it to base64, and uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro vision API to generate an extremely detailed \"Generative Manifest\" - a comprehensive prompt that could be used to recreate the video with AI tools.\n\nThe analysis includes:\n- Visual medium identification (film stock, camera sensor, lens characteristics)\n- Color grading and lighting breakdown\n- Shot-by-shot deconstruction with precise timing\n- Camera movement and framing details\n- Subject description and action choreography\n- Environmental and atmospheric details\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Configure API credentials:**\n   - Add your Apify API key for video scraping\n   - Set up Google Gemini API authentication\n\n2. **Set up Slack integration (optional):**\n   - Configure Slack OAuth for result sharing\n   - Update the channel ID where results should be posted\n\n3. **Access the form:**\n   - The workflow creates a web form where you can input video URLs\n   - Form accepts both Instagram Reel and TikTok URLs\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Apify account** with API access for video scraping\n- **Google Cloud account** with Gemini API enabled\n- **Slack workspace** (optional, for sharing results)\n- Videos must be publicly accessible (no private accounts)\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Modify the analysis prompt:** Edit the \"set_base_prompt\" node to adjust the depth and focus of the video analysis\n- **Add different platforms:** Extend the switch node to handle other video platforms\n- **Integrate with other tools:** Replace Slack with email, Discord, or other notification systems",
