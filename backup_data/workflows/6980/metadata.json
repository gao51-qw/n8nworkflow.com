  "description": "## n8n Placeholdarr for Plex (BETA)\n\n This flow creates **dummy files** for every item added in your *Arrs (Radarr/Sonarr) with the tag `unprocessed-dummy`.\n\nIt’s useful for maintaining a large Plex library **without needing the actual movies or shows to be present on your Debrid provider**.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n- When a dummy file is played, the corresponding item is automatically **monitored in *Arr** and added to the download queue.\n- This ensures that the content becomes available within **~3 minutes** for playback.\n- If the content finishes downloading **while the dummy is still being played**, **Tautulli** triggers a webhook that **stops the stream** and notifies the user.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Each n8n node must have the correct **URL** and **authorization headers** configured.\n- The **SSH host** (used to create dummy files) must have **FFmpeg** installed.\n- A **Trakt.TV API key** is required if you're using **Trakt collections**.\n\n---\n\n### Warning\n\n&gt; ⚠️ This flow is currently in **BETA** and under active development.  \n&gt; It is **not recommended** for users without technical experience.  \n&gt; Keep an eye on the GitHub repository for updates.\n\nhttps://github.com/arjanterheegde/n8n-workflows-for-plex",
