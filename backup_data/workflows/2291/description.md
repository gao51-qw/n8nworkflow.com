## Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **Marketing** and pre-**Sales** to get prospects from a form like Tally, decline data in the famous opensource CRM (SuiteCRM), synchronize contact in Brevo with linking the id from CRM, and then notify in NextCloud.

Bonus : validate email with ++CaptainVerify++ and notify in NextCloud depending on response

## How it works
For each submission in the form, a webhook is triggered.
A check of the email is done with CaptainVerify. Depending on the response, and if it is ok, then a Lead is created in SuiteCRM. Else, a message in your selected discussion is sent.
As the lead has been created, we can create a contact in Brevo (for future campain), ank link this contact with the lead_id from the CRM in a dedicated field.
Finaly, a message in your selected discussion in NextCloud informs you about the lead.

## Set up instructions
Complete the Set up credentials step when you first open the workflow. You'll need a CaptainVerify account (Api Key), a dedicated SuiteCRM user with Oauth, a Brevo account (Api Key) and a Nextcloud account.
Set up the Webhook in the form's tool of your choice (why not Tally ?).
Set each node with the explanations in sticky Notes.
Enjoy !
