Streamline your recruitment process with AI-powered resume analysis that goes beyond keyword matching.

## Overview
This workflow revolutionizes hiring by using specialized AI agents to intelligently analyze resumes for different positions. Unlike traditional ATS systems that rely on keyword matching, this solution provides deep, contextual analysis of candidate qualifications and automatically manages the entire screening process from application to response.
### How it works

Application Submission - Candidates complete a form with personal details, select their desired position (ICT, Customer Care, Accounting, or HR), and upload their resume
Secure Storage - Resumes are automatically saved to Google Drive for permanent record-keeping
Intelligent Routing - A switch node classifies applications by position and routes them to specialized AI agents
AI Analysis - Position-specific agents (each with customized prompts and guardrails) extract text from PDFs and rate candidates on a 1-10 scale with detailed commentary
CRM Integration - All data (timestamp, candidate info, position, score, AI comments, resume link) flows into Google Sheets for easy tracking
Automated Response - A secondary workflow sends interview invitations to high-scoring candidates (7-10) and professional rejection emails to others (below 7)

### Key Benefits
✅ Contextual Analysis - AI understands skills and experience, not just keywords
✅ Faster Hiring - Close applications once you have enough qualified candidates
✅ No Expertise Required - HR teams don't need technical knowledge in every field
✅ Fully Automated - From submission to interview invitation without manual intervention
✅ Customizable - Adjust AI prompts and scoring criteria for each position
✅ Transparent - All AI reasoning is logged for review
