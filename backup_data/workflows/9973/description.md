## How it works  
This workflow automates the delivery of personalized, AI-generated reports or roadmaps for new leads.  
When someone submits their information through a form, the workflow:  
1. Captures and stores the lead data.  
2. Uses an AI model to generate a customized report or roadmap.  
3. Formats the output into a professional, email-ready HTML document.  
4. Sends the report automatically to the lead via email.  
5. Optionally sends internal notifications (e.g., via chat or email) for tracking and follow-up.  

The process eliminates manual work and ensures every lead receives instant, high-quality output tailored to their input.

3. **AI Configuration** – Add your OpenAI (or compatible) API credentials and customize prompts for your desired output.  
4. **Email Setup** – Configure SMTP credentials and define sender/recipient addresses for report delivery.  
5. **Notifications** – Optionally connect a chat or messaging service (e.g., Telegram) for internal alerts.  
6. **Activation** – Test the workflow, confirm the data flow and email delivery, then activate it for live use.
