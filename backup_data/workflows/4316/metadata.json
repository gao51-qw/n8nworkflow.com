  "description": "This workflow serves as a **solid foundation** when you need an **AI Agent to return output in a specific JSON schema**, without relying on the often-unreliable **Structured Output Parser**.\n\n## What It Does\nThe example workflow takes a simple input (like a food item) and expects a JSON-formatted output containing its nutritional values.\n\n## Why Use This Instead of Structured Output Parser?\n\nThe built-in [Structured Output Parser](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/common-issues/) node is known to be unreliable when working with AI Agents.\n\nWhile the **n8n documentation recommends using a “Basic LLM Chain”** followed by a **Structured Output Parser**, this alternative workflow **completely avoids using the Structured Output Parser node**.  \nInstead, it implements a custom loop that manually validates the AI Agent's output.\n\nThis method has **proven especially reliable** with OpenAI's `gpt-4.1` series (`gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`), which tend to **produce correctly structured JSON** on the first try, as long as the **System Prompt is well defined**.\nIn this template, `gpt-4.1-nano` is set by default.\n\n### How It Works\n\nInstead of using the *Structured Output Parser*, this workflow loops the AI Agent through a manual schema validation process:\n\n- A **custom schema check** is performed after the AI Agent response.\n- A **runIndex counter** tracks the number of retries.\n- A **Switch node**:\n  - If the output does **not** match the expected schema, it routes back to the AI Agent with an updated prompt asking it to return the correct format. The process allows up to **4 retries** to avoid infinite loops.\n  - If the output **does** match the schema, it continues to a **Set node** that serves as chat response (you can customize this part to fit your use case).\n\n\nThis approach ensures schema consistency, offers flexibility, and avoids the brittleness of the default parser.\n",
