# 💰 Package Recommender with Sales Pipeline Tracking

2. **Log to Pipeline** → All inquiry data saved to tracking sheet
3. **Budget Router** → Directs to Basic ($0-3K), Standard ($3-6K), or Premium ($6K+)
4. **Set Package Variables** → Loads appropriate features, pricing, case study
5. **Send Proposal Email** → Gorgeous HTML email with personalized package details
6. **Update Pipeline** → Marks "Package Sent" and sets follow-up date (+3 days)
7. **Calendar Reminder** → Creates event in 3 days reminding you to follow up
