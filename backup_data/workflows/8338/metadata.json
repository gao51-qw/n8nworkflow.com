  "description": "## About this Workflow  \nThis workflow helps you **repurpose your YouTube videos across multiple social media platforms** with zero manual effort. It’s designed for creators, businesses, and marketers who want to maximize reach without spending hours re-uploading content everywhere.  \n\n---\n\n## How It Works  \n1. **Trigger from YouTube**  \n   - The workflow checks your YouTube channel every 10 minutes via RSS feed.  \n   - It compares the latest video ID with the last saved one to detect if a new video was uploaded.  \n   - Tutorial: [How to get YouTube Channel RSS Feed](https://chuck.is/yt-rss/#:~:text=Hit%20CTRL%2BF%20to%20pull,preferred%20RSS%20reader%20and%20rejoice.)  \n\n2. **Generate Descriptions with AI**  \n   - Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to automatically generate fresh, engaging descriptions for your posts.  \n\n3. **Create Images with ContentDrips**  \n   - ContentDrips offers multiple templates (carousel, single image, branding templates, etc.).  \n   - The workflow generates a custom promotional image using your video description and thumbnail.  \n   - Install node: `npm install n8n-nodes-contentdrips`  \n   - Docs: [ContentDrips Blog Tutorial](https://contentdrips.com/blog/2025/07/automate-content-calendar-with-n8n-and-contentdrips-api/)  \n\n4. **Publish Across Social Platforms with SocialBu**  \n   - Instead of manually connecting each social media API, this workflow uses **SocialBu**.  \n   - From a single connection, you can post to:  \n     Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter (X), LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, and more.  \n   - Website: [SocialBu](https://socialbu.com/)  \n\n5. **Get Real-Time Notifications via Discord**  \n   - After each run, the workflow sends updates to your **Discord** channel.  \n   - You’ll know if the upload was successful, or if an error occurred (e.g., API limits).  \n   - Setup guide: [Discord OAuth Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/discord/)  \n\n---\n\n## Why Use This Workflow?  \n- Saves time by **automating the entire repurposing process**.  \n- Ensures **consistent branding and visuals** across platforms.  \n- Works around platform restrictions by leveraging **SocialBu’s integrations**.  \n- Keeps you updated with **Discord notifications**—no guessing if something failed.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements  \n- YouTube channel RSS feed link  \n- ContentDrips API key, template ID, and branding setup  \n- SocialBu account with connected social media platforms  \n- Discord credentials (for webhook updates)  \n\n---\n\n## Need Help?  \nMessage me on LinkedIn: [Shayan Ali Bakhsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayan-khan20/)  \n\nHappy Automation 🚀  \n",
