**n8n Workflow Template: AI‑Powered Mental Health Support Bot**

**Overview:**
This template enables you to build a Telegram bot that delivers real‑time, empathetic mental health support. Incoming messages tagged with `#vent`, `#insight`, or `#cope` are routed to GPT‑4o via the AI/ML API, which returns tailored, compassionate responses.

**How it works:**

1. **Telegram Trigger** listens for new chat messages or voice notes.
2. **Show Typing Indicator** immediately signals “typing…” in the chat.
3. **Switch Node** examines the text prefix and routes to one of four branches (`Vent`, `Insight`, `Cope`, or default).
4. **Set Prompt** nodes build a JSON payload with a specific role‑play prompt for each branch.
5. **AI/ML API** node (model `gpt-4o`) generates the response.
6. **Telegram** node sends the AI’s answer back to the user.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Connect your **Telegram** bot token in the Telegram credentials.
2. Add your **AI/ML API** key (GPT‑4o) in n8n’s credential settings.
3. Activate the workflow and deploy your n8n instance webhook URL to BotFather.
4. Test by sending `#vent I’m stressed`, `#insight Why do I feel…`, or any tag in your Telegram chat.

This plug‑and‑play workflow brings AI‑driven emotional support directly into Telegram.
