The **🌐🤖 AI Agent Chatbot with Jina.ai Webpage Scraper** workflow is a powerful automation designed to integrate real-time web scraping capabilities into an AI-driven chatbot. Here's how it works and why it's important:

### **How It Works**  
1. **💬 Chat Trigger**: The workflow begins when a user sends a chat message, triggering the "When chat message received" node.  
2. **🧠 AI Agent Processing**: The input is passed to the "Jina.ai Web Scraping Agent," which uses advanced AI logic to interpret the user’s query and determine the information needed.  
3. **🌐 Web Scraping**: The agent utilizes the "HTTP Request" node to scrape real-time data from a user-provided URL, enabling the chatbot to fetch and analyze live website content.  
4. **🗂️ Memory Management**: The "Window Buffer Memory" node ensures context retention by storing and managing conversational history, allowing for seamless interactions.  
5. **🤖 Language Model Integration**: The scraped data is processed using the "gpt-4o-mini" language model, which generates clear, accurate, and contextually relevant responses for the user.

### **Why It's Cool**
