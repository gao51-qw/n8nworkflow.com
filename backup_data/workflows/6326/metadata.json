  "description": "It allows you to automate candidate retrieval and onboarding in your HR processes. \n\n## How it works\n- It monitors a Gmail address for new emails with a PDF attachment\n\n- It expects the PDF to be a candidate’s CV, extracts the text using OCR, and then structures the data using ChatGPT\n\n- Once the data is processed, it connects to Notion and adds (or updates) an entry in the specified database\n\n## How to use\n- Configure your Gmail account and provide your ChatGPT API key\n\n- Provide an API key for the OCR service in a variable named OCR_SPACE_API_KEY\n\n- Connect your Notion account\n\n- Once everything is configured, the workflow will monitor your inbox for new emails. Just send an email with a PDF attachment to the configured address\n\n## Requirements\n- In addition to Gmail, ChatGPT, and Notion, the system uses a third-party OCR API (OCR SPACE). You’ll need to create an account and obtain an API key\n\n- You must map the fields returned by ChatGPT to the Notion database, or use the same field names we are using\n\n## Customising\nIt should be easy to replace Notion with PostgreSQL or another database if needed\n\n",
