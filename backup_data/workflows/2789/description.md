This workflow implements the Gemini AI chat model to summarize your daily meetings and send the summary to a Slack channel daily at 9 AM (or any other time you choose).

It automatically retrieves your Google Calendar events and feeds them to the model.

The workflow uses Google’s Gemini AI for response generation.

**How it works**
- The workflow uses a Scheduled Trigger Node as the main trigger.
- The AI Agent Node uses the Google Calendar action to retrieve relevant meeting data.
- The AI Agent sends the retrieved information to the Google Gemini Chat Model (gemini-flash).
- The Google Gemini Chat Model generates a summary and informative response based on today’s meetings.
