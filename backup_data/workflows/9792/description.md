## Who’s it for
This workflow is for **system administrators** or **self-hosted n8n users** who want to **automatically check and update their n8n instance** to the latest version — with Telegram notifications for every step.

---

## How it works
1. The workflow runs **daily at 9 AM** or every time n8n starts.
2. It retrieves your **current version** using the Execute Command node.
3. It checks the **latest release** from the official n8n GitHub API.
4. It compares both versions and decides whether an update is needed.
5. If an update is available:
   - Sends a **Telegram alert**.
   - Verifies that there are **no running executions**.
   - Runs the update command safely.
   - Sends a confirmation message when done.
6. If your instance is already up to date, it sends a “latest version” message instead.

---

## Requirements
- **Self-hosted n8n** instance with access to run terminal commands.
- A valid **Telegram Bot API credential** (configured in n8n Credentials; not hardcoded).
- **SSH credentials**
To run commands on the server where n8n is installed
- **n8n API credentials**
To query running executions


---

## How to set up
1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your **Telegram Bot credential** to the Telegram nodes.
3. Adjust the **chat ID** and **message thread ID** if needed.
4. (Optional) Change the **schedule time** in the Schedule Trigger node.
5. Save and activate the workflow.

## How to customize
- Change the update command if you’re running n8n via Docker:
  ```bash
  docker pull n8nio/n8n:latest
