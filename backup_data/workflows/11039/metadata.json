  "description": "# ETL Monitoring & Alert Automation: Jira & Slack Integration\n\nThis workflow automatically processes ETL errors, extracts important details, generates a preview, creates a log URL, classifies the issue using AI and saves the processed data into Google Sheets. If the issue is important or needs attention, it also creates a Jira ticket automatically.\n\nThe workflow reduces manual debugging effort, improves visibility and ensures high-severity issues are escalated instantly without human intervention.\n\n### Quick Start – Implementation Steps\n\n1. Connect your webhook or ETL platform to trigger the workflow.  \n2. Add your OpenAI, Google Sheets and Jira credentials.  \n3. Enable the workflow.  \n4. Send a sample error to verify Sheets logging and Jira ticket creation.  \n5. Deploy and let the workflow monitor ETL pipelines automatically.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow handles ETL errors end-to-end by:\n\n- Extracting key information from ETL error logs.\n- Creating a short preview for quick understanding.\n- Generating a URL to open the full context log.\n- Asking AI to identify root cause and severity.\n- Parsing the AI output into clean fields. \n- Saving the processed error to Google Sheets.\n- Creating a Jira ticket for medium/high-severity issues.\n\nThis creates a complete automated system for error tracking, analysis and escalation.\n\n## Who’s It For\n\n- DevOps & engineering teams monitoring data pipelines.\n- ETL developers who want automated error reporting. \n- QA teams verifying daily pipeline jobs.\n- Companies using Jira for issue tracking.  \n- Teams needing visibility into ETL failures without manual log inspection.\n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\n- n8n account or self-hosted instance.  \n- ETL platform capable of sending error payloads (via webhook).  \n- OpenAI API Key.  \n- Google Sheets credentials.\n- Jira Cloud API credentials.  \n- Optional: log storage URL (S3, Supabase, server logs).\n\n## How It Works & Setup Steps\n\n### 1. Get ETL Error (Webhook Trigger)\nReceives ETL error payload and starts the workflow.\n\n### 2. Prepare ETL Logs (Code Node)\nExtracts important fields and makes a clean version of the error.Generates a direct link to open the full ETL log.\n\n### 3. AI Severity Classification (OpenAI / AI Agent)\nAI analyzes the issue, identifies cause and assigns severity.\n\n### 4. Parse AI Output (Code Node)\nFormats AI results into clean fields: severity, cause, summary, recommended action.\n\n### 5. Prepare Data for Logging (Set / Edit Fields)\nCombines all extracted info into one final structured record.\n\n### 6. Save ETL Logs (Google Sheets Node)\nLogs each processed ETL error in a spreadsheet for tracking.\n\n### 7. Create Jira Ticket (Jira Node)\nAutomatically creates a Jira issue when severity is Medium, High or Critical.\n\n### 8. ETL Failure Alert (Slack Node)\nSends a Slack message to notify the team about the issue.\n\n### 9. ETL Failure Notify (Gmail Node)\nSends an email with full error details to the team.\n\n\n## How to Customize Nodes\n\n### ETL Log Extractor\nAdd/remove fields based on your ETL log structure.\n\n### AI Classification\nModify the OpenAI prompt for custom severity levels or deep-dive analysis.\n\n### Google Sheets Logging\nAdjust columns for environment, job name or log ID.\n\n### Jira Fields\nCustomize issue type, labels, priority and assignees.\n\n\n## Add-Ons (Extend the Workflow)\n\n- Send Slack or Teams alerts for high severity issues  \n- Store full logs in cloud storage (S3, Supabase, GCS)  \n- Add daily/weekly error summary reports  \n- Connect monitoring tools like Datadog or Grafana  \n- Trigger automated remediation workflows  \n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n1. Logging all ETL failures to Google Sheets  \n2. Auto-creating Jira tickets with AI-driven severity  \n3. Summarizing large logs with AI for quick analysis  \n4. Centralized monitoring of multiple ETL pipelines  \n5. Reducing manual debugging effort across teams  \n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|-------|----------------|----------|\n| Sheets not updating | Wrong Sheet ID or missing permission | Reconnect and reselect the sheet |\n| Jira ticket fails | Missing required fields or invalid project key | Update Jira mapping |\n| AI output empty | Invalid OpenAI key or exceeded usage | Check API key or usage limits |\n| Severity always “low” | Prompt too broad | Adjust AI prompt with stronger rules |\n| Log preview empty | Incorrect error field mapping | Verify the structure of the ETL error JSON |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nFor assistance setting up this workflow, customizing nodes or adding additional features, feel free to contact our [n8n developers](https://www.weblineindia.com/hire-n8n-developers/) at WeblineIndia.
