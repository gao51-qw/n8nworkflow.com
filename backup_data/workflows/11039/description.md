# ETL Monitoring & Alert Automation: Jira & Slack Integration

This workflow automatically processes ETL errors, extracts important details, generates a preview, creates a log URL, classifies the issue using AI and saves the processed data into Google Sheets. If the issue is important or needs attention, it also creates a Jira ticket automatically.

The workflow reduces manual debugging effort, improves visibility and ensures high-severity issues are escalated instantly without human intervention.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect your webhook or ETL platform to trigger the workflow.  
2. Add your OpenAI, Google Sheets and Jira credentials.  
3. Enable the workflow.  
4. Send a sample error to verify Sheets logging and Jira ticket creation.  
5. Deploy and let the workflow monitor ETL pipelines automatically.


## What It Does

This workflow handles ETL errors end-to-end by:

- Extracting key information from ETL error logs.
- Creating a short preview for quick understanding.
- Generating a URL to open the full context log.
- Asking AI to identify root cause and severity.
- Parsing the AI output into clean fields. 
- Saving the processed error to Google Sheets.
- Creating a Jira ticket for medium/high-severity issues.

This creates a complete automated system for error tracking, analysis and escalation.

## Who’s It For

- DevOps & engineering teams monitoring data pipelines.
- ETL developers who want automated error reporting. 
- QA teams verifying daily pipeline jobs.
- Companies using Jira for issue tracking.  
- Teams needing visibility into ETL failures without manual log inspection.

## Requirements to Use This Workflow

- n8n account or self-hosted instance.  
- ETL platform capable of sending error payloads (via webhook).  
- OpenAI API Key.  
- Google Sheets credentials.
- Jira Cloud API credentials.  
- Optional: log storage URL (S3, Supabase, server logs).

## How It Works & Setup Steps

### 1. Get ETL Error (Webhook Trigger)
Receives ETL error payload and starts the workflow.

### 2. Prepare ETL Logs (Code Node)
Extracts important fields and makes a clean version of the error.Generates a direct link to open the full ETL log.

### 3. AI Severity Classification (OpenAI / AI Agent)
AI analyzes the issue, identifies cause and assigns severity.

### 4. Parse AI Output (Code Node)
Formats AI results into clean fields: severity, cause, summary, recommended action.

### 5. Prepare Data for Logging (Set / Edit Fields)
Combines all extracted info into one final structured record.

### 6. Save ETL Logs (Google Sheets Node)
Logs each processed ETL error in a spreadsheet for tracking.

### 7. Create Jira Ticket (Jira Node)
Automatically creates a Jira issue when severity is Medium, High or Critical.

### 8. ETL Failure Alert (Slack Node)
Sends a Slack message to notify the team about the issue.

### 9. ETL Failure Notify (Gmail Node)
Sends an email with full error details to the team.


## How to Customize Nodes

### ETL Log Extractor
Add/remove fields based on your ETL log structure.

### AI Classification
Modify the OpenAI prompt for custom severity levels or deep-dive analysis.

### Google Sheets Logging
Adjust columns for environment, job name or log ID.

### Jira Fields
Customize issue type, labels, priority and assignees.


## Add-Ons (Extend the Workflow)

- Send Slack or Teams alerts for high severity issues  
- Store full logs in cloud storage (S3, Supabase, GCS)  
- Add daily/weekly error summary reports  
- Connect monitoring tools like Datadog or Grafana  
- Trigger automated remediation workflows  

## Use Case Examples

1. Logging all ETL failures to Google Sheets  
2. Auto-creating Jira tickets with AI-driven severity  
3. Summarizing large logs with AI for quick analysis  
4. Centralized monitoring of multiple ETL pipelines  
5. Reducing manual debugging effort across teams  

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Sheets not updating | Wrong Sheet ID or missing permission | Reconnect and reselect the sheet |
| Jira ticket fails | Missing required fields or invalid project key | Update Jira mapping |
| AI output empty | Invalid OpenAI key or exceeded usage | Check API key or usage limits |
| Severity always “low” | Prompt too broad | Adjust AI prompt with stronger rules |
| Log preview empty | Incorrect error field mapping | Verify the structure of the ETL error JSON |
