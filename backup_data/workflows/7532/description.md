## AI-Powered Personalized Cold Email Outreach System
**Categories:** Lead Generation, Business Automation, AI

This workflow automates personalized cold email outreach by fetching lead data from a **Google Sheet**, using an **AI Agent** (e.g., GPT-5) to analyze the prospect's business website, crafting a tailored message, and sending it via **Gmail**. It updates the sheet to track who has been contacted, creating a completely automated and intelligent outreach system.

### Benefits
* **Hyper-Personalized Outreach** - Generates unique email copy for each lead by analyzing their specific business website.
* **Automated & Efficient** - Runs automatically on a schedule, saving hours of manual lead research and email writing.
* **Seamless Integration** - Connects directly to **Google Sheets** and **Gmail** for a smooth, end-to-end process.
* **Flexible & Customizable** - The **AI Agent's** prompt can be easily adjusted to change the email tone, focus, and call-to-action.
* **Clear Tracking** - Updates the lead's status in your spreadsheet to prevent duplicate outreach and maintain a clean record.

### How It Works

1.  **Scheduled Trigger**: The workflow is activated at a pre-set time using the **Schedule Trigger** node.
2.  **Lead Ingestion**: It pulls leads from a designated **Google Sheet** where the `Outreach Status` is marked as `Pending`.
3.  **AI Analysis & Email Crafting**:
    * The **AI Agent** node reads the lead's website and other data.
    * It uses an advanced prompt to act as an email specialist, crafting a unique, value-driven email pitch tailored to the prospect.
4.  **Email Dispatch**: The workflow sends the personalized email to the prospect's address using the **Gmail** node.
5.  **Status Update**: It updates the `Outreach Status` in the **Google Sheet** from `Pending` to `Sent` for the processed lead.
