  "title": "AI chat agent: Dumpling AI + GPT-4o to auto-save local business data to Airtable",
  "description": "### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is for digital marketers, small business owners, lead generation agencies, and VAs who need a scalable way to find and store local business leads using AI. It’s especially useful for teams that want to enrich leads with real-time news insights and save the structured data to Airtable.\n\n---\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\nManually researching local businesses and staying up to date with relevant news is time-consuming and inefficient. This automation eliminates that burden by using Dumpling AI chat agents to generate leads and context, GPT-4o to summarize, and Airtable to store everything in one place.\n\n---\n\n### What this workflow does\nThis AI workflow listens for a manual trigger in n8n and executes the following steps:\n1. Extracts local business leads using a **Local Business Agent** from Dumpling AI.\n2. Pulls current news related to the business type or location using a **News Agent** from Dumpling AI.\n3. Uses GPT-4o to combine both responses into a human-readable summary.\n4. Extracts structured lead data like name, category, and city.\n5. Saves the summary and lead data into Airtable for easy follow-up.\n\n---\n\n### Setup\n\n#### 1. **Create AI Agents in Dumpling AI**\n- Sign in at [Dumpling AI](https://app.dumplingai.com)\n- Create two separate agents:\n  - **Local Business Agent**: Designed to respond with structured lists of businesses by location and category.\n  - **News Agent**: Designed to fetch relevant recent news and summaries about a specific industry or region.\n- After setting up each agent, copy the **Agent Key** from Dumpling AI. These keys will be required in the headers of your HTTP Request nodes in n8n.\n\n#### 2. **Manual Trigger**\n- This workflow begins with a manual trigger inside n8n, Which is the When chat message is recieved.\n- This makes it easy to test and reuse, especially during setup.\n\n#### 3. **Get Local Business Data from Dumpling AI**\n- The first HTTP Request node sends a prompt like `List 5 top real estate companies in Atlanta with full address and services`.\n- Include your **Local Business Agent Key** in the `x-agent-key` header.\n- The response will return a structured list of business leads.\n\n#### 4. **Get News Context from Dumpling AI**\n- The second HTTP Request node sends a prompt such as `Give me the latest news related to the real estate market in Atlanta`.\n- Use your **News Agent Key** in the header.\n- This fetches a brief set of recent news summaries relevant to the businesses being researched.\n\n#### 5. **Use GPT-4o to Merge and Summarize**\n- The GPT node combines the list of businesses and news into one coherent summary.\n- You can modify the prompt to output in paragraph format, bullet points, or structured notes.\n\n#### 6. **Save Lead to Airtable**\n- The Airtable node sends all structured fields into your selected base and table.\n- Be sure to connect your Airtable account and confirm the columns match exactly.\n\n---\n\n### How to customize this workflow\n- Replace the prompt inside the HTTP node to focus on different types of businesses or cities.\n- Expand the GPT output to include additional lead info like websites, phone numbers, or emails if the agent includes them.\n- Add a webhook trigger to allow this flow to be run via a chatbot, external app, or button.\n- Link to HubSpot or another CRM to sync the leads automatically.\n- Duplicate the process to run for multiple industries in parallel.\n\n---\n\n### Final Notes\n- You must create and configure your Dumpling AI agents first before running this workflow.\n- The Agent Keys from Dumpling AI are required in both HTTP Request nodes.\n- This flow is modular and flexible, ready for deeper CRM integrations.\n- The manual trigger is great for testing, but you can add a Webhook node to automate it.\n\nThis workflow helps you launch an intelligent lead gen process that combines location-targeted business discovery, AI-generated insights, and structured CRM-friendly output, all powered by Dumpling AI and OpenAI.\n",
