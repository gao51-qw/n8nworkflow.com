  "description": "### How It Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow is a comprehensive, AI-powered system that acts as a virtual content manager for creators and marketing teams. It automates the entire content lifecycle, from ingestion and analysis to multi-channel distribution and performance logging.\n\n1.  **Multi-Source Ingestion**: The workflow starts by ingesting new content from a trigger, such as a **WordPress** blog post or an **RSS Feed** from a YouTube channel.\n2.  **AI-Powered Analysis**: The new content is sent to an **OpenAI (GPT-4)** node, which performs a series of high-value tasks. It instantly creates a summary, extracts keywords, analyzes the sentiment, and generates tailored post drafts for different social media platforms.\n3.  **Smart Distribution**: A **Buffer** node then takes these AI-generated, platform-specific posts and schedules them for optimal times across your social media channels like **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, and **Facebook**.\n4.  **Centralized Archiving**: All of the content data, including the AI-generated summaries and insights, are automatically logged into a **Google Sheets** database. This creates a powerful, searchable archive and an analytics dashboard for tracking content performance.\n\n### How to Set Up 🛠️\n\n1.  **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n2.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    * **OpenAI**: Add your API Key.\n    * **WordPress**: Add your API credentials.\n    * **Buffer**: Add your API credentials.\n    * **Google Sheets**: Add your OAuth2 credentials.\n3.  **Customize Workflow Nodes**:\n    * **Node 1 (`WordPress Trigger`)**: Select your WordPress credential. You can also add other trigger nodes like `RSS Feed Read Trigger` if needed.\n    * **Node 2 (`OpenAI`)**: You can customize the prompt to get different kinds of output or translate into more languages.\n    * **Node 4 (`Buffer`)**: Select the social media profiles you want to post to.\n    * **Node 5 (`Google Sheets`)**: Replace the placeholder `[YOUR SPREADSHEET ID]` and `[YOUR CONTENT LOG SHEET NAME]` with your own details and map the data columns.\n4.  **Save & Activate**: Once all settings and credentials are configured, save the workflow and click the \"Inactive\" toggle in the top-right corner to make it live.",
