## How It Works
This workflow automates financial reconciliation by orchestrating multiple AI agents to detect mismatches, analyze root causes, and apply corrections across bank statements, invoices, and e-commerce platforms. Designed for finance teams, accountants, and business owners managing high transaction volumes, it eliminates manual reconciliation tedious work that typically consumes hours weekly. The system retrieves financial data from Stripe, banking APIs, and e-commerce platforms, then feeds it to specialized AI agents: one detects discrepancies using pattern recognition, another performs root cause analysis, and a third generates ledger corrections. An orchestrator agent coordinates these specialists, ensuring systematic processing. Results are logged to Google Sheets and trigger email notifications for critical issues, creating an audit trail while reducing reconciliation time from hours to minutes with 95%+ accuracy.
