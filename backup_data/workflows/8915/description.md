## Automate AI News Filtering with Keywords to Telegram

### This n8n template helps you stay up-to-date by automatically filtering news and sending relevant articles to Telegram using an AI Agent.

This workflow is perfect for **content marketers, journalists, or researchers** who need to find specific articles without manually sifting through countless news feeds.

### Steps to Take
* **Create BrowserAct Workflow:** Set up the **News Content Marketing Automation** template in your BrowserAct account.
* **Add BrowserAct Token:** Connect your BrowserAct account credentials to the **HTTP Request** inside **Run Node**.
* **Update Workflow ID:** Change the `workflow_id` value in the **HTTP Request** inside **Run Node** to match the one from your BrowserAct workflow.
* **Connect Gemini:** Add your Google Gemini credentials to the **AI Agent** node.
* **Configure Telegram:** Connect your Telegram account and add your Channel ID to the **Send a News Photo To Telegram** node.

### How it works
* The workflow is triggered automatically on a schedule, but you can also manually run it.
* It uses an **HTTP Request** node to start a web scraping task via the **BrowserAct** API to collect the latest news.
* A series of **If** and **Wait** nodes monitor the scraping job until the full data is ready.
* An **AI Agent** node, powered by **Google Gemini**, processes the headlines and filters the news based on a list of keywords you define.
* A **Code** node then formats the AI's output into a clean, readable format.
* Finally, the filtered news articles are sent as rich media messages to **Telegram**, including the headline, a picture, and a link.
