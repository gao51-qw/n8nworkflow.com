## Post Jobs to Multiple Boards from Google Sheets using BrowerAct

### This powerful n8n template turns a Google Sheet into a control panel for automating job postings across multiple job boards.

This workflow is perfect for HR teams, recruiters, and hiring managers who want to streamline their hiring process by posting jobs to multiple boards from a single source of truth.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

---
### How it works
* The workflow is triggered in two ways: **manually** (to batch-post all "Ready to Post" jobs) or **automatically** via a **Google Sheets Trigger** when a single row is updated.
* An **If** node filters for jobs marked with the status 'Ready to Post'.
* A **BrowserAct** node takes the job details (title, description, logins, target URL) and runs an automation to post the job on the specified board.
* An **If** node checks if the posting was successful. If it fails, a **Slack** alert is sent.
* A **Code** node parses the successful result from BrowserAct to get the status and live URL.
* The workflow **Updates the row in Google Sheets** with the `Live_URL` and changes the `Status` to 'Posted'.
* A final **Slack** message is sent to a channel to confirm the successful posting.

### Requirements
* **BrowserAct** API account for automated posting
* **BrowserAct** "**Automated Job Posting to Niche Job Site (Custom Site)**" Template | User needs to customize the workflow based on the target site.
* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))

* **Google Sheets** credentials
* **Slack** credentials for sending notifications
