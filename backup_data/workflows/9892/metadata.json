If it fails, a **Slack** alert is sent.\n* A **Code** node parses the successful result from BrowserAct to get the status and live URL.\n* The workflow **Updates the row in Google Sheets** with the `Live_URL` and changes the `Status` to 'Posted'.\n* A final **Slack** message is sent to a channel to confirm the successful posting.\n\n---\n### Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** API account for automated posting\n* **BrowserAct** \"**Automated Job Posting to Niche Job Site (Custom Site)**\" Template | User needs to customize the workflow based on the target site.\n* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))\n\n* **Google Sheets** credentials\n* **Slack** credentials for sending notifications\n\n---\n\n### Need Help?\n* #### [How to Find Your BrowseAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDjoZWEsZlE)\n* #### [How to Connect n8n to Browseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* #### [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n* #### [How to Use the BrowserAct N8N Community Node](https://youtu.be/j0Nlba2pRLU)\n",
