# Automate WordPress Elementor lead management with Excel CRM & email campaigns

> Description

This workflow automates lead collection from WordPress Elementor Forms, stores form submissions in an Excel/Google Sheet CRM, sends emails to both admin and the customer, and also performs recurring promotional email campaigns.

Ideal for anyone using:
Elementor Pro Form Widget
Elementor-based WordPress websites
Webhook-enabled contact forms
This system replaces multiple plugins and services (Mailchimp, CRM plugins) with a simple, fully automated workflow.

🌐 **What This Template Does**
🟦 1. Captures Elementor Form Submissions

The workflow starts with a Webhook Trigger connected to your Elementor form’s “Webhook” action.

It collects:
Name
Email
WhatsApp number
Budget
Project details
Any custom field from Elementor

🟩 2. Saves Each Lead to Excel / Google Sheets

Using the Sheets/Excel node, every form submission is stored as a new row in your CRM sheet.

This helps you maintain:
Lead database
Contact history
Budget details
Customer inquiry info

🟧 3. Sends Notification Email to the Website Owner

A Gmail node sends a fully formatted email to the site admin with all submission details.

Useful for:
Quick follow-up
Lead tracking
Team notifications

🟨 4. Sends Auto-Reply Email to Customer

A thank-you / confirmation email is automatically sent to the customer who submitted the Elementor form.

This creates:
Professional communication
Instant acknowledgment
Trust and credibility

🟫 5. Updates Excel Sheet with Email Status

After sending each email (admin & customer), an update is written back to the Excel sheet:

“Owner Mail Sent: YES”
“Customer Mail Sent: YES”
or error logs if needed.
This allows full auditability.

🟣 6. Scheduled Marketing Email Campaigns

A Schedule Trigger (daily/weekly/monthly) runs your promotional email batch.

It:

Reads email list from your Excel/Sheet
Loops through each row
Sends email using Gmail node
Logs “Campaign Email Sent” for each contact
This gives you a built-in email marketing engine using your CRM sheet as a source.

🟤 7. Loop + Gmail Email Sender

The workflow loops over each row and sends individual emails instead of bulk mailing.

Benefits:
Higher inbox delivery
Less spam detection
Personalized messaging
