  "description": "## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nManual checking of OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) answer sheets is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale—especially for schools, coaching institutes, and exam centers.  \nThis workflow automates **OMR evaluation end-to-end** using AI, from reading a scanned answer sheet image to calculating scores and storing structured results in Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?\n\n1. Accepts a **scanned OMR answer sheet image** via webhook.\n2. Uses **AI vision** to extract only the marked answers from the sheet.\n3. Extracts basic **student details** (Name, Roll Number, Class).\n4. Compares extracted answers with a predefined **answer key**.\n5. Calculates:\n   - Total questions\n   - Correct answers\n   - Incorrect answers\n   - Score percentage\n6. Generates **question-wise binary results** (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect).\n7. Stores the complete result in **Google Sheets**.\n8. Returns a structured **JSON response** to the calling system.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How It Works – Step by Step\n\n### 1. 📥 Webhook Trigger (Student OMR Upload)\n- A client uploads the OMR image via a `POST` request.\n- Image is received as `form-data` (`key: file`).\n\n### 2. 👁️ AI-Based OMR Image Analysis\n- An AI vision model analyzes the image.\n- Strict rules ensure:\n  - Only answer bubbles are considered\n  - Multiple markings → darkest option is selected\n  - Unmarked questions are skipped\n  - No guessing or hallucination\n- Output includes:\n  - Student details\n  - Question–answer pairs\n\n### 3. 🔄 Answer Formatting\n- Raw AI output is converted into a clean, structured format:\n  - `1:A, 2:B, 3:C, ...`\n- Student metadata is preserved separately.\n\n### 4. 🧮 Answer Key Setup\n- Correct answers are defined inside the workflow (editable anytime).\n- Supports any number of questions.\n\n### 5. 📊 Result Calculation\n- User answers are compared with the answer key.\n- Generates:\n  - Correct / Incorrect counts\n  - Percentage score\n  - Detailed per-question result\n  - Binary output (`Q.1 = 1 / 0`) for analytics\n\n### 6. 📄 Google Sheets Logging\n- Results are appended to a Google Sheet with columns such as:\n  - Student Name\n  - Roll No\n  - Class\n  - Correct\n  - Incorrect\n  - Score Percentage\n  - Q.1 → Q.n (binary values)\n\n### 7. 📤 API Response\n- Workflow responds with a JSON payload containing:\n  - Student details\n  - Full evaluation summary\n  - Per-question analysis\n\n---\n\n## 📂 Sample Google Sheet Output\n\n| Student Name | Roll No | Class | Correct | Incorrect | Score % | Q.1 | Q.2 | Q.3 | ... |\n|-------------|--------|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Rahul Shah | 1023 | 10-A | 16 | 4 | 80% | 1 | 0 | 1 | ... |\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Integrations Used\n\n- 🤖 **AI Vision Model** – for accurate OMR detection\n- ⚙️ **n8n Webhook** – to accept image uploads\n- 🧠 **Custom Code Nodes** – for parsing and evaluation logic\n- 📊 **Google Sheets** – for persistent result storage\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who can use this?\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n- 🏫 **Schools & Colleges**\n- 📚 **Coaching Institutes**\n- 🧪 **Online Exam Platforms**\n- 🧑‍💻 **EdTech Developers**\n- 📝 **Mock Test Providers**\n\nIf you need fast, reliable, and scalable OMR checking without expensive hardware—this workflow delivers.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Benefits\n\n- ⏱ Saves hours of manual checking\n- 🎯 Eliminates human error\n- 📊 Produces analytics-ready data\n- 🔄 Easy to update answer keys\n- 🌐 API-ready for integration with any system\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Ready to Deploy?\n\nJust configure:\n- ✅ AI model credentials\n- ✅ Google Sheets access\n- ✅ Your correct answer key\n\n…and start evaluating OMR sheets automatically at scale.\n",
