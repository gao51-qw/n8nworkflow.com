## Automated E-commerce Store Monitoring for New Products Using BrowserAct

### This n8n template is an advanced competitive intelligence tool that automatically monitors competitor E-commerce/Shopify stores and alerts you the moment they launch a new product.

This workflow is essential for e-commerce store owners, product strategists, and marketing teams who need real-time insight into what their competitors are selling.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

---
### How it works
* The workflow runs on a **Schedule Trigger** to check for new products automatically (e.g., daily).
* A **Google Sheets** node fetches your master list of competitor store links from a central sheet.
* The workflow **loops** through each competitor one by one.
* For each competitor, a **Google Sheets** node first creates a dedicated tracking sheet (if one doesn't exist) to store their product list history.
* A **BrowserAct** node then scrapes the competitor's current product list from their live website.
* The scraped data is saved to the competitor's dedicated tracking sheet.
* The workflow then fetches the *newly scraped list* and the *previously stored list* of products.
* A custom **Code** node (labeled "Compare Datas") performs a difference check to reliably detect if any new products have been added.
* If a new product is detected, an **If** node triggers an immediate **Slack** alert to your team, providing real-time competitive insight.
