  "description": "## AI-Powered LinkedIn Viral Content Generator & Telegram Bot\n\n**Disclaimer:**  \nThis workflow uses community-contributed nodes which are not officially maintained by n8n. Please test thoroughly before running in production. Do not use this template in production without your own independent validation.\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nThis workflow empowers you to generate highly viral LinkedIn posts, including both compelling copy and AI-generated custom images, directly from a Telegram chat interface. Leveraging AI-powered research, GPT-based content creation, and community-based integrations, it creates a seamless automation: from prompt to trend analysis, viral copywriting, image generation, and message delivery—all in one flow.\n\n---\n\n### Node-by-Node Workflow Explanation\n\n- **Telegram Trigger:** Starts the workflow from a specified Telegram chat by capturing user prompts.\n- **Expert Algo (AI Analysis):** Uses OpenAI and Tavily to research current LinkedIn trends, analyzes top-performing content, and produces a content framework plus an AI image prompt.\n- **Structured Output Parser:** Validates and formats the AI's returned JSON output.\n- **CM Junior:** Generates three LinkedIn post drafts in your own style, based on the viral framework and rules.\n- **Structured Output Parser1:** Ensures correct JSON for the drafted posts.\n- **Community Manager:** Evaluates the draft posts using additional trend analysis via Tavily, selects the one most likely to go viral.\n- **Structured Output Parser2:** Validates the community manager's single post output.\n- **Generate Image:** Calls the AI image generator on RapidAPI to create a picture for your post, using the recommended prompt.\n- **Split Out/Download Image:** Prepares and downloads the generated image file.\n- **Send Telegram Photo and Message:** Sends the chosen LinkedIn post and the generated image to your Telegram bot.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Telegram:** Create a bot using @BotFather and get your bot token and target chat ID.\n2. **OpenAI:** Register at OpenAI, obtain your API key.\n3. **Tavily:** Register at Tavily and get your API key.\n4. **RapidAPI (AI Image Generator):** Create an account, subscribe to the \"ai-text-to-image-generator-flux-free-api\", and copy your API key.\n5. **Credentials:** Use the n8n Credentials Manager to configure each key securely—**never** hardcode API keys into nodes.\n6. **Workflow Personalization:** Replace all placeholders like Telegram chat ID by referencing the credentials or environment variables.\n7. **Testing:** Run the workflow using your bot and ensure that no personal or sensitive data remains before publishing.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n\n- Update the image generator, Telegram, OpenAI, and Tavily node credentials through the n8n Credentials panel.\n- Custom tailor prompts and output formatting as needed for your LinkedIn content strategy.\n- For security, **do not** share any personal API keys or chat IDs in your public template.\n\n---\n![Capture d’écran 20250910 185857.png](fileId:2350)",
