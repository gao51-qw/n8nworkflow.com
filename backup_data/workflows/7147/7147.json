Works in healthcare administration with a stable 9-to-5 schedule and has two school-age children. Values reliability and practicality over flashy features.  Vehicle Needs: Seeks a dependable mid-size sedan or small SUV in the $22,000-32,000 range, preferably 1-3 years old. Prioritizes safety ratings, good gas mileage for the daily 20-mile commute, and enough space for car seats and groceries. Brand loyalty leans toward Honda, Toyota, or Mazda based on reputation for longevity.  Buying Process: Methodical researcher who spends 6-8 weeks comparing options online before visiting dealerships. Reads consumer reviews, checks reliability ratings, and calculates total cost of ownership. Prefers dealerships with transparent pricing and family-friendly service departments. Typically trades in every 6-7 years when repair costs start climbing or family needs change.  This persona represents the backbone of the used car market - practical buyers focused on transportation solutions rather than automotive enthusiasm."

Keyword data is enriched from ahref and everything is stored in a Google Sheet. This is great for market and customer research. Understanding search intent for a well defined audience and gives relevant actionable data in a fraction of time that manual research takes.\n\n### How it works\n* We'll define a customer profile in the 'Data' node\n* We use an OpenAI LLM to fetch relevant search intent as keywords and questions\n* We use an SEO MCP server to fetch keyword data from ahref free tooling\n* The fetched data is stored in the Google sheet\n\n### How to use\n* Make a copy of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10SEHuy5bYMrq_j1Tr2HBcM9I4O6ShYVV_k2tKEfxteI/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet and add it in all Google Sheet nodes\n* Make sure that n8n has read & write permissions for your Google sheet. For my self-hosted n8n instance I was using a [Google Service Account](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/service-account/)\n* Add your OpenAI account ([API Key](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/#using-api-key)) in the LLM nodes\n* Add your customer profile in the 'Data' node\n* Add MCP credentials for [seo-mcp](https://github.com/cnych/seo-mcp). Make sure you set the environments correctly:\n```json\n\"command\": \"uvx\",\n\"args\": [\"--python\", \"3.10\", \"seo-mcp\"],\n\"env\": {\n  \"CAPSOLVER_API_KEY\": \"CAP-xxxxxx\"\n}\n```\n* Execute workflow :)\n\n### Requirements\n* CapSolver account and API key ([register here](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/register?inviteCode=p-4Y_DjQymvt)) to use [seo-mcp](https://github.com/cnych/seo-mcp)\n* Google Drive account"
