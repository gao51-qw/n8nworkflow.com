  "description": "## 👤 Who’s it for\nThis workflow is for content creators, marketers, educators, or anyone who wants to **instantly summarize YouTube videos and repurpose them** into different formats (LinkedIn post, tweet, etc.) via a simple Telegram chatbot.\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\nThis n8n automation listens for messages in Telegram. If the message contains a YouTube link, it:\n- Extracts the video ID\n- Fetches the video transcript using RapidAPI\n- Cleans the transcript of any special characters\n- Sends it to OpenAI to generate a summary\n\nIf the message is **not a link**, it simply acts as an AI chatbot using OpenAI with memory support.\n\n✅ Supports follow-up prompts like:\n- “Make it shorter”\n- “Turn this into a LinkedIn post”\n- “Create a tweet thread”\n\n## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-User Support\n\nThis Telegram bot supports multiple users simultaneously. It tracks memory and context separately for each user using Telegram's unique `chat_id`.\n\n✅ Each user gets personalized AI replies  \n✅ Follow-up commands work per user  \n✅ No interference between users\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements\n- A Telegram bot token (get via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))\n- An OpenAI API Key (from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n- A RapidAPI Key and Host (typically `youtube-transcript3.p.rapidapi.com`)\n\n&gt; 🚨 API keys must be added manually — they are not included in the template.\n\n## 🧩 How to Set It Up\n1. Configure the **Telegram Trigger node** with your bot token.\n2. In the **HTTP Request node**, set:\n   - `X-RapidAPI-Key`: your RapidAPI key\n   - `X-RapidAPI-Host`: your RapidAPI host URL\n3. Add your **OpenAI API credentials** to the AI Agent node.\n\nUse the provided sticky notes for guidance inside the workflow itself.\n\n## 🎛️ How to Customize\n- Modify AI prompt behavior in the **AI Agent node**\n- Change the text formatting in the **Code node**\n- Use a different transcript API if preferred\n- Add commands like `make it into a blog post`, `summarize in bullet points`, etc.\n\n## 📌 Notes\n- All nodes are renamed to reflect their function\n- API credentials are removed for security\n- Includes colored boxes and sticky notes to guide the user\n- Compatible with n8n cloud and self-hosted setups\n\n",
