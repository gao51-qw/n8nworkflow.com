  "description": "### Who Is This For?  \nSmall businesses, consultants, agencies… anyone who bills with PayPal.\n\n### What Problem Does It Solve?  \nAutomates itemized invoicing and delivery via PayPal’s Invoicing API with support for an “Add more items?” loop.\n\n### What This Workflow Does  \n1. Collects your PayPal credentials & invoice data via a form  \n2. Dynamically generates a timestamp + random 4 digit number for the invoice_number  \n3. Calls PayPal to create and then send the invoice  \n4. Supports endless line-items via a Switch + Merge loop.\n\n### Setup  \n1. Grab a PayPal REST App’s Client ID & Secret.  \n2. Toggle “Live or Test” to point at production vs sandbox.  \n3. **PayPal Credentials**  \n   - If you select **Test**, this workflow points at PayPal’s **sandbox** (`api-m.sandbox.paypal.com`) and **requires your sandbox** Client ID & Secret.  \n   - If you select **Live**, it points at PayPal’s **production** endpoint (`api-m.paypal.com`) and **requires your live** Client ID & Secret.  \n4. (Optional) Customize your logo, currency, default notes.\n\n### How to Customize  \n– Change the currency dropdown  \n– Tweak the invoice-number format in the “Set Invoice Number and Date” code node  \n– Swap out or style the n8n Form nodes for your own UX\n",
