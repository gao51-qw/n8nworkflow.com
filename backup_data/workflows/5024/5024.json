    "description": "## 🚀 What the “Agent Builder” template does\n\nNeed to **turn a one-line chat request into a fully-wired n8n workflow template—complete with AI agents, RAG, and web-search super-powers—without lifting a finger?**\nThat’s exactly what *Agent Builder* automates:\n\n1. **Listens to any incoming chat message** (via the *Chat Trigger*).\n2. **Spins up an AI architect** that analyses the request, searches the web, reads n8n docs from a Pinecone vector store, and designs the smallest possible set of nodes.\n3. **Auto-generates a ready-to-import JSON template** and hands it back as a downloadable file—plus all the supporting assets (embeddings, vector store etc.) so the next prompt is even smarter.\n\nThink of it as your personal “workflow chef”: you shout the order, it shops for ingredients, cooks, plates, and serves the meal. All you do is eat.\n\n---\n\n## 🤗 Who will love this?\n\n* **No-code builders / power users** who don’t want to wrestle with AI node wiring.\n* **Agencies & consultants** delivering lots of bespoke automations.\n* **Internal platform teams** who need a “workflow self-service portal” for non-technical colleagues.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 How it’s wired\n\n| Sub-process                | What happens inside                                                                                                                                                                              | Key nodes                                                                              |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Web Crawler** (optional) | Firecrawl scrapes docs.n8n.io (or any URL you drop in) and streams raw markdown back.                                                                                                            | `Set URL → HTTP Request (Extract) → Wait & Retry`                                      |\n| **RAG Trainer**            | Splits the scraped docs, embeds them with OpenAI, and upserts vectors into Pinecone.                                                                                                             | `Recursive Text Splitter → Embeddings OpenAI → Train Pinecone`                         |\n| **Agent Builder**          | The star of the show – orchestrates GPT-4o (via OpenRouter), SerpAPI web-search, your Pinecone index and a Structured Output Parser to **produce → validate → prettify** the final n8n template. | `Chat Trigger → AI Agent → OpenAI (validator) → Code (extract) → Convert to JSON file` |\n\n*Every arrow in the drawn workflow is pre-connected, so the generated template always passes n8n’s import check.*\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Getting set up (5 quick creds)\n\n| Service                                             | Credential type                                            |\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **OpenAI / Azure OpenAI** – embeddings & validation | *OpenAI API*                                               |\n| **Pinecone** – vector store                         | *Pinecone API*                                             |\n| **OpenRouter** – GPT-4o LLM                         | *OpenRouter API Key*                                       |\n| **SerpAPI** – web search                            | *SerpAPI Key*                                              |\n| **Firecrawl** (only if you plan to crawl)           | Generic **Header Auth** → `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY` |\n\nEach node already expects those creds; just create them once, select in the dropdown, hit **Activate**.\n\n---\n\n## 🏃‍♀️ What a typical run looks like\n\n1. **User says:** “Build me a workflow that monitors our support inbox, summarises new tickets with GPT and posts to Slack.”\n2. *Chat Trigger* captures the message.\n3. **AI Agent**:\n\n   * queries Pinecone for relevant n8n docs,\n   * fires a SerpAPI search for “n8n gmail trigger example”,\n   * sketches an architecture (Gmail Trigger → GPT Model → Slack).\n4. The agent **returns JSON** ➜ OpenAI node double-checks field names, connections, type versions.\n5. A tiny JS Code node slices the JSON out of the chat blob and **saves it as `template.json`** ready for download.\n6. You download, import, and… done.\n\n---\n\n## ✏️ Customising\n\n* **Switch the LLM** – plug in Claude 3, Gemini 1.5, or a local model; just swap the *OpenRouter Chat Model* node.\n* **Point the RAG at your own docs** – change the crawl URL or feed PDFs via the *Default Data Loader*.\n* **Hard-code preferred nodes** – edit the “User node preferences” in the system message so the agent always chooses *Notion* for databases, etc.\n\n---\n\n## 🥡 Take-away notes\n\n* It's a **prototype** feel free to experiment with it to improve its capabilities.\n* **Have fun building!**\n",

Start by conceptualizing the architecture. It might be helpful to reflect in how a human team would tackle the task or go backwards (starting with the desired end state). Note that most workflows need an AI agent as its \"brain\". Consult your tools whenever beneficial. Once you thought of a meaningful structure actually populate the template with the nodes. Work very iterative and use the tools EXTENSIVELY! Fill the nodes with the correct content and CONNECT them properly! In a last check everything and make sure all nodes are properly connected! All but the trigger and final Output node must be connected to at least one input and one output node. Whenever you need information regarding what is possible in n8n, with what nodes and how they are set up and connected, consult the tools as you see it fit. \n\n# Tools\nYou have access to the following tools:\n1) Pinecone vector store containing some of n8n decumentation, saved in a Pinecone Vector database\n2) SerpAPI web search tool, with which you can search for example existing n8n workflows and templates or node characteristics (leverage this a lot!)\n\n# User node preferences (if not specified differently by the user use the following nodes for the listed functionalities):\nvector database: {{ $json['vector database'] }}\nchat model: {{ $json['chat model'] }}\nembeddings: {{ $json.embedding }}\nweb search tool: {{ $json['web search tool'] }}\n\n# Examples (variables are replaced with \"...\")\n--> output refers to the final result. still do not skip an elaborate step by step thinking process and extensive tool use!\n## example 1\n### input:

My goal is to help them build better brands with valuable, and practical content. \\nI have 4 main buckets of content on my page:\\n1) timeless principles. ideas for this videos are taken from timeless books: Influnece and Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini, $100M Leads and $100M Offers by Alex Hormozi, Ogilvy on Advertising.\\n2) case studies. for instance a case study breaking down on of the famous ads from the latest SuperBowl.\\n3) growth hacks. latest trends on how to grow with a proof. for instance an SEO tactic that became known in the last year.\\n4) contraversial ads. breakdowns of interesting and famous contraversial ads.\\nEvery video that I post is focused solely on one of the content buckets. That makes my content more diverse and covering more cool topics.\\n\\nEXPECTATION: Write me 1) name (short name for the post, less than 50 characters), 2) idea (detailed description in 3 sentences max), 3) title (the first sentence of the post, less than 80 characters, it should be ultra hooking), 4) full text of the post, 5) image description (the image is the first thing people will look at, so make it ultra hooking; write the image description to be super clear and ultra simple, so the AI image generator will precisely know that to generate; the image should be minimalistic) for a 200-300 words LinkedIn post from one of the content buckets described above.\\nMake sure to have great: hook, retention, and reward at the end.\\nThe post should clearly lead to a marketing/sales insight.\\nYour output should be in the JSON format.\\nIdea should always start with a category: Timeless principle, Case study, Growth hack, Contraversial ad.\\nExample output:\\n{\\\"name\\\": \\\"The Power of Social Proof\\\",\\n\\\"idea\\\": \\\"Timeless principle: Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that influences decision-making by showing how others' actions affect our own choices.

Liaqat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usmanliaqat404)\\n\\nThis guide will walk you through the 7 steps to fully configure your automation workflow using Google Sheets, Google Drive, Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity AI and LinkedIn.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 1: Set Up Google Sheets Credential\\n1. In the n8n Google Sheets node create a new credential using your Google account\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 2: Set Up Google Drive Credential\\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create or select a project\\n2. Enable the Google Drive API under APIs & Services > Library\\n3. Still in APIs & Services, select Credentials from the left menu\\n4. Click + CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID\\n5. For Application type, choose Web application\\n6. Under Authorized redirect URIs, paste the OAuth Redirect URL: https://oauth.n8n.cloud/oauth2/callback\\n7. Click Create, then copy the Client ID and Client Secret shown in the modal\\n8. In the n8n Google Drive node click Create Credential\\n9. Paste in the Client ID and Client Secret from Google Cloud\\n10. Click Sign in with Google, complete the OAuth consent flow, then Save your credential\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 3: Set Up Anthropic Credential\\n1. Navigate to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or sign up\\n2. Generate an API key\\n3. In the n8n \\\"Anthropic Chat Model\\\" node click Create Credential, past the API key and save\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 4: Configure OpenAI via HTTP Request Node\\n1. Visit the [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page and create a new secret key\\n2. In the n8n OpenAI Image node in the Authentication select Generic Credential Type\\n3. In Generic Auth Type select Header Auth\\n4. Create a new Header Auth, Name = Authorization, Value = Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 5: Configure Perplexity AI via HTTP Request Node\\n1. Go to the [Perplexity API Portal](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys) and click Create Key\\n2. Copy the generated API key\\n3. Inside n8n, in the sub-workflow, open the Perplexity Research node\\n4. In the Authentication select Generic Credential Type\\n5. In Generic Auth Type select Header Auth\\n6. Create a new Header Auth, Name = Authorization, Value = Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 6: Set Up LinkedIn Credential\\n1. In the n8n LinkedIn node create a new credential using your LinkedIn account\\n\\n---\\n\\n## ✅ Step 7: Customize The System For Your Use Case\\n1. In the Idea Generator node adjust the prompts to reflect your content style and your topics\\n2. Create a folder in your Google Drive where you will store all the images\\n3. Put in that folder the image with the style of your brand, that you want to replicate every time\\n4. Paste the shared link to this image in the \\\"Image Style\\\" node\\n5. In the OpenAI Image node adjust the prompt to reflect your image style\\n6. Copy my [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-F3ZioIs3oWOKMyDPMuquaH-qiuaZs6qdZXP-yNeRbs/edit?usp=sharing)\\n7. Select your Google Sheet in the Google Sheets nodes\\n8. Activate the system, now every day a new post will be created inside the Google Sheet, and once you've reviewed it (might edit it as well), set the status to \\\"ready\\\" and it will be posted; the posting mechanism is set to work every day, one post at a time\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow you're ready to run your workflow. Happy automating!\\n\"\n      },\n      \"typeVersion\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"e853ea9d-5b19-4b7b-8dc4-110bcc481471\",\n      \"name\": \"OpenAI Image\",\n      \"type\":

Use the **n8n version** dropdown to select your preferred release version:\n   - Latest Stable: recommended for most users.\n   - Latest Beta: get the newest n8n. This may be unstable.\n4. Select **Save Changes** to restart your n8n instance and perform the update.\n5. In the confirmation modal, select **Confirm**.\n\n## Best practices for updating [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/update-cloud-version/\\#best-practices-for-updating \"Permanent link\")\n\n- Update frequently: this avoids having to jump multiple versions at once, reducing the risk of a disruptive update. Try to update at least once a month.\n- Check the [Release notes](https://docs.n8n.io/release-notes/) for breaking changes.\n- Use [Environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/) to create a test version of your instance. Test the update there first.\n\n## Automatic update [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/update-cloud-version/\\#automatic-update \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n automatically updates outdated Cloud instances.\n\nIf you don't update you instance for 120 days, n8n emails you to warn you to update.

When the workflow pauses it offloads the execution data to the database. When the resume condition is met, the workflow reloads the data and the execution continues.\n\n## Operations [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Wait node can **Resume** on the following conditions:\n\n- [**After Time Interval**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#after-time-interval): The node waits for a certain amount of time.\n- [**At Specified Time**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#at-specified-time): The node waits until a specific time.\n- [**On Webhook Call**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#on-webhook-call): The node waits until it receives an HTTP call.\n- [**On Form Submitted**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#on-form-submitted): The node waits until it receives a form submission.\n\nRefer to the more detailed sections below for more detailed instructions.\n\n### After Time Interval [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#after-time-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\nWait for a certain amount of time.\n\nThis parameter includes two more fields:\n\n- **Wait Amount**: Enter the amount of time to wait.\n- **Wait Unit**: Select the unit of measure for the **Wait Amount**. Choose from:\n  - **Seconds**\n  - **Minutes**\n  - **Hours**\n  - **Days**\n\nRefer to [Time-based operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#time-based-operations) for more detail on how these intervals work and the timezone used.\n\n### At Specified Time [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#at-specified-time \"Permanent link\")\n\nWait until a specific date and time to continue. Use the date and time picker to set the **Date and Time**.\n\nRefer to [Time-based operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/#time-based-operations) for more detail on the timezone used.\n\n### On Webhook Call [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#on-webhook-call \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis parameter enables your workflows to resume when the Wait node receives an HTTP call.\n\nThe webhook URL that resumes the execution when called is generated at runtime. The Wait node provides the `$execution.resumeUrl` variable so that you can reference and send the yet-to-be-generated URL wherever needed, for example to a third-party service or in an email.\n\nWhen the workflow executes, the Wait node generates the resume URL and the webhook(s) in your workflow using the `$execution.resumeUrl`. This generated URL is unique to each execution, so your workflow can contain multiple Wait nodes and as the webhook URL is called it will resume each Wait node sequentially.\n\nFor this **Resume** style, set more parameters listed below.\n\n#### Authentication [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect if and how incoming resume-webhook-requests to `$execution.resumeUrl` should be authenticated. Options include:\n\n- **Basic Auth**: Use basic authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Basic Auth** to use.\n- **Header Auth**: Use header authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for Header Auth** to use.\n- **JWT Auth**: Use JWT authentication. Select or enter a new **Credential for JWT Auth** to use.\n- **None**: Don't use authentication.\n\nAuth reference\n\nRefer to the [Webhook node \\| Authentication documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#supported-authentication-methods) for more information on each auth type.\n\n#### HTTP Method [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#http-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect the HTTP method the webhook should use. Refer to the [Webhook node \\| HTTP Method documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/#http-method) for more information.\n\n#### Response Code [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#response-code \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter the Response Code the webhook should return. You can use common codes or enter a custom code.\n\n#### Respond [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#respond \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet when and how to respond to the webhook from these options:\n\n- **Immediately**: Respond as soon as the node executes.\n- **When Last Node Finishes**: Return the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow. If you select this option, also set:\n  - **Response Data**: Select what data should be returned and what format to use. Options include:\n    - **All Entries**: Returns all the entries of the last node in an array.\n    - **First Entry JSON**: Return the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.\n    - **First Entry Binary**: Return the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.\n    - **No Response Body**: Return with no body.\n- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node.\n\n#### Limit Wait Time [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#limit-wait-time \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off). If turned on, also set:\n\n- **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:\n  - **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.\n    - Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.\n    - Select the limit's **Unit** of time.\n  - **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n    - **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Webhook Call options [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#on-webhook-call-options \"Permanent link\")\n\n- **Binary Property**: Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to. This option's only relevant if binary data is received.\n- **Ignore Bots**: Set whether to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers (turned on) or not (turned off).\n- **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enter IP addresses here to limit who (or what) can invoke the webhook URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IPs outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook URL.\n- **No Response Body**: Set whether n8n should send a body in the response (turned off) or prevent n8n from sending a body in the response (turned on).\n- **Raw Body**: Set whether to return the body in a raw format like JSON or XML (turned on) or not (turned off).\n- **Response Data**: Enter any custom data you want to send in the response.\n- **Response Headers**: Send more headers in the webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs \\| Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.\n- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.\n\n#### On Webhook Call limitations [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#on-webhook-call-limitations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are some limitations to keep in mind when using On Webhook Call:\n\n- Partial executions of your workflow changes the `$resumeWebhookUrl`, so be sure that the node sending this URL to your desired third-party runs in the same execution as the Wait node.\n\n### On Form Submitted [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#on-form-submitted \"Permanent link\")\n\nWait for a form submission before continuing. Set up these parameters:\n\n#### Form Title [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#form-title \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter the title to display at the top of the form.\n\n#### Form Description [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#form-description \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a form description to display beneath the title. This description can help prompt the user on how to complete the form.\n\n#### Form Fields [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#form-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet up each field you want to appear on your form using these parameters:\n\n- **Field Label**: Enter the field label you want to appear in the form.\n- **Field Type**: Select the type of field to display in the form. Choose from:\n  - **Date**\n  - **Dropdown List**: Enter each dropdown options in the **Field Options**.\n    - **Multiple Choice**: Select whether the user can select a single dropdown option (turned off) or multiple dropdown options (turned on)\n  - **Number**\n  - **Password**\n  - **Text**\n  - **Textarea**\n- **Required Field**: Set whether the user must complete this field in order to submit the form (turned on) or if the user can submit the form without completing it (turned off).\n\n#### Respond When [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#respond-when \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet when to respond to the form submission. Choose from:\n\n- **Form Is Submitted**: Respond as soon as this node receives the form submission.\n- **Workflow Finishes**: Respond when the last node of this workflow finishes.\n- **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: Respond when the [Respond to Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook/) node executes.\n\n#### Limit Wait Time [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#limit-wait-time_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet whether the workflow will automatically resume execution after a specific limit type (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\nIf turned on, also set:\n\\\\* **Limit Type**: Select what type of limit to enforce from these options:\n\\\\* **After Time Interval**: Wait for a certain amount of time.\n\\\\* Enter the limit's **Amount** of time.\n\\\\* Select the limit's **Unit** of time.\n\\\\* **At Specified Time**: Wait until a specific date and time to resume.\n\\\\* **Max Date and Time**: Use the date and time picker to set the specified time the node should resume.\n\n#### On Form Response options [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#on-form-response-options \"Permanent link\")\n\n- **Form Response**: Choose how and what you want the form to **Respond With** from these options:\n  - **Form Submitted Text**: The form displays whatever text is entered in **Text to Show** after a user fills out the form. Use this option if you want to display a confirmation message.\n  - **Redirect URL**: The form will redirect the user to the **URL to Redirect to** after they fill out the form. This must be a valid URL.\n- **Webhook Suffix**: Enter a suffix to append to the resume URL. This is useful for creating unique webhook URLs for each Wait node when a workflow contains multiple Wait nodes. Note that the generated `$resumeWebhookUrl` won't automatically include this suffix, you must manually append it to the webhook URL before exposing it.\n\n## Templates and examples [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Scrape business emails from Google Maps without the use of any third party APIs**\n\nby Akram Kadri\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2567-scrape-business-emails-from-google-maps-without-the-use-of-any-third-party-apis/)\n\n**Fully Automated AI Video Generation & Multi-Platform Publishing**\n\nby Juan Carlos Cavero Gracia\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/3442-fully-automated-ai-video-generation-and-multi-platform-publishing/)\n\n**Respond to WhatsApp Messages with AI Like a Pro!**\n\nby Jimleuk\n\n[View template details](https://n8n.io/workflows/2466-respond-to-whatsapp-messages-with-ai-like-a-pro/)\n\n[Browse Wait integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/wait/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n## Time-based operations [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/\\#time-based-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor the time-based resume operations, note that:\n\n- For wait times less than 65 seconds, the workflow doesn't offload execution data to the database. Instead, the process continues to run and the execution resumes after the specified interval passes.\n- The n8n server time is always used regardless of the timezone setting. Workflow timezone settings, and any changes made to them, don't affect the Wait node interval or specified time.\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!

Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.\n\nSome things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.\n\n## Understanding the scenario [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-3/\\#understanding-the-scenario \"Permanent link\")\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?\n\n**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.\n\nI have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.\n\nThis manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get it done on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?\n\n**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!

You can find the trigger node docs [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).\n\n## Use query parameters [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/\\#use-query-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.\n\nFor example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ```<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>``` | ```<br>[<br>    {<br>        \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",<br>        \"name\": \"Alex\",<br>        \"age\": 21 <br>    },<br>    {<br>        \"email\": \"jamie@example.com\",<br>        \"name\": \"Jamie\",<br>        \"age\": 33 <br>    }<br>]<br>``` |\n\nYou can write a query like:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ```<br>1<br>``` | ```<br>SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;<br>``` |\n\nThen in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ```<br>1<br>2<br>``` | ```<br>// users is an example table name<br>{{ [ 'users', $json.email ] }} <br>``` |\n\n## Common issues [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/\\#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/common-issues/).\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback!

You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.\n\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:\n\n- [Environments in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.\n- [Git and n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.\n\n## Choose your source control pattern [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#choose-your-source-control-pattern \"Permanent link\")\n\nBefore setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.\n\nRecommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance\n\nYou can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.\n\n### Multiple instances, multiple branches [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#multiple-instances-multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\n[![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)\n\nThe advantages of this pattern are:\n\n- An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.\n- It supports more than two instances.\n\nThe disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.\n\n### Multiple instances, one branch [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#multiple-instances-one-branch \"Permanent link\")\n\n[![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)\n\nThe advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n- If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.\n- Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.\n\n## Set up your repository [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#set-up-your-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.\n\n[Multi-branch](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/#__tabbed_1_1)[Single-branch](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/#__tabbed_1_2)\n\n1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).\n   - Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n   - Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.\n2. Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.\n\n[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).\n\n- Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n- Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.\n\n## Connect your n8n instances to your repository [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#connect-your-n8n-instances-to-your-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreate two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.\n\n### Configure Git in n8n [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#configure-git-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\n1. Go to **Settings** \\> **Environments**.\n2. In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.\n3. n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.\n4. Copy the SSH key.\n\n### Set up a deploy key [\\#](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/\\#set-up-a-deploy-key \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access.
