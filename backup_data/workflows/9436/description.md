Transform accounts payable from a manual bottleneck into an intelligent, automated system that reads invoices, detects fraud, and processes payments automatically—saving 20+ hours per week while preventing costly fraudulent payments.

3. **🚨 Fraud Detection Engine** - Analyzes 15+ fraud patterns: duplicates, anomalies, suspicious vendors, document quality
4. **🚦 Intelligent Routing** - Auto-routes based on AI risk assessment:
   - **Critical Fraud (Risk 80-100)**: Block → Slack alert → CFO investigation
   - **Manager Review (&gt;$5K or Medium Risk)**: Approval workflow with full analysis
   - **Auto-Approve (&lt;$5K + Low Risk)**: Instant → QuickBooks → Vendor notification
5. **📊 Complete Audit Trail** - Every decision logged to Google Sheets with AI reasoning
