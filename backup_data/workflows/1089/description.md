**Notion Trigger:** The Notion Trigger node will trigger the workflow when new data gets added to Notion.

**IF node:** This node will check if the notes belong to the team `Marketing`. If the team is `Marketing` the node will `true`, otherwise `false`.

**Mattermost node:** This node will send a message about the new data in the channel 'Marketing' in Mattermost. If you have a different channel, use that instead. You can even replace the Mattermost node with nodes of other messaging platforms, like Slack, Telegram, Discord, etc.

**NoOp node:** Adding this node here is optional, as the absence of this node won't make a difference to the functioning of the workflow.
