  "description": "# RAG over a PDF with Weaviate\nThis workflow allows you to upload a PDF file and ask questions about it using the Question and Answer Chain and the Weaviate Vector Store nodes.\n\n## Who it's for\nThis workflow is the simplest possible implementation of RAG with Weaviate in n8n. It's intended to act as an extendable template for RAG over your own documents.\n\n## Prerequisites\n1.  **An existing Weaviate cluster.** You can view instructions for setting up a **local cluster** with Docker [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose#starter-docker-compose-file) or a **Weaviate Cloud** cluster [here](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/quickstart).\n2.  **API keys** to generate embeddings and power chat models. We use [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), but feel free to switch out the models as you like.\n3.  **Self-hosted n8n instance.** See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq5bmrjPPAY&t=108s) for how to get set up in just three minutes.\n\n## How it works\n### Part 1: Manually upload data\nIn this example, we manually upload a 100+ page article from arXiv called [\"A Survey of Large Language Models\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.18223). But you can replace this with your own more advanced data pipeline, if you wish.\n### Part 2: Embed and load data into Weaviate collection\nHere, we generate embeddings for the full-text of the article and store them in Weaviate.\n### Part 3: Perform RAG over PDF file with Weaviate\nIn this part of the workflow, you can enter your query by running the Chat Node and get a RAG response grounded in context via the Question and Answer Chain node.\n\n\n## How to run the workflow\n1. Go through the prerequisites, creating a Weaviate cluster (can be local or cloud), downloading self-hosted n8n, and adding your API keys and other credentials.\n2. Select the embedding and chat models you'd like to use.\n3. Upload a PDF file you want to ask questions about.\n4. Execute the rest of the workflow.\n",
