## Who is this for?
This n8n workflow is designed for Facebook Page administrators, social media managers, and community moderators who want to automate comment management on their Facebook Pages. It's perfect for businesses with high comment volume, content creators, and marketing teams who need to maintain a positive community environment without manually reviewing every comment. The workflow automatically filters and responds to positive/supportive comments while handling negative ones appropriately.
