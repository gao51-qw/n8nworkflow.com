  "description": "### **Workflow Overview**  \nThis workflow automates the creation and management of a **custom OpenAI Assistant** for a travel agency (\"Travel with us\"), leveraging Google Drive for document storage.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n\n#### **1. Create the OpenAI Assistant**  \n- **Node**: `OpenAI`  \n  - **Action**: Creates a custom assistant named *\"Travel with us\" Assistant* using the `gpt-4o-mini` model.  \n  - **Instructions**:  \n    - Respond **only** using the provided document (e.g., agency-specific info).  \n    - Stay friendly, brief, and focused on travel-related queries.  \n    - Ignore irrelevant questions politely.  \n  - **Credentials**: Requires OpenAI API key.  \n\n#### **2. Upload Agency Document**  \n- **Google Drive Node**:  \n  - **Action**: Downloads a Google Doc as a PDF.   \n- **OpenAI2 Node**:  \n  - **Action**: Uploads the PDF to OpenAI with `purpose: \"assistants\"`.  \n  - **Output**: Generates a `file_id`.  \n\n#### **3. Update the Assistant with the Document**  \n- **OpenAI Node**:  \n  - **Action**: Updates the assistant to include the uploaded file.\n\n#### **4. Chat Interaction**  \n- **Chat Trigger**:  \n  - Activates when a message is received (*\"When chat message received\"*).  \n- **OpenAI Assistant Node**:  \n  - **Action**: Uses the updated assistant to respond to user queries.  \n  - **Memory**: `Window Buffer Memory` retains chat context for coherent conversations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Prepare the Document**:  \n   - Store your travel agency guide in Google Drive (e.g., as a Google Doc).  \n   - Update the **Google Drive node** with your document’s ID.  \n\n2. **Configure Credentials**:  \n   - **Google Drive**: Connect via OAuth2 (`googleDriveOAuth2Api`).  \n   - **OpenAI**: Add your API key to all OpenAI nodes.  \n\n3. **Customize the Assistant**:  \n   - Modify the `instructions` in the `OpenAI` node to reflect your agency’s needs.  \n   - Ensure the document includes FAQs, policies, and travel info.  \n\n4. **Test the Workflow**:  \n   - Trigger manually (*\"Test workflow\"*) to create the assistant and upload the file.  \n   - Send a chat message (e.g., *\"What are your travel packages?\"*) to test responses.  \n\n---\n\n### **Dependencies**  \n- **Google Drive Account**: To store and retrieve the agency document.  \n- **OpenAI API Access**: For assistant creation and file uploads.  \n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).\n",
