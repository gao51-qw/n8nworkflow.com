## This n8n template demonstrates how to add a tie form data to a new PDF. The idea is to automate the creation of a professional looking job posting.

Use cases would be organizations who need to automate the creation of job postings. 

### How it Works

* The trigger is a form that asks for job position, salary, office location, and responsiblities
* When the form is posted, it kicks off the workflow's next steps
* A Word document is downloaded from a Dropbox folder. This Word document is used as the template for the posting.
* The Word document is converted to base64.
* A call to Foxit's Document Generation endpoint includes the encoded Word document along with the form information.
* The resulting PDF is downloaded and converted from base64 into binary.
* At this point, the PDF is just there, but it could be emailed, sent to another workflow, etc.

### Requirements

* A Dropbox account. The workflow's first step points to a Word template. See our [doc gen](https://docs.developer-api.foxit.com/#document-generation-apis) APIs for information on how to craft the Word doc, but the easiest way is to copy text like so:

```
Job Position
We are pleased to announce the opening of a new job, {{ jobPosition }}. This job pays ${{ salary }} per year and is in our {{ office }} location. The details of this job are:

{{ responsibilities }}
```

* Foxit developer account (https://developer-api.foxit.com)

### Next Steps

As mentioned above, you could do anything with the resulting PDF when done.
