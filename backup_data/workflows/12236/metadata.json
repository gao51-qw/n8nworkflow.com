  "description": "## Description\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to build an AI-powered Market Research Assistant using a multi-agent workflow.\nIt helps you get a 360-degree view of a product idea or research topic by analysing:\n* Customer insights and pain points\n* Market size and macro/micro-economic trends\n* Competitive landscape and alternatives\nThe workflow mirrors how product managers and strategy teams conduct discovery — by breaking down research into parallel workstreams and then synthesizing insights into a single narrative.\n\n\n## How it works\n1. Planner Agent The main agent receives your research topic as input and defines:\n    * Research objective\n    * Key areas of focus (Customer, Market, Competition)\n    * Assumptions and constraints\n2. Parallel Research Agents Based on the planner’s output, three specialist agents run in parallel:\n    * Customer Insights Agent Researches public sources such as articles and forums to infer customer behaviour, pain points, and existing tools.\n    * Market Scan Agent Analyses macro-economic and micro-economic trends, estimates TAM/SAM/SOM, and highlights key risks and assumptions.\n    * Competitor Insights Agent Identifies existing competitors and substitutes and summarises how they are positioned in the market.\n3. Synthesis Agent The outputs from all research agents are consolidated and analysed by a synthesis agent, which produces a market discovery memo.\n4. Final Output The discovery memo is generated as a document and sent to your email.\n\n\n## How to use\n* Trigger the workflow via the chat message node.\n* Provide your research topic or product idea, along with optional context such as target market.\n* The workflow runs automatically and delivers a structured discovery memo to your inbox.\n\n\n## Setup Steps\n* API credentials for:\n    * Groq or OpenAI (LLM)\n    * Documentero (document generation)\n* A configured Documentero template\n* Gmail OAuth or email credentials for delivery of memo\n",
