# Header 1Smart Weekly Job Discovery Powered by Decodo

This workflow automates the entire search process: every week, it uses **Decodo’s reliable scraping engine** to scan the web for fresh opportunities in your region and industry — no manual searching, no endless scrolling.

Decodo handles the heavy lifting behind the scenes:
it gathers search results, opens each job link, and extracts clean, readable text from pages that are normally full of scripts and formatting noise. The workflow always receives structured, usable information ready for AI analysis.

## Intelligent Matching — Not Just Scraping
Once the jobs are collected, the system analyzes the candidate’s CV and compares it to each posting.
It evaluates:
- Skill alignment
- Experience relevance
- Domain match
- Seniority level

Then it generates a Match Percentage for each role, filtering out weak options and keeping only meaningful opportunities.

## A Weekly Report That Feels Human
Every week, the workflow sends a polished report straight to your inbox:
- A quick overview of the candidate’s strengths
- Best-fit roles sorted by match score
- Clear reasons why each job fits
- Posted dates and direct links
- Insights on skills and market trends

It reads like a personalized career briefing — generated automatically.
