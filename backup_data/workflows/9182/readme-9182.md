## 🛠 Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Import Workflow**: Copy the JSON → n8n → Workflows → + Add → Import from JSON

2. **Configure [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=zillow_workflow) API**:
   - Sign up at [Scrape.do Dashboard](https://dashboard.scrape.do/sign-up)
   - Get your API token
   - In HTTP Request node, replace `YOUR_SCRAPE_DO_TOKEN` with your actual token
   - The workflow uses `super=true` for premium residential proxies (10 credits per request)

3. **Configure Google Sheets**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Add two tabs: "Sheet1" (input) and "Results" (output)
   - In Sheet1, add header "URLs" in cell A1
   - Add Zillow URLs starting from A2
   - Set up Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n
   - Replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID` with your actual Google Sheet ID
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIAL_ID` with your credential ID

4. **Run & Test**:
   - Add 1-2 test Zillow URLs in Sheet1
   - Click "Execute workflow"
   - Check results in Results tab

## 🧰 How to Customize

- **Add more fields**: Extend parsing logic in "Parse Zillow Data" node to capture additional data (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- **Filtering**: Add conditions to skip certain properties or price ranges
- **Rate Limiting**: Insert a Wait node between requests if processing many URLs
- **Error Handling**: Add error branches to handle failed scrapes gracefully
- **Scheduling**: Replace Manual Trigger with Schedule Trigger for automated daily/weekly runs

## 📊 Use Cases

- **Investment Analysis**: Track property prices and zestimates over time
- **Market Research**: Analyze listing trends in specific neighborhoods
- **Portfolio Management**: Monitor properties for sale in target areas
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare similar properties across locations
- **Lead Generation**: Build databases of properties matching specific criteria

## 📈 Performance & Limits

- **Single Property**: ~5-10 seconds per URL
- **Batch of 10**: 1-2 minutes typical
- **Large Sets (50+)**: 5-10 minutes depending on [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=zillow_workflow) credits
- **API Calls**: 1 [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=zillow_workflow) request per URL (10 credits with `super=true`)
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate with premium proxies

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| API error 400 | Check your [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/?utm_source=n8n&utm_medium=zillow_workflow) token and credits |
| URL showing "undefined" | Verify Google Sheet column name is "URLs" (capital U) |
| No data parsed | Check if Zillow changed their HTML structure |
| Permission denied | Re-authenticate Google Sheets OAuth2 in n8n |
| 50000 character error | Verify Parse Zillow Data code is extracting fields, not returning raw HTML |
| Price shows HTML/CSS | Update price extraction regex in Parse Zillow Data node |
