  "description": "**Description:**\n\nThis advanced n8n automation template checks the validity and production-readiness of multiple JSON workflow files using AI-powered analysis. \n\nIt scans a designated Google Drive folder for uploaded JSON files, downloads them one by one, parses their structure, and sends each JSON to GPT-4 via LangChain Agent for intelligent validation. Results are automatically logged into a Google Sheet with structured feedback.\n\nIdeal for QA analysts, workflow engineers, or product teams maintaining large libraries of automation blueprints—this template removes manual review from your JSON pipeline.\n\n**What This Template Does (Step-by-Step)**\n\n🟢 Manual Trigger: Starts the flow when user clicks \"Execute Workflow\".\n\n📁 Google Drive File Search: Connects to a specified folder (e.g., Edtech) and fetches a list of all JSON files.\n\n🔁 Batch Processor (SplitInBatches): Loops through each file one-by-one to prevent overload or parallel conflicts.\n\n📥 File Downloader: Downloads each file using its unique File ID from Google Drive.\n\n📤 JSON Extractor: Converts each downloaded file from binary to structured JSON.\n\n🤖 LangChain AI Agent + Azure GPT-4\n\n🟢 Sends each JSON structure to a GPT-4-powered 🟢 LangChain Agent.\n🟢 AI validates and analyzes:\n- JSON structure integrity\n- Presence of required nodes/connections\n- Proper use of credentials\n- Industry-readiness\n🟢 Observations on modularity, error handling, or fragility\n\n📊 Google Sheets Logger: Writes AI-generated insights back into a Google Sheet (e.g., tab: final) for team visibility and tracking.\n\n**Required Integrations**\n\n- Google Drive API (OAuth2)\n- Google Sheets API (OAuth2)\n- Azure OpenAI or OpenAI GPT-4 API Key\n- LangChain AI Agent & Memory Modules\n\n**Perfect For**\n\n🧪 QA teams validating hundreds of n8n workflows\n⚙️ Workflow engineers ensuring automation design standards\n📊 Ops teams tracking AI-generated feedback at scale\n💼 SaaS platforms that auto-upload workflows for approval\n🧠 Internal AI audit tools for low-code/no-code ecosystems\n\n**Why Use This Template?**\n\n✅ Fully automated JSON parsing and review\n✅ AI-powered structural audit with actionable feedback\n✅ Zero manual checking—great for scale\n✅ Write-back to Google Sheets for traceability\n✅ Modular, loop-safe, and scalable for enterprise ops\n",
