This template processes webhooks received from amoCRM in a URL-encoded format and transforms the data into a structured array that n8n can easily interpret. 
By default, n8n does not automatically parse URL-encoded webhook payloads into usable JSON. This template bridges that gap, enabling seamless data manipulation and integration with subsequent processing nodes.

**Key Features:**
- Input Handling: Processes URL-encoded data received from amoCRM webhooks.
- Data Transformation: Converts complex, nested keys into a structured JSON array.
- Ease of Use: Simplifies access to specific fields for further workflow automation.

**Setup Guide:**
- Webhook Trigger Node: Configure the Webhook Trigger node to receive data from amoCRM.
- URL-Encoding Parsing: Use the provided nodes to transform the input URL-encoded data into a structured array.
- Access Transformed Data: Use the resulting JSON structure for subsequent nodes in your workflow, such as filtering, updating records, or triggering external systems.

**Example Data Transformation:**
- Sample Input (URL-Encoded):
The following input format is typically received from amoCRM:
$json.body['leads[update][0][custom_fields][0][id]']  

- Output (Structured JSON):
After processing, the data is transformed into an easily accessible JSON array format:
{{ $json.leads.update[‘0’].id }}  

This output allows you to work with clean, structured JSON, simplifying field extraction and workflow continuation.

**Code Explanation:**
This workflow parses URL-encoded key-value pairs using n8n nodes to restructure the data into a nested JSON object. By doing so, the template improves transparency, ensures data integrity, and makes further automation tasks straightforward.
