This n8n workflow reads emails from your Outlook inbox, drafts AI-powered replies using OpenAI, and routes them through the **gotoHuman** node for human approval before replying automatically.

---

## ✅ Key Features

- **Reads Outlook emails** from today only (excluding those from your own address).
- **AI-generated replies** crafted using OpenAI based on the subject and body of the email.
- **Community node integration**: Uses the `gotoHuman` node for human review and approval of replies before sending.
- **Safe sending**: Only approved responses are automatically sent back via Outlook.
- **Expandable**: Can be easily modified to:
  - Send drafts instead of full replies
  - Include additional email filters
  - Trigger at intervals or via webhook

## 🪜 Workflow Steps Overview

### 1. **Trigger**  
Use the Manual Trigger to test or schedule execution with a cron node.

### 2. **Filter Emails from Today**
A Code node outputs today's date in the proper `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

```javascript
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
return [{ json: { searchQuery: `received:${today.toISOString().split('T')[0]}` } }];
```

### 3. **Search and Filter Outlook Messages**
- Uses the Outlook node with a search query like:  
  `received:2025-08-06 -from:rbreen@ynteractive.com` (Update to your email)

### 4. **Generate AI Response**
- Text prompt to OpenAI:  
  ```
  subject: {{ $json.subject }}  
  body: {{ $json.body.content }}
  ```

- System prompt:  
  &gt; You are a personal assistant helping respond to emails. I am an AI automation expert specializing in helping small and medium-size businesses automate processes. Create a short response to the email. Sign the email as Robert Breen.

### 5. **Review with gotoHuman**
- Submit AI output for human approval using the `gotoHuman` node.
- The output schema should match the Review Template fields (e.g., "email", "OriginalEmail").

### 6. **IF Node Decision**
- If status is `approved`, send reply
- If not, return to loop for revision or skip
