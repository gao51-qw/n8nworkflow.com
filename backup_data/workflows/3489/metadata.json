  "description": "![image.png](fileId:1106)\n\n🧠 A plug-and-play n8n workflow that adds LLM-powered reasoning, planning, and action to your automations — with prompts, schemas, and full agent logic included.\n\n**Ever wish your n8n flows could think before they act?**\n\n**Now they can.** Say hello to the ultimate agent-based upgrade:\n\n**\"Think → Plan → Act\"** – fully automated. Fully intelligent.⚡\n\n🧩 **What Is This?**\nThis product is a ready-to-use AI-powered workflow template for n8n, featuring a smart “Thinking Agent” that:\n\n🧠 Analyzes tasks\n📋 Generates a step-by-step plan\n🛠️ Executes actions intelligently\n🧾 Returns structured JSON outputs for your next steps\n\nInspired by the Hugging Face agent architecture, this template gives your automations a brain before they press the red button. 🔴✅\n\n**A clean 2-step process:**\nTHINK mode → Generates structured reasoning (goal, subgoals, tools, assumptions)\nACT mode → Executes subgoals step-by-step using tools and AI.\n\n🧬 **What's Inside?**\nThis isn’t just a flow — it’s a framework. You get:\n🔹 Modular Agent Loop\n🔹 A demonstration workflow\n\n📝 **Requirements**\n🔹 OpenRouter API Key (or any other provider like OpenAI, groq...)\n\n🔹 **Built-in Parsers**\n🧾 Structured JSON parser for reliable outputs\n🪄 Natural language and unstructured parsing fallback\n\n🛠️ Plug in your own goals, tools, and OpenRouter keys\n\n📦 **Includes a demo (e.g., “get the weather”) to get started fast**\n\n💡 **Why You'll Love It**\n✅ Plug & Play – Drop into any existing n8n flow\n✅ Tool-Aware Reasoning – Plans include which tool to use and why\n✅ Composable – Build workflows like agents: Reason → Plan → Execute\n✅ Customizable by anyone – Even your intern can tweak the prompts\n\n⚙️ **Agent customization**\n🔹 Feel free to customize the agent settings by changing the `Config` node. Here's the default configuration:\n\n```ts\nconst config = {\n  THINK: {\n    CONTEXT: ``, // Add the necessary context to the AI.\n    CONSTRAINTS: [`Rule 1`, `Rule 2`], // here are the rules that your AI should follow\n    TOOLS: [\n      {\n        tool: \"\",\n        description: \"\",\n      },\n    ], // add here the list of the tools that the AI will call in your backend or workflow.\n  },\n};\n\nreturn {\n  json: {\n    config: config,\n    input: $input.last().json,\n  },\n};\n```\nAfter updating the configuration file, you will see the AI reasoning for your input. Feel free to connect with any other node creating smart tasks!",
