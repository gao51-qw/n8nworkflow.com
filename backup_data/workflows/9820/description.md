Automated workflow to remove video backgrounds and composite foreground video on static image backgrounds. Perfect for creating branded content, professional presentations, and consistent visual branding across your videos.

## How it works

• **Upload inputs**: Provide foreground video URL and background image URL (both must be publicly accessible)
• **Remove background**: API automatically removes video background with AI-powered segmentation
• **Composite on image**: Video is centered on custom image background with aspect ratio preserved
• **Save to Drive**: Final composed video is automatically uploaded to Google Drive with shareable link
