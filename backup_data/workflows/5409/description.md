## SETUP

**Setup Input :** The first part of the workflow can be replaced with anything else. You need as input a Prompt and the Base Image URL (publicly available).

**Setup Output :** In this Workflow, the output is storing the image on Airtable but you can replace that with anything else but basically you have two options : 
- Store the Generated Image somewhere : Keep everything like this and replace the last Airtable node with the Third Party you want to use.
- Use the Image directly in n8n : In HTTP Request "Generate Image" switch sync_mode to "true", remove all the following nodes and add "Extract form File" node (convert to Base64 String)


**APIs :** For the following third-party integrations, replace ==[YOUR_API_TOKEN]== with your API Token or connect your account via Client ID / Secret to your n8n instance:
- Fal AI (FLUX KONTEXT MAX) : https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext/max/api#schema-input
- Airtable : https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=node_settings_modal-credential_link&utm_campaign=n8n-nodes-base.airtable
