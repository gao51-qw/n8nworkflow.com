## 🧠 Overview

This multi-agent n8n automation simulates a high-functioning marketing team. A strategic CMO agent receives your chat-based input, decides which specialist is best for the task, and delegates accordingly. Each specialist (copywriter, SEO expert, brand strategist, etc.) operates independently using fast, cost-effective GPT-4.1-mini models—resulting in parallel task execution and full-funnel marketing output with minimal human input.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. A **chat message trigger** listens for input (e.g. “Write a full email funnel for our SaaS launch”).
2. The **CMO Agent** (powered by OpenAI O3) reads the message and determines intent, strategy, and needed outputs.
3. It dynamically delegates tasks to the correct AI agent:
   - Copywriter Agent  
   - Facebook Ads Specialist  
   - SEO Content Writer  
   - Email Marketer  
   - Social Media Manager  
   - Brand Voice Specialist
4. Each agent uses a dedicated **GPT-4.1-mini** model to produce results instantly.
5. Final content is returned to the user or passed along for integration with your CMS, ad platforms, or CRM.
