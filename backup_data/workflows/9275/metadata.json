  "description": "# Stripe → Pipedrive (Automatic Person + Deal Creation)\n\n## Prerequisites / Requirements\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted) with HTTPS reachable webhook endpoint\n- Stripe account and secret API key\n- Pipedrive account with API access and custom fields defined\n- Users should create custom fields in Pipedrive and copy their field IDs (e.g. amount, payment method, status, Stripe Event ID)\n\n## How it works (Step-by-Step)\n**Stripe Webhook:** n8n triggers on payment events from Stripe via an HTTP POST.\n\n**Edit / Set node:** Extracts eventId, eventType, and payload.\n\n**HTTP Request:** Confirms Stripe event via Stripe API (adds security).\n\n**Search Person:** Looks up Pipedrive contact by email from the Stripe payload.\n\n**IF:** Checks whether the person exists.\n    - If exists → skip to deal creation.\n        - If node - Check if Event id is not the same\n            - If same - Skip the deal creation\n            - If different - Create a deal linked to that person with the payment amount\n    - If not → create new Person.\n\n**Create Person:** Adds new Pipedrive contact, populates custom fields (amount, payment method, status, source).\n\n**Create Deal:** Creates a deal linked to that person with the payment amount.\n\n## Description \n**This workflow connects Stripe to Pipedrive. Whenever a new payment (or checkout success) occurs in Stripe, this automation will:\n- Fetch the full Stripe event data\n- Find or create a customer (“Person”) in Pipedrive\n- Create a “Deal” record corresponding to that payment\n- Log custom fields like amount, source, payment method, status\n\n### It’s ideal for \n- SaaS \n- Subscription businesses\n- Agencies, or \n- Teams who want payments mirrored inside their CRM without manual work.\n\n## Modification Notes / Extensions\n\nYou can extend this workflow by:\n- Adding Slack or Gmail notifications after deal creation.\n- Logging every event in Google Sheets or Notion for audit.\n- Enriching the customer using OpenAI / CRM data.\n- Handling refunds, subscription cancellations, etc.\n",
