    "description": "# WooCommerce Daily Sales & Revenue Spike Monitor → Slack Alert\n\nThis workflow automatically checks your WooCommerce store’s last 24 hours of revenue, top-selling products, and cancelled orders on a daily schedule. It sends Slack notifications when sales cross a defined threshold or provides a detailed status update—including cancellation impact—if the target hasn’t been met, helping teams react quickly without manual reporting.\n\n### 🚀 Quick Implementation Steps\n\n* Set up the Schedule Trigger to run daily\n* Connect WooCommerce and fetch recent orders\n* Filter paid and cancelled orders separately\n* Filter both datasets to the last 24 hours\n* Calculate revenue, top products, and cancellation impact\n* Merge and format sales and cancellation data\n* Compare revenue with a configurable threshold\n* Send enriched Slack alerts with sales and cancellation insights\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow serves as a **daily sales and revenue health monitoring assistant** for your WooCommerce store.\n\n* It runs automatically on a schedule and collects recent order data from WooCommerce via API.\n* Only paid orders (Completed / Processing) are considered for revenue calculations.\n* Cancelled orders are processed in a separate branch to track revenue loss.\n* Orders created within the last 24 hours are filtered for both paid and cancelled orders.\n* The workflow calculates **total revenue**, **order count**, **average order value**, and **top-selling products**.\n* It also calculates **cancelled order count** and **cancelled revenue** to highlight potential revenue leakage.\n* Sales and cancellation data are merged into a single structured object.\n* An **IF node** checks whether revenue exceeds a predefined threshold.\n* If the threshold is crossed, a **Slack Sales Spike Alert** is sent with cancellation context.\n* If the threshold is not reached, a **Slack Status / Pending Alert** is sent showing progress, top products, and cancellation impact—keeping the team informed without noise.\n\n## Who’s It For\n\n* Business owners monitoring daily sales and revenue health\n* Sales and marketing teams tracking revenue spikes and losses\n* E-commerce managers using WooCommerce\n* Operations teams monitoring cancellations and fulfillment risks\n* Non-technical users who want actionable insights without dashboards\n\n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\n* An active **WooCommerce store**\n* **WooCommerce REST API credentials**\n* An **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)\n* A **Slack workspace** with incoming webhook or Slack credentials\n* Permission to read WooCommerce orders and post Slack messages\n\n\n## How It Works & Set Up\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger**\n\n   * Configure the Schedule Trigger to run once per day at your preferred time.\n\n2. **Fetch Orders from WooCommerce**\n\n   * Use the WooCommerce node to retrieve recent orders from your store.\n\n3. **Filter Paid Orders**\n\n   * Keep only orders with status `Completed` or `Processing`.\n\n4. **Filter Last 24 Hours Orders**\n\n   * A Code node filters paid orders created within the last 24 hours.\n\n5. **Calculate Top Products**\n\n   * A Code node aggregates product quantities sold in the last 24 hours.\n\n6. **Calculate Total Revenue**\n\n   * A Code node calculates total revenue, order count, and average order value.\n\n7. **Fetch & Process Cancelled Orders**\n\n   * A separate WooCommerce branch fetches orders with status `Cancelled`.\n   * Cancelled orders are filtered to the last 24 hours using a Code node.\n   * A Code node calculates cancelled order count and cancelled revenue.\n\n8. **Merge & Format Sales Data**\n\n   * A Merge node combines sales metrics and cancellation metrics.\n   * A Code node formats all results into a single JSON object for Slack.\n\n9. **Threshold Check**\n\n   * An IF node compares total revenue against a fixed threshold.\n\n10. **Send Slack Alerts**\n\n* **TRUE path**: Sends a **Sales Spike Alert** including revenue, top products, and cancellation impact.\n* **FALSE path**: Sends a **Status / Pending Alert** showing current performance, top products, and cancellation insights.\n\n11. **Activate Workflow**\n\n* Test once and activate the workflow for daily monitoring.\n\n\n## How To Customize Nodes\n\n* **Threshold Value**: Update the IF node condition to match your business target\n* **Schedule Time**: Change the Schedule Trigger execution time\n* **Slack Channels**: Update Slack nodes to post in your desired channels\n* **Order Status Logic**: Adjust filters for paid or cancelled orders if needed\n* **Time Window**: Modify the 24-hour logic to 12 hours, 48 hours, or weekly\n* **Cancellation Sensitivity**: Add conditions to alert on high cancellation volume or revenue impact\n\n\n## Add-ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\n* Add **cancellation rate (%)** and **net revenue** calculations\n* Trigger alerts when **cancellation revenue exceeds a defined percentage**\n* Store daily sales and cancellation history in **Google Sheets or a database**\n* Add **day-over-day or week-over-week comparisons**\n* Send alerts to **Microsoft Teams or Email**\n* Attach a **CSV report** with order and cancellation details\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n* Detect viral product sales quickly\n* Monitor flash sale performance\n* Identify revenue loss due to cancellations\n* Alert leadership on high-revenue or high-risk days\n* Track campaign-driven sales spikes and drop-offs\n* Support inventory, operations, and customer experience planning\n\n&gt; Many more business scenarios can be addressed based on your store’s needs.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue                              | Possible Cause                   | Solution                                 |\n| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| No Slack alert received            | Revenue did not exceed threshold | Check threshold or test with lower value |\n| Workflow fails                     | WooCommerce API error            | Verify API credentials and permissions   |\n| Revenue or cancellation shows zero | Orders filtered out              | Validate order status and date logic     |\n| Slack message not sent             | Wrong Slack credentials          | Reconnect Slack node                     |\n| Orders missing                     | Timezone mismatch                | Align WooCommerce and n8n timezone       |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nNeed help setting up this workflow or
