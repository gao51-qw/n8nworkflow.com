This Workflow simulates an AI-powered phone agent with [RetellAI](https://dashboard.retellai.com/?ref=davide) with two main functions:

1. **📅 Appointment Booking** – It can schedule appointments directly into Google Calendar.  
2. **🧠 RAG-based Information Retrieval** – It provides answers using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. For example, it can respond to questions such as store opening hours, return policies, or product details.

The guide also explains **how to purchase a dedicated phone number** (with a +1 prefix) and link it to the AI agent. This setup is cost-effective, as it uses a **FREE $10 credit** to operate without additional charges in the beginning.

### **How It Works**  
This Workflow simulates an AI-powered phone agent with two primary functions:  

1. **Appointment Booking**  
   - The workflow captures call events (e.g., `call_ended` or `call_analyzed`) and extracts key details (transcript, caller info, duration, etc.).  
   - Using OpenAI, it summarizes the conversation and parses structured data (e.g., names, contact info, dates).  
   - For scheduling, it converts user-provided dates into Google Calendar-compatible formats and creates events automatically.  

2. **RAG-Based Information Retrieval**  
   - When a query is received (e.g., store hours, product details), the workflow retrieves relevant information from a Qdrant vector store.  
   - An AI agent processes the query using the retrieved data and responds via a webhook, ensuring accurate, context-aware answers.   

---  

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Prepare Qdrant Vector Store**  
   - Create/refresh a Qdrant collection (via HTTP requests).  
   - Upload and vectorize documents (e.g., from Google Drive) using OpenAI embeddings.  

2. **Configure RetellAI Agent**  
   - Sign up for [RetellAI](https://dashboard.retellai.com/?ref=davide), create an agent, and set the webhook URLs (`n8n_call` for call events, `n8n_rag_function` for RAG queries).  
   - Purchase a Twilio phone number and link it to the agent.  

3. **n8n Workflow Setup**  
   - Connect OpenAI, Qdrant, Google Calendar, and Telegram nodes with credentials.  
   - Customize prompts for summarization, date parsing, and RAG responses.  
   - Test the workflow to ensure data flows from call events → processing → actions (e.g., calendar bookings, Telegram alerts).  

4. **Deploy**  
   - Trigger the workflow via RetellAI webhooks during calls.  
   - Monitor outputs (e.g., call summaries in Telegram, calendar events).  

**Note**: Replace placeholders (e.g., `QDRANTURL`, `COLLECTION`, `CHAT_ID`) with actual values.
