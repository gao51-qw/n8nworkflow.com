This n8n workflow automatically creates and sends regular performance summaries to parents using data from a Learning Management System (LMS). It pulls student grades and attendance, formats them into easy-to-read reports, and emails them without any manual work.

## Good to Know
- **Fully Automated**: Generates reports and sends emails using LMS data.
- **Regular Updates**: Sends summaries on a set schedule (e.g., every Monday at 9 AM).
- **Clear Reports**: Includes student grades, attendance, and progress notes.
- **Error Alerts**: Notifies admins via email if something goes wrong.
- **Scalable**: Works for multiple students across different classes.

## How It Works
### Report Generation Flow
1. **Weekly Trigger**: Starts the process every Monday at 9 AM.
2. **Fetch LMS Data**: Pulls grades, attendance, and progress from the LMS.
3. **Process Data**: Organizes the data into a clear report format.
4. **Generate HTML Report**: Creates a readable report with student details.
5. **Send Email to Parents**: Emails the report to parents’ addresses.
6. **Log Report Delivery**: Records the sent reports in a log.

## Example Sheet Columns
- **Student ID**: Unique identifier for each student.
- **Name**: Full name of the student.
- **Grade**: Current academic grade or score.
- **Attendance**: Percentage of classes attended.
- **Progress Notes**: Brief comments on performance.
- **Report Date**: Date the report was generated.

## How to Use
1. **Import Workflow**: Add the workflow to n8n using the “Import Workflow” option.
2. **Set Up LMS Access**: Configure n8n with LMS credentials to fetch data.
3. **Configure Email**: Add parent email addresses and set up an email service (e.g., Gmail).
4. **Activate Workflow**: Save and turn on the workflow in n8n.
5. **Check Logs**: Verify reports are sent and logs are updated.

## Requirements
- **n8n Instance**: Self-hosted or cloud-based n8n setup.
- **LMS Access**: API or credentials to connect to the LMS.
- **Email Service**: SMTP setup (e.g., Gmail) for sending reports.
- **Admin Oversight**: Someone to monitor and fix any errors.

## Customizing This Workflow
- **Change Schedule**: Adjust the trigger to send reports weekly or monthly.
- **Add More Data**: Include extra LMS fields like behavior notes.
- **Custom Email**: Change the email template for a personalized touch.
