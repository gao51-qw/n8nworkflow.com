This workflow automatically analyzes sales territory performance, comparing revenue, win rates, and activity across regions. Remove the guesswork from territory planning and drive balanced growth.

## Overview

On a weekly schedule, the workflow pulls CRM data for each territory, merges it with demographic and market size info scraped via Bright Data, and feeds everything into OpenAI for performance benchmarking. Outliers—both high and low performers—are highlighted in a Google Data Studio dashboard and summarized in a Slack message.
