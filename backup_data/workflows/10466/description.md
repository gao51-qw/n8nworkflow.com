*   Providing a no-code setup that is fully automated and scalable.

## What this workflow does

This workflow demonstrates how to generate AI images using Nano Banana and n8n, with an integrated Telegram chatbot interface.  
The process includes:

1.  Connecting Gemini Nano Banana to n8n.
2.  Automating image generation requests triggered from Telegram.
3.  Returning AI-generated images back to the user.
4.  Allowing customization of prompts and styles dynamically.

By the end, you’ll have a fully functional automation to generate and send AI-created images through Telegram — no coding required.

## Setup

1.  **Create accounts:**

*   Sign up on [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) and ensure you have Telegram Bot API access.
*   Connect your Nano Banana or Gemini API endpoint.

3.  **Set up your Telegram Bot:**

*   Insert your API key and prompt parameters.

7.  **Handle responses:**

*   Parse the AI-generated image output.
*   Send the image file back to the Telegram user.

9.  **Test and Deploy:**

*   Run a sample image prompt.
*   Verify that Telegram returns the correct generated image.

## How to customize this workflow to your needs

*   Modify prompts or styles to fit different artistic use cases.
*   Add conditional logic for image size, aspect ratio, or filters.
*   Integrate with Google Drive or Notion for image storage.
*   Schedule automatic image generation for campaigns or content creation.
