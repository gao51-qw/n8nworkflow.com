## How It Works
This workflow automates monthly revenue aggregation from multiple financial sources, including Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, and bank feeds, while delivering intelligent tax forecasting through GPT-4–based structured analysis. It systematically retrieves revenue data, consolidates disparate datasets into a unified view, and applies GPT-4 to predict upcoming tax obligations with greater accuracy. The system then generates clearly formatted, audit-ready reports and automatically distributes tax projections to designated agents via Gmail, while securely storing all outputs in Google Sheets to maintain traceable audit trails. Designed for tax professionals, accounting firms, and finance teams, it enables accurate predictive tax planning and supports a proactive compliance strategy without the need for manual calculations or spreadsheet-driven analysis.
