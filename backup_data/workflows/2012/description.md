This template can be used to scan a domain/company with [Icypeas](https://www.icypeas.com/). Be sure to have an active account to use this template. 



**How it works**
This workflow can be divided into three steps :
1. The workflow initiates with a manual trigger (On clicking 'execute').
2. It connects to your Icypeas account.
3. It performs an HTTP request to scan a domain/company name.

**Set up steps**
1. You will need a working icypeas account to run the workflow and get your API Key, API Secret and User ID.
2. You will need a domain/company name to perform the search.
