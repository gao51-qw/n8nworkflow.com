# 📅 Auto-Log Calendly Bookings to Google Sheets

This workflow automatically captures new **Calendly bookings** and saves them into a structured **Google Sheet**. It records all important details like invitee name, email, phone, event type, date, time, status, meeting link, and notes. No more manual copy-pasting from Calendly into your CRM or sheets.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Calendly Booking Webhook**  
   - Listens for new bookings (`invitee.created` event).  
   - Triggers every time someone schedules a meeting.  

2. **Normalize Booking Data**  
   - A **Code node** parses Calendly’s payload.  
   - Extracts invitee name, email, phone number, event type, time, notes, and meeting link.  
   - Ensures consistent data format for Sheets.  

3. **Save Booking to Google Sheets**  
   - The **Google Sheets node** appends a new row with the booking details.  
   - Prevents duplicate entries using append/update mode.  

4. **Log Booking Success**  
   - A **Code node** logs the successful save.  
   - Can be extended to send confirmation emails, Slack alerts, or calendar invites.
