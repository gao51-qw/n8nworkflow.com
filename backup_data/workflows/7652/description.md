Estimate **material price** and **total cost** for grouped BIM/CAD elements using an **LLM-driven** analysis. The workflow accepts an existing **XLSX** (from your model) or, if missing, can trigger a local **RvtExporter.exe** to generate one. It enriches each element group with quantities, pricing, confidence, and produces a **multi-sheet Excel** report plus a polished **HTML executive report**.

## What it does
- **Reads grouped element data** (from XLSX or extracted via `RvtExporter.exe`).
- Builds **enhanced prompts** with clear rules (volumes/areas are already aggregated per group).
- Calls your selected **LLM** (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.) to identify materials, pick the pricing unit, and estimate **price per unit** and **total cost**.
- **Parses AI output**, adds per-group KPIs (cost %, rank), and aggregates **project totals** (by material, by category).
- Exports a **multi-sheet XLSX** and an **HTML executive report** (charts, KPIs, top groups).

## Prerequisites
- **LLM credentials** for your chosen provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). Enable exactly one chat node and connect credentials.
- **Windows host** only if you want to auto-extract from `.rvt/.ifc` via `RvtExporter.exe`. If you already have an XLSX, Windows is **not required**.
- Optional: Internet access on the LLM side for price lookups (model/tooling dependent).

## How to use
1. **Import** this JSON into n8n.
2. Open the **Setup** node(s) and set:
   - `project_file` — path to your `.rvt/.ifc` or to an existing grouped `*_rvt.xlsx`
   - `path_to_converter` — `C:\\DDC_Converter_Revit\\datadrivenlibs\\RvtExporter.exe` (optional)
   - `country` — used to guide price sources/standards (e.g., `Germany`)
3. In the canvas, **enable one LLM node** (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic) and connect credentials; keep others disabled.
4. **Execute workflow** (Manual Trigger). It will detect/build the XLSX, run analysis, then write the **Excel** and open the **HTML** report.

## Outputs
- **Excel**: `Price_Estimation_Report_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx` with sheets:
  - `Summary`, `Detailed Elements`, `Material Summary`, `Top 10 Groups`
- **HTML**: executive report with charts (project totals, top materials, top groups).
- Per-group fields include: *Material (EU/DE/US), Quantity & Unit, Price per Unit (EUR), Total Cost (EUR), Assumptions, Confidence*.

## Notes & tips
- Quantities in the input are **already aggregated per group** — do **not** multiply by element count.
- If you prefer XLSX-only extraction, run your converter with a `-no-collada` flag upstream.
- Keep ASCII-safe paths and ensure write permissions to the output folder.
