# 🍅 Custom pomodoro tracker using Telegram and Google Sheet

> *Tags: Productivity, Pomodoro, Organization*

### Context  
Hey! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) , a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com) 🌱

A significant improvement in my productivity came from following the **Pomodoro Technique**.

### What is the Pomodoro Technique?  
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks your workday into 25-minute focus intervals followed by short breaks. After 4 cycles, you take a longer break to recharge.  
It helps maintain concentration while preventing burnout.

I’ve used this technique with web apps to receive break/work notifications. But I always wished I had a way to **track my sessions** for self-assessment.

&gt; Let’s use **n8n** to boost our productivity and log our deep work sessions automatically!

### Who Is This Template For?  
I built this workflow for creators, freelancers, students, and professionals who love the Pomodoro technique but want more than just timers — they want data.

This template helps you:
- Track every deep work session automatically
- Store logs in Google Sheets for later analysis
- Stay in control via Telegram commands  

There is no need to pay for premium apps. It’s all **free** and powered by **n8n**.

### How Does It Work?  
This Telegram bot tracks your Pomodoro sessions and sends you alerts during the process.

**Here’s what happens:**

1. A user sends `/start` to the bot.
2. It launches a 25-minute deep work timer.
3. After 25 minutes, the bot sends a break reminder.
4. **After four cycles**, a long break is triggered and the session is logged.
5. The session is **automatically recorded to Google Sheets** with (Date & Time, User ID, Pomodoro count, Session ID, Duration of focus and breaks)
