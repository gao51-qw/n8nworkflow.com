## 📌 Short Overview

Automatically sync files from Google Drive into a searchable AI knowledge base with Pinecone, and answer user queries using GPT-4o with conversational memory.

⸻

## 🛠️ Workflow Usage Steps

### 1.	Watch Google Drive for file changes
Trigger the workflow when a new file is uploaded or an existing file is updated in a specific Google Drive folder.
### 2.	Download and process the file
Retrieve the file, split it into smaller text chunks with a Recursive Character Text Splitter, and generate vector embeddings using OpenAI.
### 3.	Store embeddings in Pinecone
Save the embeddings in a Pinecone vector database to keep your knowledge base continuously updated and searchable.
### 4.	Search context for chat queries
When a user asks a question, query Pinecone for relevant context, combine results with conversational memory, and process them with GPT-4o.
### 	5.	Respond with AI-powered answers
Provide a concise response (100–200 words) that blends knowledge from your documents with the conversation history.

## ✅ Use Cases
•	Keep a live, AI-ready knowledge base from your Google Drive files.
	•	Enable team members to query company documents instantly.
	•	Build a personal assistant that stays up to date with your latest uploads.


## ⚙️ Setup Steps
1.	Google Drive
	•	Create a Google Cloud project.
	•	Enable the Google Drive API.
	•	Generate OAuth credentials and connect them in n8n.
2.	OpenAI
	•	Sign up at OpenAI.
	•	Copy your API key from the dashboard.
	•	Add it to n8n under Credentials → OpenAI API.
3.	Pinecone
	•	Create an account at Pinecone.
	•	Create a new index (e.g., docs-embeddings).
	•	Copy your API key and environment, then add them to n8n under Credentials → Pinecone API.
4.	Workflow Configuration
	•	Import this workflow into your n8n instance.
	•	Select the Google Drive folder you want to monitor.
	•	Set the Pinecone index name in the workflow.
	•	Adjust chunk size / overlap in the text splitter if needed.
5.	Test the Workflow
	•	Upload a new document to your Google Drive folder.
	•	Run the workflow to confirm embeddings are created and stored in Pinecone.
	•	Ask a sample query and verify the AI returns a context-aware answer.
