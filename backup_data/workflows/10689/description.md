# Automated SEO Watchlist: Continuous Audits Powered by Decodo, Gemini and Google Sheets

## Who’s it for

This workflow is designed for SEO specialists, marketing teams, agencies, and website owners who want an effortless, automated way to monitor SEO health. It’s perfect for ongoing audits, content monitoring, and proactive SEO management — without the manual workload.

## How it works / What it does

Every five days, the workflow:

1. Reads a list of URLs from Google Sheets.
2. Uses Decodo to fetch live on-page data — titles, meta descriptions, headings, schema, links, and Core Web Vitals.
3. Passes that data to Gemini AI for an advanced SEO analysis and scoring based on key factors (content, metadata, links, speed, and structure).
4. Parses results via a Structured Output Parser for clean JSON output.
5. Stores findings in Google Sheets and sends a Telegram alert when the audit completes.
