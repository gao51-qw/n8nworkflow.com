## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To use this workflow, you will need active credentials for the following services:

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Getting this powerful detector running is a simple 3-step process.

### Step 1: Connect Your Credentials

This is the most important step. You only need to configure two types of credentials.

*   #### **(A) QuickBooks Online Account**
    1.  Find the first QuickBooks node, named **`Fetch_30Day_Invoices`**.
    2.  In the parameters panel on the right, locate the **"Credentials"** field.
    3.  Select your existing QuickBooks credential or create a new one.
    4.  Once configured, ensure you select this **same credential** for the other three QuickBooks nodes (`Fetch_30Day_Sales_Receipts`, `Fetch_Yesterday_Invoices`, and `Fetch_Yesterday_Sales_Receipts`).

*   #### **(B) Email Account**
    1.  Navigate to the final node in the workflow, named **`Send_Alert_Email`**.
    2.  In its "Credentials" field, select or create your SMTP/Email account credential.

### Step 2: Configure the Workflow Parameters

*   #### **(A) Set the Anomaly Threshold**
    1.  Click on the **`Check_If_Anomaly`** (IF) node.
    2.  In the parameters, you will see `Value 2` is set to `{{ 40 }}`. This represents a +/- 40% deviation.
    3.  **Action:** Change this number to make the alert more or less sensitive to your needs.

*   #### **(B) Configure the Email Recipient**
    1.  Click on the final node, **`Send_Alert_Email`**.
    2.  Update the **`To Email`** field with the email address (or a comma-separated list of addresses) where alerts should be sent.
    3.  Update the **`From Email`** to your desired sending address.
