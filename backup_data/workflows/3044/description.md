## What Does This Workflow Do?

This automated workflow quickly adds accurate subtitles to your video content by leveraging the Json2Video API.

- It accepts a publicly accessible video URL as input.
- It makes an HTTP request to Json2Video, where AI analyzes the video, generates captions, and applies them seamlessly.
- The workflow returns a URL to the final subtitled video.

The second part of the workflow periodically checks the Json2Video API to monitor the processing status at intervals of 10 seconds.
