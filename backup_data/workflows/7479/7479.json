    "description": "## Description\n\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to turn raw YouTube comments into **research-backed content ideas** complete with **hooks and outlines**.\n\nUse cases include:\n\n* Quickly mining a competitor’s audience for video ideas.  \n* Generating hooks and outlines for your own channel’s comments.  \n* Validating content opportunities with live audience feedback.  \n\n**Good to know**\n\n* Apify is used to scrape YouTube comments (requires an API token).  \n* GPT-4.1-mini is used for both filtering and content generation.  \n* Tavily provides fresh research to ground the AI’s responses.  \n* All outputs are stored in Google Sheets, making it easy to manage and track ideas.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Trigger** – Paste a YouTube URL into the chat trigger.  \n2. **Scrape Comments** – Apify fetches all comments and metadata.  \n3. **Filter** – GPT-4.1-mini decides if each comment could inspire a content idea.  \n4. **Store** – Comments and “Yes/No” decisions are appended to Google Sheets.  \n5. **Research & Enrich** – For “Yes” comments, Tavily provides context, and GPT generates a topic, hook, and outline.  \n6. **Update Sheet** – The same row in Google Sheets is updated with enriched fields.  \n\n---\n\n## Google Sheets Setup  \n\nYour Google Sheet should include these columns (in this order):  \n\n\nid | text | author | likes | isIdea | topic | research | hook | outline\n- **id** – unique identifier for each comment  \n- **text** – the full YouTube comment  \n- **author** – commenter’s name/handle  \n- **likes** – number of likes on the comment  \n- **isIdea** – “Yes” or “No” depending on GPT filter  \n- **topic** – extracted video topic  \n- **research** – 300–500 word background from Tavily  \n- **hook** – engaging opening sentence for a video  \n- **outline** – structured video outline  \n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n* Connect your **Apify**, **OpenAI**, **Tavily**, and **Google Sheets** credentials in n8n.  \n* Point the Google Sheets nodes to your own document and ensure the above headers exist.  \n* Replace sample API keys with your own stored in n8n Credentials.  \n\n**Time to set up:** \\~15–25 minutes for a first-time n8n user (less if you already have credentials handy).  \n\n---\n\n## Customizing this workflow  \n\n* **Filter logic** – Loosen the GPT filter to allow borderline ideas, or tighten it to only accept the best ones.  \n* **Research depth** – Change Tavily’s search depth (e.g., `depth: basic` vs `depth: advanced`) to control how detailed the background research is.  \n* **Notification channels** – Send new “Yes” ideas directly to **Slack** (`#content-ideas`), **Notion** (your content board), or **Email** (notify the content manager instantly).  \n* **Alternative outputs** – Instead of hooks/outlines, generate:  \n  - A **script draft** for YouTube Shorts.  \n  - **Blog post angles** based on the same audience comments.  \n  - A **poll question** for community engagement.  \n",

Once the topic is extracted, use the Tavily tool to perform real-time research based on that topic.\n\nBased on your findings, return a structured JSON object that includes:\n- A clear and compelling video topic derived from the comment  \n- A 300–500 word research overview that:  \n  - Expands on the topic with current, factual information  \n  - Includes recent trends, statistics, and real-world examples (citing sources like “according to [source]”)  \n  - Maintains an educational, unbiased, and informative tone  \n  - Highlights why the topic is timely, interesting, or useful for a broad audience  \n\n## Output Instructions:  \n- Your ONLY output should be a JSON object with the keys: `topic` and `research_overview`.  \n- Do not include any setup text, notes, or formatting outside of the JSON object.  \n- Ensure the research overview is between 300–500 words and tightly aligned with the topic.  \n\n## Example Workflow:  \n1) Receive a YouTube comment (e.g., “Everyone’s ditching Ozempic for berberine. Is that stuff legit?”)  \n2) Extract the core topic implied by the comment (e.g., “Berberine vs Ozempic for weight loss”)  \n3) Use Tavily to search for up-to-date and credible information about the topic  \n4) Write a 300–500 word summary that outlines background, recent developments, and key takeaways  \n5) Return the result in this exact format:  \n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"Berberine vs Ozempic: Why This Natural Supplement is Gaining Popularity in Weight Loss Conversations\",\n  \"research_overview\": \"Berberine, a compound found in several plants, has recently gained traction as a potential natural alternative to Ozempic, a GLP-1 receptor agonist.
