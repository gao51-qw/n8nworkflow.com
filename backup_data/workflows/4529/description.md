This n8n workflow captures Partnerstack events via a webhook, logs the event data into a Google Sheet, and sends a Telegram notification.

### How it Works:

1.  **Webhook Node (Trigger)**: Listens for incoming POST requests. When an event occurs in Partnerstack (e.g., a new referral signs up), the workflow is triggered, capturing the event data.

2.  **Append Row in Sheets Node**: Takes the received Partnerstack event data and appends it as a new row to a designated Google Sheet. This creates a historical log of all captured events.

3.  **Set Chat ID Node**: Defines the specific Telegram chat ID where notifications will be sent.

4.  **Send Notification Node (Telegram)**: Sends a message to the specified Telegram chat. The message content includes details from the Partnerstack event, providing real-time alerts.

### Setup Requirements:

* **Partnerstack Postback**: Configure a postback in Partnerstack (`My account &gt; Postbacks &gt; Create a postback`). Paste the URL provided by n8n's **Webhook** node. Select the Partnerstack events you wish to track.
* **Google Sheets Authentication**: Provide n8n with Google credentials that have write access to your target Google Sheet. Specify the sheet name.
* **Telegram Integration**: You'll need a Telegram bot token (from BotFather) and the specific chat ID for the destination Telegram chat/channel.

#### Additional Notes:

This workflow efficiently automates logging of Partnerstack activities and provides immediate team awareness through Telegram notifications, streamlining event monitoring and response.
