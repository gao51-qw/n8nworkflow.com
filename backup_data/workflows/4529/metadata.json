  "description": "This n8n workflow captures Partnerstack events via a webhook, logs the event data into a Google Sheet, and sends a Telegram notification.\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1.  **Webhook Node (Trigger)**: Listens for incoming POST requests. When an event occurs in Partnerstack (e.g., a new referral signs up), the workflow is triggered, capturing the event data.\n\n2.  **Append Row in Sheets Node**: Takes the received Partnerstack event data and appends it as a new row to a designated Google Sheet. This creates a historical log of all captured events.\n\n3.  **Set Chat ID Node**: Defines the specific Telegram chat ID where notifications will be sent.\n\n4.  **Send Notification Node (Telegram)**: Sends a message to the specified Telegram chat. The message content includes details from the Partnerstack event, providing real-time alerts.\n\n### Setup Requirements:\n\n* **Partnerstack Postback**: Configure a postback in Partnerstack (`My account &gt; Postbacks &gt; Create a postback`). Paste the URL provided by n8n's **Webhook** node. Select the Partnerstack events you wish to track.\n* **Google Sheets Authentication**: Provide n8n with Google credentials that have write access to your target Google Sheet. Specify the sheet name.\n* **Telegram Integration**: You'll need a Telegram bot token (from BotFather) and the specific chat ID for the destination Telegram chat/channel.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n\nThis workflow efficiently automates logging of Partnerstack activities and provides immediate team awareness through Telegram notifications, streamlining event monitoring and response.\n\n### 👉 Need Help?\nFeel free to contact us at [1 Node](https://1node.ai).\nGet instant access to a library of [free resources](https://1node.ai/resources) we created.",
