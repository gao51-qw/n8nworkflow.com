This workflow powers a fully automated WhatsApp chatbot using a self-hosted Venom Bot instead of the official WhatsApp Business API. It integrates Google Gemini AI to generate intelligent, conversational responses and optionally pulls factual information from a Google Docs-based knowledge base. Designed for small businesses and creators, the bot can maintain contextual memory across messages and act as a smart virtual assistant for sales, support, and lead generation.

**Overview**

This n8n workflow connects with a custom-hosted Venom Bot that simulates WhatsApp Web to send and receive messages. It uses a Webhook trigger to receive incoming messages, processes them with an AI Agent powered by Gemini, optionally pulls extra data from a Google Doc or Google Sheet, and sends a smart reply back through the Venom Bot. The workflow also includes a memory system to retain user context, making it capable of handling follow-up questions and dynamic conversations.
