Put your productivity on autopilot with this workflow.

## How it works

This workflow generates a beautifully formatted **daily briefing email** every morning at 6:00 AM by combining your **Todoist tasks** and **Google Calendar events**, summarizing them using **GPT-4o**, and sending them as a clean **HTML email**.

It includes:
- Auto-fetching today's tasks and events
- Formatting them for context
- Generating a motivational summary with GPT-4o
- Converting the output into styled HTML
- Emailing it to you daily

## Set up steps

1. Connect your **Google Calendar** and **Todoist** accounts
2. Set your **project ID** in the Todoist node
3. Customize the OpenAI prompt or email template if needed
4. Enable the **Schedule Trigger** to automate daily runs

All configuration logic and summaries are explained in **sticky notes** inside the workflow.

No external tools required. Just plug, personalize, and automate your day!
