Who is this for
This workflow is perfect for busy professionals, consultants, and anyone who frequently travels between meetings. If you want to make the most of your free time between appointments and discover great nearby spots without manual searching, this template is for you.
What it does
This workflow automatically monitors your Google Calendar and identifies gaps between appointments. When it detects sufficient free time (configurable, default 30+ minutes), it calculates travel time to your next destination, checks the weather, and uses AI to recommend the top 3 spots to visit during your break. Recommendations are weather-aware: indoor spots like cafés in malls or stations for rainy days, and outdoor terraces or open-air venues for nice weather.
How it works

Schedule Trigger - Runs every 30 minutes to check your calendar
Fetch Data - Gets your next calendar event and user preferences from Notion
Calculate Gap Time - Determines available free time by subtracting travel time (via Google Maps) from time until your next appointment
Weather Check - Gets current weather at your destination using OpenWeatherMap
Smart Routing - Routes to indoor or outdoor spot search based on weather conditions
AI Recommendations - GPT-4.1-mini analyzes spots and generates personalized top 3 recommendations
Slack Notification - Sends a friendly message with recommendations to your Slack channel
