  "description": "## Who This Workflow Is For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for YouTube creators, automation builders, and marketers who want to produce short AI-generated videos automatically. It’s especially useful for channels that publish frequent Shorts-style content or want to automate the entire video creation and posting process without manual scripting, editing, or uploading.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nThis automation creates short AI videos by combining Gemini-generated scripts with KIE AI’s text-to-video rendering. It generates a title, description, and video prompt, sends the prompt to KIE AI to create the video, and then automatically uploads the finished result to your YouTube channel using Blotato.\n\nEach run generates a new video concept selected from a predefined set of templates, providing ongoing variety and fresh content. The workflow handles idea generation, video rendering, polling, media upload, and publishing from start to finish.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger** starts the workflow based on your chosen frequency.\n2. **Randomizer** selects one creative template from several predefined options.\n3. **Gemini Prompter** generates a title, description, and structured video prompt.\n4. **KIE AI** renders the video using the Sora-style text-to-video model.\n5. **Polling + Wait** retrieves the completed video once rendering finishes.\n6. **Blotato** uploads and publishes the final video to your connected YouTube channel.\n\n## How to Set Up\n\n* Add your **Google Gemini**, **KIE AI**, and **Blotato** API credentials.\n* Connect your YouTube channel inside Blotato.\n* Adjust the schedule (e.g., every 6–12 hours).\n* Edit or expand prompt templates inside the Prompter node.\n* Activate the workflow to allow fully automated video generation and publishing.\n\n## Customization Ideas\n\n* Add logging to Google Sheets or Notion.\n* Add Telegram, email, or Discord notifications when a new video is posted.\n* Change video length, aspect ratio, or watermark settings in the Create video node.\n* Expand your creative template list to increase content variety.\n\n---\n",
