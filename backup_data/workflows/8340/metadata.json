  "description": "## Get Forex Factory News Release to Telegram\n### This n8n template demonstrates how to capture Actual Data Releases as quickly as possible for trading decisions.\n\n### Use cases:\n1. Get notified if the actual data release is positive or negative for the relevant currency.\n2. Use the Telegram chat message about the news release as a trigger to open a trading position in MetaTrader 4.\n\n### How it works\n* A news release event acts as the trigger.\n* Only news with a numerical Forecast value will be processed. Events that cannot be measured numerically (e.g., speeches) are ignored.\n* Extract news details: currency, impact level (high/medium), release date, and news link.\n* Wait 10 seconds to ensure the Actual value is available on the news page.\n* Scrape the Actual value from the news link using Airtop.\n* If the Actual value is not available, wait another 5 seconds and retry scraping.\n* Extract both Actual and Forecast values from the scraped content.\n* Remove non-numeric characters (%, K, M, B, T) and convert values to numbers.\n* Determine the effect:\nIf the Actual value is lower than the Forecast value (and lower is better), send it to the True branch.\nOtherwise, send it to the False branch.\n\n### How to use\n* Enter all required credentials.\n* Run the workflow.\n\n### Requirements\n* Google Calendar credentials\n* Airtop API key\n* Telegram Chat ID\n* Telegram Bot API token\n\n### Need Help?\nJoin the [Discord](https://discord.gg/n8n) or ask in the [Forum](https://community.n8n.io/)!\n\nThank you!\n\n### Update Sept 26, 2025:\n* Add new edit node",
