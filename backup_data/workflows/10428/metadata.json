  "description": "## 📩 Automatically Log Transactions from Gmail into Notion and Get Telegram Alerts\n\n### Who’s it for  \nThis workflow is for individuals or entrepreneurs who receive **bank alerts, invoices, and payment emails** in Gmail and want them to be **automatically organized in Notion** — while also receiving quick **Telegram notifications** for each transaction.  \n\nIf you manage personal or business finances and find it tedious to manually record every debit, credit, or invoice — this automation does it all for you.\n\n---\n\n### How it works  \nThe workflow acts as an **AI-powered Accountant Agent** that reads incoming Gmail messages and decides whether each email represents a **Debit Transaction, Credit Transaction, Debit Invoice, or Credit Invoice**.  \n\n- The **Gmail Trigger** watches your selected inboxes (like `forwarding@bayesian-labs.com`, `support@bayesian-labs`, `anoop.karnik@bayesian-labs`).  \n- The **Classifier (GPT-5-nano)** determines the correct transaction type.  \n- The appropriate **Agent (GPT-5)** then extracts amount, currency, and description details.  \n- The Agent uses Notion API tools to log structured data into your **Personal Finance System** Notion template (Financial Transactions & Income databases).  \n- Finally, a **Telegram notification** is sent summarizing the entry (From, To, Subject, Snippet).  \n\nIn short: every time your bank emails you — Notion gets updated, and you get notified.\n\n---\n\n### How to set up  \n\n1. **Duplicate the [Personal Finance System Notion template](https://www.notion.so/templates/personal-finance-system)** into your workspace.  \n2. Create a **Telegram Bot** with BotFather → copy the bot token and your chat ID.  \n3. Generate an **OpenRouter API key** for GPT-5 / GPT-5-nano.  \n4. Create a **Notion Integration Token** and connect it to your duplicated finance databases.  \n5. Add your **Gmail accounts** (`forwarding@`, `support@`, and/or personal Gmail) under **Gmail OAuth2 credentials** in n8n.  \n6. Import the workflow JSON into n8n → fill in the credential names as listed below:  \n   - `n8n_cloud_regular_usage` → OpenRouter  \n   - `Notion account` → Notion API  \n   - `Accountant AI` → Telegram Bot  \n   - Gmail OAuth2 for each inbox trigger  \n\nOnce active, n8n polls Gmail every minute, classifies emails, updates Notion, and sends Telegram updates.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements  \n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)  \n- Gmail accounts connected via OAuth2  \n- OpenRouter API key  \n- Telegram bot token & chat ID  \n- Notion integration token  \n- Your duplicated **Personal Finance System Notion template**\n\n---\n\n### How to customize the workflow  \nYou can extend this workflow to:  \n- Track **credit card statements**, **subscriptions**, or **payroll notifications**.  \n- Add **Slack or WhatsApp** alerts alongside Telegram.  \n- Include **live FX rates** for USD→INR conversion using an API node.  \n- Connect **Google Sheets** as a backup ledger or export target.  \n- Add **error-handling branches** to mark Gmail messages as processed or label them “Logged to Notion”.\n",
