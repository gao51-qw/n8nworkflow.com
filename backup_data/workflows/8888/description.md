# Automated Blog Content Generation from Google Trends to WordPress

This n8n workflow automatically generates SEO-friendly blog content based on trending topics from Google Trends and publishes it to WordPress. Perfect for content creators, bloggers, and digital marketers who want to stay on top of trending topics with minimal manual effort.

## Who's it for

- **Content creators** who need fresh, trending topic ideas
- **Bloggers** looking to automate their content pipeline
- **Digital marketers** wanting to capitalize on trending searches
- **WordPress site owners** seeking automated content generation
- **SEO professionals** who want to target trending keywords

## How it works

The workflow operates on a scheduled basis (daily at 8:45 PM by default) and follows this process:

1. **Trend Discovery**: Fetches the latest trending searches from Google Trends for a specific country (Iran by default)
2. **Content Research**: Performs Google searches on the top 3 trending topics to gather detailed information
3. **AI Content Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to create SEO-friendly blog posts based on the trending topics and search results
4. **Structured Output**: Ensures the generated content has proper title and content structure
5. **Auto-Publishing**: Automatically creates draft posts in WordPress

The AI is specifically prompted to create engaging, SEO-optimized content without revealing the automated sources, ensuring natural-sounding blog posts.

## How to set up

1. **Install required community node**:
   - `n8n-nodes-serpapi` for Google Trends and Search functionality


2. **Configure credentials**:

   - **OpenAI**: Add your OpenAI API key for GPT-4o access

3. **Customize the country code**: Change the "Country" field in the "Edit Fields" node (currently set to "IR" for Iran)

4. **Adjust the schedule**: Modify the "Schedule Trigger" to run at your preferred time
