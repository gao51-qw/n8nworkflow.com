  "description": "## How it works\n1. **Fetch campaign & members** from Salesforce.\n2. **GPT‑4** auto‑writes a channel‑appropriate, personalised outbound message.\n3. **Switch** node sends via Twilio (SMS/WhatsApp), SMTP (Email).\n4. **Mark** each member as processed to avoid double‑touches.\n5. **Error trigger** notifies Slack if anything fails.\n\n## Set‑up steps\n1. **Time**: ~10‑15 min once credentials are ready.\n2. **Prereqs**: Active Salesforce OAuth app, Twilio account, SMTP creds, Slack app.\n3. **In‑flow sticky notes** walk you through credential mapping, environment variables, and optional tweaks (e.g., campaign SOQL filter).\n\n&gt; Copy the workflow, add your keys, and run a quick manual test—after that you can place it on a cron or Salesforce trigger.",
