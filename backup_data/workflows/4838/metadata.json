  "description": "Enable smart, real-time answers in your WhatsApp groups using a custom webhook, Pinecone vector database, and no Facebook Business setup.\n\n&gt; 🟡 **Note:** This template uses a *custom WhatsApp webhook*. It does **not** use the official WhatsApp Business API.  \n\n---\n\n## 👥 Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for individuals and teams who want to enable smart WhatsApp group automation — without going through Meta’s official WhatsApp Business API. Ideal for small businesses, internal teams, communities, and personal power users.\n\n---\n\n## ❓ What problem is this solving?\n\nSetting up WhatsApp bots with intelligent responses often requires approval from Meta and a verified business account. This workflow removes those barriers by using a self-hosted webhook to handle incoming messages and respond using a document-trained AI via Pinecone.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\n- Connects a regular WhatsApp number to a custom webhook  \n- Adds the bot to any group chat (it stays silent unless mentioned)  \n- Indexes documents from Google Drive into Pinecone  \n- Responds with intelligent, context-aware answers from your custom knowledge base  \n- Auto-updates its knowledge every minute as the document changes  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup\n\n### Step 1: Connect Google Drive\n\n- Set up your [Google Drive credentials in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/)\n\n### Step 2: Configure Pinecone\n\n1. Create an index in Pinecone  \n   - **Dimension:** `1536`  \n2. Select this index in **both** Pinecone nodes  \n3. Click **Test Workflow** to ingest your document into Pinecone  \n\n### Step 3: Get Access to the WhatsApp Webhook\n\n- Fill out [this form to request access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-bW5tSJu_rRvJ4NmFrxXSAwaNbO7MbGJtUIS-mBA23B7BWQ/viewform?usp=dialog)  \n- You’ll receive a WhatsApp confirmation for linking  \n\n### Step 4: Test WhatsApp Integration\n\n- ✅ *One-on-one test:* Send a message from another number  \n- 👥 *Group test:* Add the bot to a group; it will only respond when tagged  \n\n---\n\n## 🧩 How to customize this workflow\n\n- Modify the **system prompt** inside the AI agent node to control tone and behavior  \n- Update the connected Google Doc to match your specific domain (e.g. FAQs, SOPs, product manuals)  \n- Adjust the Pinecone sync frequency if you want updates more or less often  \n\n---\n\n## 📚 Use cases\n\n- **Customer Support**: Instant, intelligent replies in WhatsApp without live agents  \n- **Team Knowledge Bot**: Tag the bot for quick access to SOPs and internal docs  \n- **Community Groups**: Automate common questions while keeping noise low  \n- **Personal AI Assistant**: A WhatsApp chatbot trained on your notes and files  \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Sticky Note Suggestion\n\n 💬 **What this template does:**  \n&gt; Enables an AI bot in your WhatsApp group that answers questions based on a Google Doc you provide. It uses a custom webhook, Google Drive, and Pinecone.  \n\n🔧 **Requirements:**  \n&gt;  Google Drive account  \n&gt;  Pinecone account with an index (dimension 1536)  \n&gt; Access to the custom WhatsApp webhook (see setup steps)  \n",
