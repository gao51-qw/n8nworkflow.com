## Generate Invoices for Customers with Jotform, Xero and Gmail
This workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **Xero**, generating an invoice, and emailing it — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**).

## How It Works
1. **Receive Submission**

- Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.

2. **Create/Update The Customer**
- Creates/Updates the customer.

3. **Create The Invoice**
- Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.

4. **Send The Invoice**
- Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.
