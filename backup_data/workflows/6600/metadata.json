  "description": "## Upwork Messages Notifications (Gmail to Slack) - Fully Automated Alerts\n\nThis n8n workflow streamlines how you receive Upwork client messages, sending instant notifications to Slack. It demonstrates two approaches: a code-based extraction and an AI-powered one with Google Gemini.\n\n---\n\n### Use Cases\n\n* **Instant Communication:** Get real-time alerts for new Upwork client messages in your team's Slack channel.\n* **Improved Responsiveness:** Quickly respond to client inquiries and maintain strong communication.\n* **Centralized Notifications:** Keep all your essential work-related notifications in one place.\n\n### Good to Know\n\n* The workflow is set to poll your Gmail every *3 minutes* for unread Upwork messages, which can be reduced or increased.\n* The **AI Information Extractor** with Google Gemini provides a more refined and robust method for data parsing compared to custom code.\n* Usage of Google Gemini may incur costs. Refer to [Gemini Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) for updated information.\n* Google Gemini models can be geo-restricted. If you encounter a \"model not found\" error, it might not be available in your region.\n\n### How it Works\n\n**Method 1: Code-Based Extraction**\n\n1.  **Gmail Trigger:** The workflow starts by monitoring your Gmail for new, unread emails from \"via Upwork\".\n2.  **Code Node:** A custom JavaScript code block is used to extract the client's name and the message content directly from the email's text.\n3.  **Slack Notification:** The extracted client name and message are then formatted and sent as a new message to a designated Slack channel.\n\n**Method 2: AI-Powered Extraction with Google Gemini (Recommended)**\n\n1.  **Gmail Trigger X:** Similar to Method 1, this part also triggers on new unread Upwork emails.\n2.  **Information Extractor (AI):** This powerful node, powered by Google Gemini, takes the entire email text and intelligently extracts structured information like the \"client\" name and the \"message\" content based on a defined schema. This method is more robust and requires less manual parsing logic.\n3.  **Google Gemini Chat Model:** (Implicitly used by the Information Extractor) This node provides the underlying AI capabilities for intelligent information extraction.\n4.  **Send to Slack X:** The refined output from the AI Information Extractor (client name and message) is then sent to a Slack channel.\n\n### How to Use\n\n1.  **Gmail Credentials:** Ensure you have configured your Gmail OAuth2 credentials in n8n for both \"Gmail Trigger\" nodes.\n2.  **Slack Credentials:** Set up your Slack OAuth2 credentials in n8n for both \"Send to Slack\" nodes and select the desired Slack channel.\n3.  **Google Gemini Credentials:** For the AI-powered workflow, you'll need to set up your Google Gemini API key as a credential in n8n.\n4.  **Activate Workflows:** Enable both workflows in n8n to start receiving notifications. You can compare the output quality of each method.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n* **Gmail Account** connected to Upwork notifications.\n* **Slack Workspace** and a designated channel for notifications.\n* **Google Gemini API key** for the AI-powered extraction workflow.",
