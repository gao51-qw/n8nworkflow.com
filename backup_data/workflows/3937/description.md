**Community Node Disclaimer**: This workflow uses KlickTipp community nodes.

#### How It Works

This workflow automates personalized WhatsApp message template delivery triggered by events in KlickTipp or by messages sent to the Whatsapp Business account. When a contact triggers an Outbound, the workflow uses a pre-approved WhatsApp message template to send dynamic, real-time messages through the WhatsApp Business Cloud API. When receiving messages it checks whether a cancellation should be processed or if a auto-response is sent.

This setup is ideal for time-sensitive campaigns such as:
- Birthday greetings
- Discount or promo notifications
- Follow-ups on product or service interest

#### Key Features

**KlickTipp Trigger**
- Starts the workflow when a specific outbound is triggered
- Typical use case: subcriber receives activation Tag and triggers an Outbound which sends a webhook call to trigger WhatsApp messaging.

**WhatsApp Business Cloud - Message Trigger**
- Listens to messages from the contact and processes answers with answering auto-responder or by tagging the contact in KlickTipp.

**WhatsApp Business Cloud - Sending Template Messages**
- Sends  WhatsApp message templates using a pre-approved template.
- Template placeholders are filled with data from KlickTipp custom fields.


#### Setup Instructions

1. Set up the KlickTipp and Whatsapp nodes in your n8n instance.

2. Trigger the Outbound in KlickTipp using the activation tag and answer with a message to the template.
