### Context

Hi! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com) — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

I help logistics teams reduce operational workload and errors by combining **AI automation**, **route optimisation APIs**, and **workflow automation**.

This workflow is part of a **circular economy project**, where stores return **reusable packaging** (bins, crates, containers) to a central warehouse.

&gt; Let's create circular economies with AI-powered automation using n8n!

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is designed for logistics teams participating in **circular economy loops**.

Let us imagine your transportation company receives this **pickup request**:

[![Example of Results](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-15.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)

The two **AI Agent nodes** connected to **Openroute Service API** will process the information and reply with the **detailed route plan**.

The results include **driving time** and the **optimal sequence** of stops generated by the multi-stop optimization endpoint of the API.

### How does it work?

This workflow automates the end-to-end processing of **multi-stop pickup requests for reusable packaging**:

- 📨 Gmail Trigger listens for collection request emails  
- 🧠 AI Agent parses the email into structured data (store ID, address, date)  
- 📍 Each stop is geocoded into GPS coordinates  
- 🗺️ OpenRouteService **optimizes the stop sequence** using truck-specific routing  
- 📄 A second AI Agent formats a **confirmation email in HTML** with the ordered pickup plan  
- 📧 The reply is sent back with all details including duration and route

### Steps:

1. 💌 Trigger on a new Gmail message  
2. 🧠 Extract data using AI Agent (e.g., stores, addresses, times)  
3. 📑 Store raw and processed data in Google Sheets  
4. 📍 Enrich with GPS coordinates  
5. 🚚 Optimize route using OpenRouteService (truck profile)  
6. 📄 Format the confirmation using an AI Agent  
7. 📬 Send reply to requester with route and timing

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:

- A **Gmail account** to receive collection requests  
- A **Google Sheet** to store and review data  
- A free [OpenRouteService API key](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup)  
- Access to OpenAI for using AI Agent nodes  
- Sample pickup request emails to test

### Next Steps

🗒️ Use the sticky notes inside the n8n canvas to:

- Plug in your Gmail and OpenRouteService credentials  
- Try with a sample store collection email  
- Validate the confirmation format and route accuracy
