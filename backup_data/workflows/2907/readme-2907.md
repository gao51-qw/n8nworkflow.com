# A very simple "Human in the Loop" email response system using AI and IMAP

> ### **Functionality**
This workflow automates the handling of incoming emails by summarizing their content, generating appropriate responses, and validating the responses through a "Human-in-the-Loop" system. It integrates with IMAP email services (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) and uses AI models to streamline the email response process.

The workflow ensures that all AI-generated responses are reviewed by a human before being sent, maintaining a high level of professionalism and accuracy. This approach is particularly useful for businesses that receive a high volume of emails and need to respond quickly while ensuring quality control.

### **How It Works**
1. **Email Trigger**:
   - The workflow starts with the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node, which monitors an email inbox for new messages. When a new email arrives, it triggers the workflow.

2. **Email Preprocessing**:
   - The **Markdown** node converts the email's HTML content into plain text for easier processing by the AI models.

3. **Email Summarization**:
   - The **Email Summarization Chain** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to generate a concise summary of the email. The summary is limited to 100 words and is written in a professional tone.

4. **Email Response Generation**:
   - The **Write email** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to draft a professional response to the email. The response is based on the email content and is limited to 100 words.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Approval**:
   - The **Set Email text** node prepares the drafted response for approval.
   - The **Approve Email** node sends the drafted response to a human approver (e.g., an internal email address) for review. The email includes:
     - The original message.
     - The AI-generated response.
   - The **Approved?** node checks if the response has been approved by the human reviewer. If approved, the workflow proceeds to send the response; otherwise, it stops.

6. **Sending the Response**:
   - The **Send Email** node sends the approved response back to the original sender.
