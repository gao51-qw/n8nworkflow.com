  "description": "## Use case\nn8n workflows can go out of hand when you're automating as much as we do at n8n. We needed a place to document them and keep track of who owns and maintains them. To facilitate this we use this n8n workflow to automatically sync workflows directly to a Notion database if it has the tag `sync-to-notion`.\n\n![Screenshot 20240228 at 21.03.27.png](fileId:756)![Screenshot 20240228 at 21.03.21.png](fileId:757)\n\n## How to setup\n1. Add your n8n api creds\n2. Add your Notion creds \n3. Create notion database with fields `env id` as `text`, `isActive (dev)` as `boolean`, `URL (dev)` as `url`, `Workflow created at` as `date`, `Workflow updated at` as `date`, `Error workflow setup` as `boolean` \n (Make sure page is connected)\n4. Add tag `sync-to-notion` to some workflows",
