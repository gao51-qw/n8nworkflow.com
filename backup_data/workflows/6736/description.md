## Understanding This Workflow

- In simple terms, this workflow triggers when you receive an e-mail in your inbox; classifies this e-mail based on the subject and notifies you using Telegram. It's fully customizable so you can change, add categoies and continue each data flow separately.

- E-Mails can hold pretty important information. But one can forget to check-up or rather not prefer to do so. This workflow keeps you updated of what's most important to you. Not only that, you can always talk to the bot to checkup on E-Mails you've missed.

### Set Up Overview
- **IMAP E-Mail Trigger:** You can switch to a Gmail node aswell.
- **Google Sheets:** Google Sheets is easy to use so I recommend you to keep it.
- **AI Model:** Use any model of your preferance. As long as it is smart and uses less tokens.
- **Telegram:** Refer to documentation to understand how to create a bot.

	&gt; There is no correct line of setting up these credentials, as the workflow needs all to work; as long as you don't change the logic of the workflow.

#### Note
