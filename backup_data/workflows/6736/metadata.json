  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## Understanding This Workflow\n\n- In simple terms, this workflow triggers when you receive an e-mail in your inbox; classifies this e-mail based on the subject and notifies you using Telegram. It's fully customizable so you can change, add categoies and continue each data flow separately.\n\n- E-Mails can hold pretty important information. But one can forget to check-up or rather not prefer to do so. This workflow keeps you updated of what's most important to you. Not only that, you can always talk to the bot to checkup on E-Mails you've missed.\n\n### Set Up Overview\n- **IMAP E-Mail Trigger:** You can switch to a Gmail node aswell.\n- **Google Sheets:** Google Sheets is easy to use so I recommend you to keep it.\n- **AI Model:** Use any model of your preferance. As long as it is smart and uses less tokens.\n- **Telegram:** Refer to documentation to understand how to create a bot.\n\n\t&gt; There is no correct line of setting up these credentials, as the workflow needs all to work; as long as you don't change the logic of the workflow.\n\n#### Note\nPlease refer to the sticky notes in the workflow for a clear guide on setup, workflow description etc. If you need any help or need a hand, you can always message me. \n&gt;https://community.n8n.io/u/mookie_lian",
