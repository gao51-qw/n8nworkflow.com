# **Automation Flow: Image to Image Using GPT Sora**

This flow automates the process of generating images using a provided prompt and reference image via the **Sora GPT Image API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-gpt-image). The generated images are stored in **Google Drive**, and details are logged in **Google Sheets**.

## **Nodes Overview**

### 1. **On Form Submission**
- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger`
- **Description**: This node triggers when a user submits the form containing the prompt and image URL. It ensures the form fields are filled in and ready for processing.
  - **Form Fields**:
    - **Prompt**: A text description of the desired image.
    - **Image URL**: The URL of the reference image to be used.
  - **Webhook ID**: Unique identifier for form submission.

### 3. **Code (Base64 Conversion)**
- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.code`
- **Description**: This node processes the base64-encoded image data returned from the API. It decodes and formats the image to be uploaded to Google Drive.
  - **Output**: Converts the base64 string into a binary JPEG file.

---

### 4. **Upload Image to Google Drive**
- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.googleDrive`
- **Description**: Uploads the generated image to **Google Drive**, storing it in a designated folder.
  - **Authentication**: Google Service Account.
  - **File Name**: The image file name is dynamically set from the previous node.

---

### 5. **Log Details to Google Sheets**
- **Type**: `n8n-nodes-base.googleSheets`
- **Description**: This node logs the **Prompt**, **Generated Image**, and **Generation Date** into a **Google Sheets** document for tracking and auditing purposes.
  - **Columns Mapped**:
    - **Prompt**: The user’s input text.
    - **Image**: The name of the generated image file.
    - **Generated Date**: Date and time of image generation.

---

## **Flow Summary**
1. **User Submits Form**: Triggered when the form with the prompt and image URL is submitted.
2. **Image Generation**: The data is sent to the **Sora GPT Image API** from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/skdeveloper/api/sora-gpt-image) to generate the image.
3. **Image Processing**: The generated image (base64 format) is decoded and saved as a file.
4. **Google Drive Upload**: The image is uploaded to **Google Drive** for storage.
5. **Google Sheets Logging**: All relevant details (Prompt, Image, Date) are saved in **Google Sheets**.
