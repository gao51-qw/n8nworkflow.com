## AI-Enhanced Lead Qualification & HubSpot Synchronization (Jotform to HubSpot) 🧠✨

Stop wasting time on bad leads and manual research. This advanced **n8n workflow** automates your entire lead qualification and CRM entry process for HubSpot, ensuring you only sync **high-quality, pre-researched contacts**.

When a prospect submits your form, this automation immediately:

1.  **Verifies the lead's email** using Verifalia to ensure deliverability.
2.  **Performs an AI-powered website crawl** to extract and structure key competitive information like the prospect's **Company Name**, **Industry**, **Country**, and a **Website Summary**.
3.  **Uses Google Gemini to create an instant, personalized summary** of the lead's potential, acting as your *virtual sales assistant*.
4.  Finally, it creates or updates the comprehensive, enhanced contact record in **HubSpot CRM** and sends a smart **Gmail notification** to your sales team with the AI summary for immediate, informed follow-up.

## How it Works

This automation turns raw form submissions into fully enriched, sales-ready contacts in HubSpot:

1.  **Lead Capture (Jotform):** A prospect fills out your Jotform with their details, triggering the workflow instantly.
2.  **Email Verification (Verifalia):** The email address is sent to the Verifalia API. **Only verified, deliverable emails are allowed to proceed**, eliminating bad data from your HubSpot portal.
3.  **Website Crawl & Data Extraction (HTTP Request & AI):** The workflow accesses the prospect's website and uses an **Information Extractor** (powered by an underlying Language Model like Google Gemini or similar AI) to automatically pull essential business data like **Industry** and **Company Name**.
4.  **AI Lead Scoring & Summarization (Google Gemini):** All captured and enriched data is fed to the Google Gemini model. The AI acts as a smart assistant, analyzing the lead's profile to generate a **short, prospective summary** for your sales team.
5.  **HubSpot Synchronization:** The final, enriched contact data (including all AI-extracted fields) is used to either **create a new contact** or **update an existing one** in your **HubSpot CRM**.
6.  **Intelligent Internal Notification (Gmail):** Your sales team receives an immediate internal email. This alert contains the raw lead data **plus the critical AI-generated summary**, allowing them to prioritize and personalize their follow-up immediately.
