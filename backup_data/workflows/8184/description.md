A **lean, 3-node automation** that turns voice memos into tweets — so creators can capture ideas on the go and publish fast, without typing.


Capture inspiration the moment it strikes — even when you’re not at your desk. This 3-node workflow lets **content creators, coaches, and solopreneurs** turn voice memos into **X (Twitter) posts** automatically.

Just record a voice note, upload it to a Google Drive folder, and n8n will:

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. **Prepare Google Drive Folder**
- Create a folder: `Voice Notes to Tweet`
- Enable **Google Drive API** in your n8n credentials
- Share the folder with your automation account (if needed)

### 2. **Set Up AssemblyAI (or Whisper)**
- Sign up at [assemblyai.com](https://www.assemblyai.com/)
- Get your API key
- In n8n, add a credential for **HTTP Request** or use a dedicated node

&gt; 🔁 Alternative: Use OpenAI’s Whisper API if preferred

### 3. **Connect X (Twitter) Account**
- Use n8n’s **X (Twitter) node**
- Authenticate with your app key, secret, access token
- Ensure **write permissions**

### 4. **Deploy the Workflow**
- Import the JSON below
- Replace placeholder credentials:
  - `{{GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID}}`
  - `{{ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY}}`
  - `{{TWITTER_CREDENTIAL}}`

Now, every time you upload a `.m4a`, `.mp3`, or `.wav` file to your folder — it becomes a tweet.
