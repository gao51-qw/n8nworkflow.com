# Generate and email PDF invoices from Tally Forms with Google Docs

> **Stop copy-pasting invoice details!**

This gentle workflow turns a simple **Tally form** into a beautiful **PDF invoice** and delivers it to your client before you finish your latte ☕.**

**Perfect for Etsy sellers, coaches, freelancers and side-hustlers who want soft-tech automation that feels like magic, not middleware.**

**How it works**

1️⃣ You (or your VA) fill a 4-question Tally form: client name, email, amount, due date.

2️⃣ n8n instantly merges the data into a Google Docs template you pre-design (logo, colours, your vibe).

3️⃣ PDF is generated & emailed with a warm, on-brand note.

4️⃣ Optional: same PDF is auto-saved to a “2024-Invoices” Google Drive folder for painless bookkeeping 📁.

Zero code, zero Zapier, zero monthly fees—just pure calm productivity.

**Bonus:** template includes placeholder variables so you can add discount lines, PO numbers or custom thank-you messages in seconds.

**Grab it, swap in your own Tally & Gmail credentials, and watch your invoicing shrink from 15 minutes to 15 seconds. Your future self (and your accountant) will send you heart emojis 💌.**
