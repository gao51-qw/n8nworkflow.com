# Automate Reddit brand monitoring & responses with GPT-4o-mini, Sheets & Slack

> ## How it Works

This workflow automates intelligent Reddit marketing by monitoring brand mentions, analyzing sentiment with AI, and engaging authentically with communities. Every 24 hours, the system searches Reddit for posts containing your configured brand keywords across all subreddits, finding up to 50 of the newest mentions to analyze.

Each discovered post is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for comprehensive analysis. The AI evaluates sentiment (positive/neutral/negative), assigns an engagement score (0-100), determines relevance to your brand, and generates contextual, helpful responses that add genuine value to the conversation. It also classifies the response type (educational/supportive/promotional) and provides reasoning for whether engagement is appropriate.

The workflow intelligently filters posts using a multi-criteria system: only posts that are relevant to your brand, score above 60 in engagement quality, and warrant a response type other than "pass" proceed to engagement. This prevents spam and ensures every interaction is meaningful.

Selected posts are processed one at a time through a loop to respect Reddit's rate limits. For each worthy post, the AI-generated comment is posted, and complete interaction data is logged to Google Sheets including timestamp, post details, sentiment, engagement scores, and success status. This creates a permanent audit trail and analytics database.

At the end of each run, the workflow aggregates all data into a comprehensive daily summary report with total posts analyzed, comments posted, engagement rate, sentiment breakdown, and the top 5 engagement opportunities ranked by score. This report is automatically sent to Slack with formatted metrics, giving your team instant visibility into your Reddit marketing performance.
