## ⚙️ Node-by-Node Explanation

### On form submission  
Triggers the automation whenever a user submits the GST-related data (like GSTIN) via a web form. It collects all necessary input for further processing in the workflow.

### Fetch GST Data Using GST Insights API  
Sends a request to the **[GST Insights API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights)** to fetch GST data based on the user's input. This is done via a POST request that includes the required authentication and the inputted GSTIN.

### Data Reformatting  
This node processes and structures the raw [**GST data received from the API**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gst-insights). The reformatting ensures only the essential information (e.g., tax summaries, payment status, etc.) is extracted for reporting.

### Google Docs Reporting  
Generates a Google Docs document and auto-populates it with the reformatted GST data. The report is structured in a clean format, ready for sharing or downloading.
