  "description": "## This template has a two part setup:\n1. Ingest PDF files from S3, extract text, chunk, embed with OpenAI embeddings, and index into a Qdrant collection with metadata.\n2. Provide a chat entry point that uses an Agent with OpenAI to retrieve from the same Qdrant collection as a tool and answer proposal knowledge questions.\n\n## What it does\n- Lists objects in an S3 bucket, loops through keys, downloads each file, and extracts text from PDFs.\n- Chunks text and loads it into Qdrant with metadata for retrieval.\n- Exposes a chat trigger wired to an Agent using an OpenAI chat model.\n- Adds a retrieve as tool Qdrant node so the Agent can ground answers in the indexed corpus.\n\n## Why it is useful\n- Simple pattern for building a proposal or knowledge base from PDFs stored in S3.\n- End to end path from ingestion to retrieval augmented answers.\n- Easy to swap models or collections, and to extend with more tools.\n\n## Setup notes\n- Attach your own AWS credentials to the two S3 nodes and set your bucket name.\n- Attach your Qdrant credentials to both Qdrant nodes and set your collection.\n- Attach your OpenAI credentials to the embedding and chat nodes.\n- The sanitized template uses placeholders for bucket and collection names.",
