  "description": "## Real Working Demo\n\n[https://crmaiinsight.com/leadbot](https://crmaiinsight.com/leadbot)\n# How It Works (High-Level)\n\n1) **Chat &gt; Capture**  \n   LeadBot greets, collects **Full Name → Email → Mobile (optional) → Product interest** via friendly chat (no forms).  \n   - Validates email/phone, confirms inputs, supports corrections.\n\n2) **De-dupe**  \n   Checks Salesforce for an existing lead by **Email**.  \n   - If found → **update_lead**. If not → **create_lead**.\n\n3) **Product Selection**  \n   Pulls your **Feature_Product__c** list (Name + one-line Description) and lets the user choose by **number or name**.\n\n4) **Demo Booking (Optional)**  \n   If the user says **Yes**:  \n   - Detect/ask **Time Zone** (IANA).  \n   - Reads **Salesforce Events** for the next 14 days.  \n   - Computes **free 30-min weekday slots (09:00–17:00 UTC)** strictly after *now*.  \n   - User picks a slot → creates a **Salesforce Event** (30 min) linked to the Lead.\n\n5) **Notifications & Follow-ups**  \n   - **Slack DM** to your team (concise summary).  \n   - **Email** confirmation to the prospect (local date/time included).  \n   - Ends with a polite confirmation message.\n\n---\n\n## Setup at a Glance\n\n- **Effort:** Most teams finish the base setup in **~45–90 minutes** (credentials, field mapping, test).  \n- **What you’ll configure:** Salesforce OAuth, SMTP (or your ESP), Slack, OpenAI key, and the web chat widget.\n\n&gt; Tip: Start with the provided **Feature_Product__c** object. You can switch to your own product catalog with a **few tweaks** (see below).\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Salesforce**  \n  - Connected App + OAuth (API enabled).  \n  - Lead fields: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `MobilePhone`, and **one product lookup/text field** (e.g., `Interested_Product__c` or `Feature_Product__c`).  \n  - (Recommended) Custom object **Feature_Product__c** with fields: `Name`, `Description__c`, `Features__c`, `Tags__c`.\n\n- **n8n Credentials**  \n  - `salesforceOAuth2Api` (to read/write Leads & Events).  \n  - `smtp` (or use your email provider node).  \n  - `slackApi` (for internal notifications).  \n  - `openAiApi` (for the chat agent).\n\n- **Widget Embed (optional)**  \n  - A place on your site/app to embed the chat launcher.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup\n\n1) **Import the flow into n8n**  \n   - Verify nodes: **Chat Trigger → AI Agent → check_duplicate_lead → update/create lead → get_products → get_scheduled_events → create_demo_event → Slack/Email**.\n\n2) **Add/Bind Credentials**\n   - **Salesforce OAuth**: authorize org with API scope.  \n   - **SMTP**: sender, domain, and authentication (verify SPF/DKIM).  \n   - **Slack**: ensure bot can DM users/channels.  \n   - **OpenAI**: drop in your API key.\n\n3) **Map Product Field on Lead**\n   - Pick **one** field to store the selection (e.g., `Interested_Product__c`).  \n   - Ensure **AI Agent** and **Salesforce nodes** reference the **same field**.\n\n4) **(Option A) Use `Feature_Product__c`**\n   - Confirm fields exist: `Name`, `Description__c` (used in the numbered list).  \n   - In **get_products**, make sure **`Id`** is returned; pass it as `customFieldsValues0_Value`.\n\n5) **(Option B) Use Your Own Catalog**\n   - Swap `customObject: Feature_Product__c` → `Product2` (or your object).  \n   - Update **fields** to at least: `Id`, `Name`, and a short description field.  \n   - Keep the **variable contract** the same (AI expects to store `Id`, `name`, `description`).\n\n6) **Configure Demo Booking**\n   - **get_scheduled_events** uses a SOQL search window *(today → +14 days)*.  \n   - Ensure your **Event** permissions allow read/write.  \n   - Confirm **create_demo_event** URL points to your Salesforce domain & API version.\n\n7) **Customize Widget (optional)**\n   - Set **title**, **brand colors**, and **initial message** in the Chat Trigger options.  \n   - Limit reply length (≤100 words) is already set.\n\n8) **Test End-to-End**\n   - Run a full path: enter name/email/phone, pick a product, select a time slot.  \n   - Verify: **Lead/Update** in Salesforce, **Event** creation, **Slack DM**, **Prospect Email**.\n\n---\n\n## Switching to Your Own Products (Quick Tweaks)\n\n- **Replace Data Source:**  \n  - In **get_products**:  \n    - `customObject: Product2` (or your object API name).  \n    - **Fields**: ensure `Id`, `Name`, and a short description are returned.  \n- **Update Lead Field Mapping:**  \n  - Set `Interested_Product__c` (or your chosen field) to the returned **Product Id**.  \n- **Copy Text Logic:**  \n  - Keep the AI’s “numbered list” output; it supports both number and name replies.\n\n---\n\n## What Users Experience\n\n- No forms. A friendly AI asks one thing at a time, confirms details, and offers a **live calendar** of the next available 30-minute demo slots.  \n- The moment they choose, a **Salesforce Event** is created and they get a **confirmation email**.  \n- Your team receives a **Slack heads-up** with who/what/when.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting Quick Checks\n\n- **No product list?** Ensure `Id, Name, Description__c` (or equivalent) are returned by **get_products**.  \n- **No free slots shown?** Confirm Event query window (+14 days), timezone handling, and that “current time” filter excludes past times.  \n- **Lead not updated?** Check the **duplicate search by Email** and that `update_lead` receives `Lead_ID`.  \n- **Event fails to create?** Verify Salesforce API endpoint, OAuth scope, and required Event fields.\n\n---\n\n",
