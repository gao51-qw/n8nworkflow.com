The process is battle-tested, with built-in error handling, and suitable for sales teams, market researchers, or founders conducting competitive analysis.

1. Uses Hunter.io to discover professional emails associated with the domain
2. Leverages Perplexity AI to gather web-wide company intelligence and industry context
3. Scrapes the company website using Airtop to extract services, products, and key pages
4. Optionally enriches with LinkedIn data via Apify (company size, specialties)

   - Calculate an Ideal Service Customer Profile (ISCP) match score
6. Produces a finalized report in Google Docs with:
