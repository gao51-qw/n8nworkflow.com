  "description": "Auto-like and repost latest tweets from accounts in Google Sheets\nWho’s it for\n\nTeams and solo creators who manage multiple X (Twitter) accounts they follow and want consistent engagement with minimal effort. Ideal for social managers, community leads, and campaign operators who need safe, repeatable automation.\n\nWhat it does / How it works\n\nOn a schedule, the workflow reads a Google Sheet of screen names, fetches each account’s latest tweets, then likes and reposts them. A Limit node caps daily actions to respect rate limits and reduce risk. Every step includes Sticky notes: a yellow Overview (full description + safety notes) and white per-step notes (setup tips, filters, and expansion ideas).\n\nHow to set up\n\nAdd Credentials for X (Twitter) OAuth2 and Google Sheets (no hardcoded tokens).\n\nPoint the Google Sheets node to your sheet (header アカウントID, screen names without @).\n\nAdjust the search query (e.g., -is:reply -is:retweet) and results per run.\n\nSet the Schedule Trigger cadence and Limit (start with 1–3).\n\nTest with a staging account, then enable scheduling.\n\nRequirements\n\nn8n 1.x+\n\nX (Twitter) OAuth2 and Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials\n\nA Google Sheet with column アカウントID\n\nHow to customize the workflow\n\nAdd a dry-run flag (Set → IF) to skip actions in testing.\n\nInsert IF filters for NG words, language, or tweet age (created_at).\n\nAdd a Wait node between Like and Repost for cooldowns.\n\nAppend logs to another Google Sheet (status, URL, timestamp).\n\nSecurity & quality: Use Credentials only, avoid personal IDs in nodes, and keep actions modest to respect API limits.",
