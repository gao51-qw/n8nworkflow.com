  "description": "Turn your code commits into engaging social media content automatically. This workflow monitors a GitHub repository, uses AI to write a LinkedIn post about your changes, generates a beautiful \"Mac-window\" style image of your code, and publishes it all to LinkedIn.\n\n## How it works\n1. **GitHub Trigger**: Watches for new `push` events in your selected repository.\n2. **AI Analysis**: Passes the code changes to an LLM (via LangChain) to write a professional LinkedIn post and select the best code snippet.\n3. **Image Generation**: Creates a custom HTML view of your code (with syntax highlighting and window controls) and converts it to an image using the HCTI API.\n4. **Hosting & Posting**: Uploads the generated image back to GitHub for hosting, then combines the text and image to publish a live post on LinkedIn.\n\n## Set up steps\n1. **Configure Credentials**: You will need credentials for:\n   - GitHub (OAuth2 or Access Token)\n   - LinkedIn (OAuth2)\n   - OpenRouter (or swap the model node for OpenAI/Anthropic)\n   - HCTI.io (for the HTML-to-Image conversion)\n2. **Update GitHub Nodes**:\n   - In the **Trigger** node: Set your `Owner` and `Repository`.\n   - In the **File Download** node: Set the same `Owner` and `Repository`.\n   - In the **Upload Image** node: Set the target repo where you want images stored.\n3. **Update LinkedIn Node**:\n   - Add your LinkedIn Person URN in the `Person` field.",
