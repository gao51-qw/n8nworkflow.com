  "description": "## 🧑‍💻 Description\nThis workflow automatically **fetches new Gmail messages since the last run** and appends them into a **Google Sheet** with their ID, snippet, and timestamp.  \n\nIt’s designed for **professionals, small business owners, and operations teams** who need a simple way to keep an ongoing log of emails, build lightweight CRMs, or power downstream automations like **email tracking, reporting, or follow-up reminders**.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions for Gmail → Google Sheets Email Log\n\n### 1️⃣ Connect Gmail\n1. In **n8n → Credentials → New → Gmail OAuth2**  \n2. Log in with your Gmail account & approve access  \n3. Attach this credential to the **Get new messages** node in the workflow  \n\n### 2️⃣ Connect Google Sheets\n1. Copy this [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5VXtbo9g7SvGDPmeZok4HG1K-WI1PS0DNBylzmhVwg/edit?usp=drivesdk) into your own Drive  \n2. In **n8n → Credentials → New → Google Sheets (OAuth2)** → log in with your Google account & save  \n3. In the workflow, select your Spreadsheet ID and Worksheet (Sheet1 by default) in the **Google Sheets nodes**  \n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How Email Logging Automation Works\n- **Get Current Emails** → Reads the last logged messages from Google Sheets  \n- **Get Max Date** → Finds the most recent email timestamp  \n- **Combine** → Passes the last timestamp and today’s date together  \n- **Get New Messages** → Fetches all new Gmail messages after the last logged date  \n- **Add Emails to Sheets** → Appends message ID, snippet, and date to the sheet  \n\n---\n\n## 🎛️ Customization Guidance\n- **Filter by Sender or Subject** → Modify the Gmail query to only log messages from specific addresses or with certain keywords.  \n- **Track Labels** → Add Gmail labels to your sheet to separate categories (e.g., “Leads,” “Support,” “Invoices”).  \n- **Auto-Reply** → Extend with an additional Gmail node to send automated responses to new messages.  \n- **Send Alerts** → Add a Slack or Email node to ping your team whenever a new email is logged.  \n- **Analytics** → Use Google Sheets formulas or connect to BI tools to analyze trends like response times or sender frequency.  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact\nNeed advanced customization (e.g., multi-inbox tracking, CRM integration, or automated follow-ups)?\n\n📧 **robert@ynteractive.com**  \n🔗 **[Robert Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/)**  \n🌐 **[ynteractive.com](https://ynteractive.com)**\n",
