  "description": "## Automated Gmail Labeling and Brainstorming\n\nThis template can be used to **automatically label your incoming Gmail messages with AI** and to **build a knowledge graph** from the emails tagged with a specific label to brainstorm new ideas based on them.\n\nYou can also **get notified about the emails with the most important labels via Telegram** as well as receive new ideas as you are building a knowledge graph of incoming messages.\n\nThe idea generation is based on the **[InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com) content gap detection algorithm**, which builds a network from your content and then finds a blind spot and uses AI to generate an interesting research question or idea that can be used to bridge this gap.\n\n![InfraNodus structural gap](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-structural-gaps-ideas@2x.jpg)\n\n\n## Why it works so well?\n\nThink of all the business emails you receive that bypass the spam filters. Probably, they are personalized to you already. Now imagine if you build a knowledge graph from them for over a month. You will then **have a ideation device based on your interests and marketing profile**. Now, if you identify the gaps inside and generate interesting research questions based on them, you will **come up with new interesting ideas** that will be **relevant** (because they touch on the topics that matter to you), but **novel**, because they bridge them in new ways.\n\n\n## What is it useful for?\n\n- **Automate Gmail incoming message labeling** with the new Classifier n8n node — much more advanced than the default Gmail labeling rules.\n- Get **notified via Telegram** (or a messenger of your choice) about the most important messages and **be sure not to miss anything important**.\n- Keep the messages with a certain label saved into **knowledge graph** for brainstorming and ideation. \n- Every time a new message of this category comes in, it's added into the graph, changing its structure, a **new idea** is generated. So instead of looking at each specific offer, you now use them to generate **insights** for you.\n\n\n## How it works\n\n\n- Step 1: This template can is triggered automatically when a new Gmail message arrives.\n*Note: you need to connect your Gmail account here in this node*\n\n- Step 2: We use the new n8n AI Classifier Node to classify your email based on its content. You might need to update to n8n 1.94 version to make it work.\n*Note: we like to use Gemini AI for that classifier as it's the same company as Gmail, so should be safe with data*\n\n- Step 3: After classifying the message, we label the message with the appropriate label. \n*Note: you need to create the labels before in your Gmail account*\n\n- Step 4: For a certain category (e.g. \"Business\" you format the message and save it into your InfraNodus graph. \n*Note: specify your [InfraNodus API](https://infranodus.com/api-access) here and choose the name of the graph. It will use the [InfraNodus HTTP `graphAndEntries` endpoint](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/13605983537692-InfraNodus-API-Access-Points) and save your data to an InfraNodus graph. \nBy default, we save the text knowledge graph using the  `contextSettings` parameters (it will only build a text graph of the content), but you can take an alternative setting from this InfraNodus HTTP node's settings and create a social knowledge graph, that will also show email senders in the graph itself.*\n\n- Step 5 (optional): Generate an interesting insight question with the [`graphAndAdvice` endpoint]((https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/13605983537692-InfraNodus-API-Access-Points)) of InfraNodus. \n\n- Step 6 (optional): Then send this insight via Telegram to a chat.\n\n- Step 7 (optional): Link some important labels to the second Telegram notification node, so you receive important messages for specified labels.\n\n\n- Step 8 (optional): Send a Telegram notification \n\nWe use Telegram, because it takes only 30 seconds to set up a bot with an API (send `/newbot` to [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather), unlike Discord or Slack, which is long and cumbersome to set up. You can also attach a Gmail send node and generate an email instead. \n\n\n## How to use\n\nYou need an [InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) to use this workflow. \n\n- Create an [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) account or log in.\n- Get the API key at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access) and create a Bearer authorization key for the InfraNodus HTTP nodes.\n- Add this Authorization code in Steps 4 and 5 of the workflow.  \n- Come up with the name of the graph and change it in the HTTP InfraNodus nodes in the steps 4 and 5 and also in the Telegram node in Step 6 that sends a link to the graph.\n- For additional text processing / idea generation settings you can use in the HTTP InfraNodus nodes, see the [InfraNodus access points](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/13605983537692-InfraNodus-API-Access-Points) page. For example, in Step 4 you can change the text processing settings to build a social knowledge graph (settings are available in the Node's Notes section) and in Step 5 you can change the `requestMode` from `question` to `idea` to receive business ideas instead.\n- Authorize your Gmail account for Steps 2, 3, 7 and 8 Gmail nodes. The easiest way to set it up is to open a free Google Console API account and to create an OAuth access point for n8n. You can then reuse it with other Google services like Google Sheets, Drive, etc. So it's a useful thing to have in general.\n- Set up the Gemini AI API key using the instructions in the Step 2 Gemini AI classification node.\n- Set up the Telegram node bot for the Step 8. It takes only 30 seconds: just go to [@botfather](https://t.me/botfather) and type in `/newbot` and you'll have an API key ready. To get the conversation ID, follow the n8n / Telegram instructions in the node itself. \n- Once everything is ready, try to run the default automated workflow to test if everything works well. \n\n## Requirements\n\n- An [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) account and API key\n- An Google Cloud API OAuth client and key for Gmail access\n- A Gemini AI API key\n- A Telegram bot API key\n- n8n version 1.94 and higher (for Text Classification AI node to work)\n\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n\nCheck our **other n8n workflows** at [https://n8n.io/creators/infranodus/](https://n8n.io/creators/infranodus/) for useful content gap analysis, expert panel, and marketing, and research workflows that utilize GraphRAG for better AI generation.\n\nFinally, check out [https://infranodus.com](https://infranodus.com) to learn more about our **network analysis technology** used to build knowledge graphs from text.\n\nFor **support**, please, contact [https://support.noduslabs.com](https://support.noduslabs.com)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
