## How it works
This workflow runs on a daily schedule to analyze all Closed–Lost deals from your CRM and uncover the true reason behind each loss. It uses AI to classify the primary loss category, generate a confidence-backed explanation, and then create a realistic re-engagement strategy for every deal. All insights are consolidated into leadership-ready email and Slack summaries. Every analyzed deal and revival plan is logged for long-term tracking and audits.
