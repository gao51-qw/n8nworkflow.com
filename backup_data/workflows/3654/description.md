# Auto-create and publish AI social videos with Telegram, GPT-4 and Blotato

&gt; ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This workflow uses Community Nodes and must be run on a self-hosted instance of n8n.

### Who is this for?

This template is perfect for social media managers, content creators, AI enthusiasts, and automation pros who want to generate short-form videos (Reels) from a simple Telegram message, then publish them across multiple platforms—all without video editing or manual uploads.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Creating content is only half the job. The real bottleneck comes in:
- Rendering the video,
- Adding voice or music,
- Writing captions and titles,
- Publishing to multiple platforms.

This workflow automates all of that using AI. It saves hours every week and guarantees consistent output.

### What this workflow does

This end-to-end automation handles everything from AI video generation to social publishing:

1. **Starts with a Telegram message** (text or image prompt)
2. **Generates video** using Kling or Blotato, based on the input
3. **Creates music** with Piapi and merges it with the video
4. **Generates text overlays and captions** with GPT-4
5. **Builds a stylized video** using JSON2Video
6. **Logs results to Google Sheets**
7. **Sends final output back to Telegram**
8. **Auto-posts the video** to 9 platforms via Blotato (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter/X, Pinterest, Bluesky)

### Setup

1. Connect your **Telegram bot** to the trigger node.
2. Add your **OpenAI API key** for all GPT nodes.
3. Set up **Kling and Piapi** API access (for video and music generation).
4. Connect your **Cloudinary** account to upload images.
5. Link a **Google Sheet** with columns: Title, Caption, URL.
6. Set your **Blotato API key** and fill in the platform-specific account IDs.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs

- **Change prompt formatting** to control GPT responses and video tone.
- **Edit text styling** in JSON2Video to match your brand.
- **Add a Telegram approval step** before publishing, if needed.
- **Disable platforms** you don’t use by deleting their HTTP Request nodes.
- **Use a Google Sheet filter** to only process new rows or drafts.
