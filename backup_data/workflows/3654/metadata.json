The real bottleneck comes in:\n- Rendering the video,\n- Adding voice or music,\n- Writing captions and titles,\n- Publishing to multiple platforms.\n\nThis workflow automates all of that using AI. It saves hours every week and guarantees consistent output.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nThis end-to-end automation handles everything from AI video generation to social publishing:\n\n1. **Starts with a Telegram message** (text or image prompt)\n2. **Generates video** using Kling or Blotato, based on the input\n3. **Creates music** with Piapi and merges it with the video\n4. **Generates text overlays and captions** with GPT-4\n5. **Builds a stylized video** using JSON2Video\n6. **Logs results to Google Sheets**\n7. **Sends final output back to Telegram**\n8. **Auto-posts the video** to 9 platforms via Blotato (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, Twitter/X, Pinterest, Bluesky)\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Connect your **Telegram bot** to the trigger node.\n2. Add your **OpenAI API key** for all GPT nodes.\n3. Set up **Kling and Piapi** API access (for video and music generation).\n4. Connect your **Cloudinary** account to upload images.\n5. Link a **Google Sheet** with columns: Title, Caption, URL.\n6. Set your **Blotato API key** and fill in the platform-specific account IDs.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Change prompt formatting** to control GPT responses and video tone.\n- **Edit text styling** in JSON2Video to match your brand.\n- **Add a Telegram approval step** before publishing, if needed.\n- **Disable platforms** you don’t use by deleting their HTTP Request nodes.\n- **Use a Google Sheet filter** to only process new rows or drafts.\n\n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/Auto-create-and-publish-AI-social-videos-with-Telegram-GPT-4-and-Blotato-1dc3d6550fd980019cebd8ca461bd4ba?pvs=4)",
