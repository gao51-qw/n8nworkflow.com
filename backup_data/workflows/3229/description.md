## How it works
This workflow will activate and deactivate a selected other workflow on schedule.

&gt; ⚠️ Warning!
&gt; This approach **won't work for trial users** as it requires n8n API that is not available to trial users.
&gt; See [https://docs.n8n.io/api/](https://docs.n8n.io/api/) for details.

## Set up steps
1. Adjust activation/deactivation **schedule** per your needs. [Custom (cron) interval](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/#custom-cron-interval) is a recommended approach.
2. Set targeted **Workflow ID**. You will find it in the URL of the workflow you want to manage.

3. Set **n8n API credentials**:
- Create an API key: [how to](https://docs.n8n.io/api/authentication/)
- Create n8n credentials using the API key: [how to](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/add-edit-credentials/#create-a-credential)

This workflow uses **[n8n node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/)**.
