# TruePeopleSearch Scraper for Skip Tracers

Enrich any list of people with verified contact info using this workflow.  
This n8n automation scrapes **TruePeopleSearch** using **Zyte's extraction API** to safely bypass bot protection and extract detailed profiles. It’s built for **data brokers, skip tracers, and real estate professionals** who need clean contact data (phone, email, address) from names alone — even when the main profile is empty.  

If the original profile lacks a phone number, the workflow intelligently scrapes one of their listed relatives instead — giving you the **best possible chance of finding a valid number**.

## What this workflow does

- Pulls lead data (first name, last name, and custom search URL) from a **Google Sheet**
- Sends the TruePeopleSearch search URL to **Zyte’s Scraping API** to retrieve search results HTML
- Parses the first matching profile link from the results (by full name &gt; first name &gt; last name)
- Visits that profile page and extracts:
  - Full Name
  - Age / Date of Birth
  - Primary Phone Number
  - Other Phone Numbers
  - Email Addresses
  - Current Address
- If no phone numbers are found:
  - Detects a **relative's profile link**
  - Scrapes the relative’s profile for fallback contact data
- Writes all scraped information (or empty fields) back into the **same row** in Google Sheets

## You’ll need

- **n8n (self-hosted or cloud)**  
  To run and automate the workflow

- **Zyte Scraping API**  
  A [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/) account + API key to access their `/extract` endpoint  
  _(Use HTTP Basic Auth in the HTTP Request node)_

- **Google Sheets integration**  
  Your own lead sheet with headers like:
  - `row_number` (used to write back to the correct row)
  - `First Name`
  - `Last Name`
  - `SearchURL` (Search by Address)

- **Basic JavaScript familiarity (optional)**  
  To tweak the HTML parsing logic for profile structure changes

## Disclaimer  
- TruePeopleSearch may change its structure or block heavy scraping — always test at small scale first  
- This workflow is built to **simulate human behavior** via Zyte’s smart rendering — scraping is still subject to site limitations  
- Use ethically and within your local data usage laws
