  "description": "# TruePeopleSearch Scraper for Skip Tracers\n\nEnrich any list of people with verified contact info using this workflow.  \nThis n8n automation scrapes **TruePeopleSearch** using **Zyte's extraction API** to safely bypass bot protection and extract detailed profiles. It’s built for **data brokers, skip tracers, and real estate professionals** who need clean contact data (phone, email, address) from names alone — even when the main profile is empty.  \n\nIf the original profile lacks a phone number, the workflow intelligently scrapes one of their listed relatives instead — giving you the **best possible chance of finding a valid number**.\n\n---\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n- Pulls lead data (first name, last name, and custom search URL) from a **Google Sheet**\n- Sends the TruePeopleSearch search URL to **Zyte’s Scraping API** to retrieve search results HTML\n- Parses the first matching profile link from the results (by full name &gt; first name &gt; last name)\n- Visits that profile page and extracts:\n  - Full Name\n  - Age / Date of Birth\n  - Primary Phone Number\n  - Other Phone Numbers\n  - Email Addresses\n  - Current Address\n- If no phone numbers are found:\n  - Detects a **relative's profile link**\n  - Scrapes the relative’s profile for fallback contact data\n- Writes all scraped information (or empty fields) back into the **same row** in Google Sheets\n\n---\n\n## You’ll need\n\n- **n8n (self-hosted or cloud)**  \n  To run and automate the workflow\n\n- **Zyte Scraping API**  \n  A [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/) account + API key to access their `/extract` endpoint  \n  _(Use HTTP Basic Auth in the HTTP Request node)_\n\n- **Google Sheets integration**  \n  Your own lead sheet with headers like:\n  - `row_number` (used to write back to the correct row)\n  - `First Name`\n  - `Last Name`\n  - `SearchURL` (Search by Address)\n\n- **Basic JavaScript familiarity (optional)**  \n  To tweak the HTML parsing logic for profile structure changes\n\n---\n\n## Example Google Sheet  \nUse this Google Sheet as a template for your inputs and outputs:  \n👉 [TruePeopleSearch Lead Template (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkMMdoIYNTaA8tIvAXzjw9YeqkXfYD8qfkeACosuibo/edit#gid=1416164772)\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimer  \n- TruePeopleSearch may change its structure or block heavy scraping — always test at small scale first  \n- This workflow is built to **simulate human behavior** via Zyte’s smart rendering — scraping is still subject to site limitations  \n- Use ethically and within your local data usage laws\n\n---\n\n## Categories  \n`Data Enrichment` · `Scraping Automation` · `Lead Generation` · `Skip Tracing`\n\n---\n\n*Feel free to drop me an email if you need help with building a custom scraping automation for your business at* [*sajid@marketingbyprof.com*](mailto:sajid@marketingbyprof.com)\n",
