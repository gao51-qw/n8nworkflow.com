👥 Who's it for
This workflow is perfect for businesses or individuals who want to automate WhatsApp conversations 💬 with an intelligent AI chatbot that can handle text, voice notes 🎵, and images 🖼️. No advanced coding required!
🤖 What it does
It automatically receives WhatsApp messages through WasenderAPI, intelligently buffers consecutive messages to avoid fragmented responses, processes multimedia content (transcribing audio and analyzing images with AI), and responds naturally using GPT-4o mini with conversation memory. All while protecting your WhatsApp account from being banned.
⚙️ How it works

📱 Webhook Trigger – Receives new messages from WasenderAPI
🗃️ Redis Buffer System – Groups consecutive messages intelligently (7-second window)
🔀 Content Classifier – Routes messages by type (text, audio, or image)
🎵 Audio Processing – Decrypts and transcribes voice notes using OpenAI Whisper
🖼️ Image Analysis – Decrypts and analyzes images with GPT-4O Vision
🧠 AI Agent (GPT-4o mini) – Generates intelligent responses with 10-message memory
⏱️ Anti-Ban Wait – 6-second delay to simulate human typing
📤 Message Sender – Delivers response back to WhatsApp user
