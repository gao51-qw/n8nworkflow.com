  "description": "#  📰 Related News to Content Marketing Automation\n\n## Overview\n\nThis workflow automatically collects news from an RSS feed, identifies the most relevant article(s), and generates ready-to-use social media and blog content tailored for Medium, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\nIt’s ideal for:\n\t•\tMarketing teams who want a steady flow of fresh content.\n\t•\tSocial media managers looking to save time on research and writing.\n\t•\tStartups and creators who want consistent posting with minimal effort.\n\nInstead of manually scanning articles and drafting posts, this automation gives you AI-generated content with your preferred tone of voice — and even sends confirmation emails so you can review before posting.\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using this workflow, make sure you have:\n\t•\t✅ An n8n account (self-hosted or cloud).\n\t•\t✅ An OpenAI API key for content generation.\n\t•\t✅ An RSS feed URL for your industry or niche.\n\t•\t✅ A Gmail account (or another configured email service) to receive content confirmation messages.\n\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. Import the Workflow\n\nDownload and import this workflow into your n8n instance.\n\n2. Configure the RSS Feed\n\t•\tOpen the RSS Read node.\n\t•\tReplace the sample URL with your preferred news source(s).\n\n3. Connect OpenAI\n\t•\tOpen the OpenAI Chat Model node.\n\t•\tAdd your OpenAI API Key in the credentials.\n\t•\t(Optional) Adjust the prompts in the “Tone of Voice Writer” or “Instagram & LinkedIn Writer” nodes to match your brand’s style.\n\n4. Set Up Gmail\n\t•\tOpen the Send Content Confirmation nodes.\n\t•\tConnect your Gmail (or another email service).\n\t•\tAdd the email address where you want to receive content drafts.\n\n5. Run & Automate\n\t•\tTrigger the workflow manually with Execute Workflow to test.\n\t•\tOnce tested, enable the Schedule Trigger node to run it automatically (e.g., daily).\n\n\n## Customization Options\n\t•\t🔄 Add more platforms: extend the workflow for Twitter, Facebook, or Slack.\n\t•\t✏️ Adjust tone & length: update prompts in AI nodes (casual, professional, humorous, etc.).\n\t•\t✅ Human-in-the-loop: add approval steps before publishing directly.\n\t•\t🌍 Change news sources: swap RSS feeds for different industries or niches.\n\n\n## Example Output\n\nLinkedIn Draft:\n“The future of marketing is AI-driven. 🚀 A new study shows that brands leveraging automation see 3x faster content turnaround.

What do you think — game-changer or hype? 🤔 #AI #Marketing”\n\n\n## Limitations\n\t•\tAI may produce errors → Always review generated content before posting.\n\t•\tGmail integration only sends drafts for confirmation — direct posting is not included.\n\t•\tRSS feeds vary in quality — results depend on your chosen source.\n\n\n## How It Works (Workflow Overview)\n\t1.\tCollecting the news → Fetch articles via RSS feed.\n\t2.\tBest Article Finder → Selects the most relevant item.\n\t3.\tAI Writing → Generates content tailored for Medium, LinkedIn, and Instagram.\n\t4.\tEmail Confirmation → Sends drafts to your inbox for review",
