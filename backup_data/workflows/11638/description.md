## What This Workflow Does

1. **Fetches videos from a Google Drive folder**  
   You provide a folder ID and the workflow lists all files, filtering to keep only `.mp4`.

2. **Builds a simple publishing calendar**  
   You configure:
   - Start date
   - Cadence (daily, 5/week, 3/week)
   - Timezone
   - One **Publish Hour** shared across all selected platforms

   The workflow creates:
   - **Schedule Date**
   - **Schedule DateTime** for each video

3. **Analyzes each video with AI**  
   Gemini performs a structured analysis of the video to understand:
   - What happens in the content
   - Key topics
   - Tone
   - Audience intent

4. **Generates platform-specific social copy**  
   For each video, the AI creates unique text for:
   - **TikTok**
   - **Instagram Reels**
   - **YouTube Shorts**

   The prompts are **language-aware**:
   - If the video is in **English**, the titles/descriptions are generated in English.
   - If the video is in **Spanish**, they are generated in Spanish.

5. **Saves everything to Google Sheets as drafts**  
   Each video becomes one row with:
   - Titles, descriptions, hashtags/tags
   - A single shared Schedule DateTime
   - **Status = draft**

6. **Auto-publishes approved rows (Flow 2)**  
   Every hour:
   - Loads the sheet
   - Filters rows where **Status = approved**
   - Downloads the Drive file
   - Schedules the video to the selected platforms
   - Updates **Status = scheduled**

## Sheet Structure

The tracking sheet is designed to be a clean approval queue.  
Recommended columns:

## How Approval Works

- New rows start as **draft**.
- You revise any copy directly in Sheets.
- When ready, change **Status** to **approved**.
- Flow 2 schedules the video and updates the row.
