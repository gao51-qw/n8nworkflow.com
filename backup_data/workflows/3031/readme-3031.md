> ![callforgecompressed.png](fileId:1003)

## Workflow Description

### Who is this for?
This workflow is designed for **sales and revenue teams** using **Gong and Salesforce** to track and analyze sales calls. It helps automate the extraction, filtering, and preprocessing of Gong call data for further AI analysis.

### What problem is this solving?
Sales teams often generate large amounts of call data, but not all calls are relevant for deeper analysis. This workflow **filters calls** based on predefined criteria, extracts relevant metadata, and **formats the data** before passing it to an AI processing pipeline.

### What this workflow does
- **Triggers on new Gong calls synced to Salesforce** every hour.
- **Filters calls based on opportunity stage** (Discovery or Meeting Booked).
- **Retrieves Gong call details** via API.
- **Formats call data into a structured JSON object** for AI processing.
- **Passes the structured data to a Gong Call Preprocessor workflow** for further insights.

### Setup
1. Ensure that you have connected **Salesforce** and **Gong** APIs with valid credentials.
2. Modify the Salesforce query in `Get all custom Salesforce Gong Objects` to match your organization’s requirements.
3. Set the schedule trigger interval in the `Run Hourly` node if needed.
4. Connect this workflow to an AI processing workflow to analyze call transcripts.

### How to customize

- **Modify data formatting**: Add or remove fields in the `Format call into correct JSON Object` node to customize the output.
- **Adjust trigger frequency**: Change the `Run Hourly` node to run at a different interval if required.
