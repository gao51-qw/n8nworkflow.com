In Session, we have a timestamp fields which is created at the **Input node.** The usage of this is combined to use with the session id to create a unique session, since some media, such as Telegram, do not have a unique session along with the chat.\n2. You can use any **AI Model** for the **AI Agent** node\n3. Learn we use the prompt for the **Load/Save User Memory** on demand.\n4. Include is our prompt for the taxi service.
