# Convert news headlines to audio newsletters with Claude, GPT-4o & OpenAI TTS

> # Generate daily audio newsletters from news headlines with AI

## Who's it for

Perfect for **content creators, podcasters, news enthusiasts, and busy professionals** who want to create automated audio news content or stay informed through personalized audio briefings. Ideal for social media managers, newsletter creators, and anyone building audio-first content experiences.

## How it works

This workflow creates a fully automated news-to-audio pipeline:

1. **Schedule trigger** fetches the latest news headlines from NewsAPI daily
2. **AI processing** rewrites each article into newsletter-style content using Claude
3. **Content aggregation** combines all processed articles into a cohesive newsletter
4. **Script generation** transforms the newsletter into a 2-minute audio-ready script
5. **Text-to-speech** converts the script into high-quality audio using OpenAI's voice models
6. **Email delivery** sends the audio newsletter as an attachment to subscribers

The workflow runs automatically on your chosen schedule, delivering fresh audio content without any manual intervention.
