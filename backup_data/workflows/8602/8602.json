    "description": "This n8n template demonstrates how to automatically **create** **tasks** (or in general, records) in Baserow based on template or blueprint tables. The first blueprint table is the **master table** that holds the general information about the template. For example: a standard procedure to handle incidents. The second table is the **details table** that holds multiple records for the template. Each record in that table is a specific task that needs to be assigned to someone with a certain deadline. \n\nThis makes it easy to streamline task creation for recurring processes. Use cases are many:\n- Project management (generate tasks for employees based on a project template)\n- HR & onboarding (generate tasks for employee onboarding based on a template)\n- Operations (create checklists for maintenance, audits, or recurring procedures)\n\n## Good to know\n- The Baserow template for handling [Standard Operating Procedures](https://baserow.io/templates/standard-operating-procedures) works perfect as a base schema to try out this workflow.\n- Authentication is done through a database token. Check the [documentation](https://baserow.io/user-docs/personal-api-tokens) on how to create such a token.\n- Tasks are inserted using the HTTP request node instead of a dedicated Baserow node. This is to support batch import instead of importing records one by one.\n\n## Requirements\n- Baserow account (cloud or self-hosted)\n- A Baserow database with at least the following tables:\n    - `Assignee` / employee table. This is required to be able to assign someone to a task.\n    - `Master` table with procedure or template information. This is required to be able to select a certain template\n    - `Details` table with all the steps associated with a procedure or template. This is required to convert each step into a specific task.\n        - A step must have a field `Days to complete` with the number of days to complete the step. This field will be used to calculate the deadline.\n    - `Tasks` table that contains the actual tasks with an assignee and deadline.\n\n## How it works\n- **Trigger task creation (webhook)**\n    - The automation starts when the webhook is triggered through a POST request.\n    - It should contain an assignee, template, date and note in the body of the request.\n    - It will send a succes or failure response once all steps are completed.\n- **Configure settings and ids**\n    - Stores the ids of the involved Baserow database and tables, together with the API credentials and the data from the webhook.\n- **Get all template steps**\n    - Gets all the steps from the template `Details` table that are associated with the id of the `Master` template table.\n    - For example: the master template can have a record about handling customer complaints. The details table contains all the steps to handle this procedure.\n- **Calculate deadlines for each step**\n    - Prepares the input of the tasks by using the same property names as the field of the `Tasks` table. Adjust this names, add or remove fields if this is required for your database structure.\n    - The deadline of each step is calculated by adding the number of days a step can take based on the deadline of the first step. This is done through a field `Days to complete` in the template `Details` table.\n        - For example. If the `schedule_date` property in the webhook is set to 2025-10-01 and the `Days to complete` for the step is 3, then the deadline will be 2025-10-04\n- **Avoid scheduling during the weekend**\n    - It might happen that the calculated deadline is on a Saturday or Sunday. This Code node moves those dates to the first Monday to avoid scheduling during the weekend.\n- **Aggregate tasks for insert**\n    - Aggregates the data from the previous nodes as an array in a property named `items`. This matches perfect with the Baserow API to insert new records in batch.\n- **Generate tasks in batch**\n    - Calls the API endpoint `/api/database/rows/table/{table_id}/batch/` to insert multiple records at once in the tasks table. Check the [Baserow API documentation](https://api.baserow.io/api/redoc/#tag/Database-table-rows/operation/batch_create_database_table_rows) for further details.\n- **Success / Error response**\n    - Sends a simple text response to indicate the success or failure of the record creation. This is to offer feedback when triggering the automation from a Baserow application, but can be replaced with a JSON response.\n\n## How to use\n- Call the `Trigger task creation` node with the required parameters through a POST request. This can be done from any web application. For example: the application builder in Baserow supports an action to send an HTTP request. The Procedure details page in the [Standard Operating Procedures](https://baserow.io/templates/standard-operating-procedures) template demonstrates this action.\n    - The following information is required in the body of the request. This information is required to create the actual tasks.\n        \n        ```json\n        {\n            \"assignee_id\": integer refering to the id of the assignee in the database,\n            \"template_id\": integer refering to the id of the template or procedure in the master table,\n            \"schedule_date\": the date the tasks need to start scheduling,\n            \"note\": text with an optional note about the tasks\n        }\n        ```\n        \n- Set the corresponding ids in the `Configure settings and ids` node.\n- Check the names of the properties in the `Calculate deadlines for each step` node. Make sure the names of those properties match the field names of your `Tasks` table.\n- You can replace the text message in the `Success response` and `Failure response` with a more structured format if this is necessary in your application.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n- Add support for public holidays (e.g., using an external calendar API).\n- Modify the task assignment logic (e.g., pre-assign tasks in the details table).\n- Combine with notifications (email, Slack, etc.) to alert employees when new tasks are generated.",

This field will be used to calculate the deadline.\n    - `Tasks` table that contains the actual tasks with an assignee and deadline.\n\n## How it works\n- **Trigger task creation (webhook)**\n    - The automation starts when the webhook is triggered through a POST request.\n    - It should contain an assignee, template, date and note in the body of the request.\n    - It will send a succes or failure response once all steps are completed.\n- **Configure settings and ids**\n    - Stores the ids of the involved Baserow database and tables, together with the API credentials and the data from the webhook.\n- **Get all template steps**\n    - Gets all the steps from the template `Details` table that are associated with the id of the `Master` template table.\n    - For example: the master template can have a record about handling customer complaints. The details table contains all the steps to handle this procedure.\n- **Calculate deadlines for each step**\n    - Prepares the input of the tasks by using the same property names as the field of the `Tasks` table. Adjust this names, add or remove fields if this is required for your database structure.\n    - The deadline of each step is calculated by adding the number of days a step can take based on the deadline of the first step. This is done through a field `Days to complete` in the template `Details` table.\n        - For example. If the `schedule_date` property in the webhook is set to 2025-10-01 and the `Days to complete` for the step is 3, then the deadline will be 2025-10-04\n- **Avoid scheduling during the weekend**\n    - It might happen that the calculated deadline is on a Saturday or Sunday. This Code node moves those dates to the first Monday to avoid scheduling during the weekend.\n- **Aggregate tasks for insert**\n    - Aggregates the data from the previous nodes as an array in a property named `items`. This matches perfect with the Baserow API to insert new records in batch.\n- **Generate tasks in batch**\n    - Calls the API endpoint `/api/database/rows/table/{table_id}/batch/` to insert multiple records at once in the tasks table. Check the [Baserow API documentation](https://api.baserow.io/api/redoc/#tag/Database-table-rows/operation/batch_create_database_table_rows) for further details.\n- **Success / Error response**\n    - Sends a simple text response to indicate the success or failure of the record creation. This is to offer feedback when triggering the automation from a Baserow application, but can be replaced with a JSON response.\n\n## How to use\n- Call the `Trigger task creation` node with the required parameters through a POST request. This can be done from any web application. For example: the application builder in Baserow supports an action to send an HTTP request. The Procedure details page in the [Standard Operating Procedures](https://baserow.io/templates/standard-operating-procedures) template demonstrates this action.\n    - The following information is required in the body of the request. This information is required to create the actual tasks.\n        \n        ```json\n        {\n            \"assignee_id\": integer refering to the id of the assignee in the database,\n            \"template_id\": integer refering to the id of the template or procedure in the master table,\n            \"schedule_date\": the date the tasks need to start scheduling,\n            \"note\": text with an optional note about the tasks\n        }\n        ```\n        \n- Set the corresponding ids in the `Configure settings and ids` node.\n- Check the names of the properties in the `Calculate deadlines for each step` node. Make sure the names of those properties match the field names of your `Tasks` table.\n- You can replace the text message in the `Success response` and `Failure response` with a more structured format if this is necessary in your application.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n- Add support for public holidays (e.g., using an external calendar API).\n- Modify the task assignment logic (e.g., pre-assign tasks in the details table).\n- Combine with notifications (email, Slack, etc.) to alert employees when new tasks are generated."
