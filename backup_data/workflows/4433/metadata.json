  "description": "## Motivation\n\nAre you a small YT channel looking to grow to 1000 subs ?\nThis workflow has helped me grow to 80 subs via Reddit Marketing. \nCheck out the [YT Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ET4zT0DE4uw).\n\n## What it is\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of promoting your YouTube videos on Reddit. It identifies relevant Reddit posts, generates humanized comments tailored to your video content, and delivers a weekly digest of opportunities directly to your inbox.\n\n## How It Works\n\nA user submits their YouTube video URL and email through a form.\n\nThe workflow analyzes the YouTube video's title, description, and tags to extract relevant keywords and create a custom AI classification prompt.\n\nIt searches Reddit for posts containing those keywords and filters them based on engagement metrics\n\n1. upvotes &gt; 15\n2. non-empty text content\n3. posted within the last 14 days\n4. upvote ratio &gt; 0.95\n\nAn AI agent (using OpenRouter&apos;s GPT-4.1-mini) classifies each filtered Reddit post to determine its relevance to your YouTube video.\n\nFor relevant posts, another AI agent (using OpenRouter&apos;s Gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) generates a humanized, authentic comment designed to subtly reference your video and add value to the Reddit discussion.\n\nRelevant posts and their proposed comments are stored in Google Sheets.\n\nA professional HTML email digest is generated, summarizing the marketing opportunities.\n\nThe email is sent to the user's provided email address.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo run this workflow, you need to set up credentials in n8n for:\n\n- YouTube: Uses OAuth 2.0. Connect by authenticating your YouTube account.\n- Reddit: Uses OAuth 2.0. Requires creating an app on Reddit to get a Client ID & Secret. ([YT Tutorial](https://youtu.be/zlGXtW4LAK8))\n- OpenRouter: Generate API key from your OpenRouter account. ([YT Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Cq5Y3zpEhlc))\n- Google Sheets: Recommend OAuth2 - just connect by authenticating.\n- Gmail: Recommend OAuth 2.0. like Google Sheets\n\n## n8n account setup\n\nIf you do not have a n8n account, follow the [YT Tutorial](https://youtu.be/E2yQelHPUdU) to get started.",
