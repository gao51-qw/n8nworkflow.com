### This template allows you to automatically process scanned invoices from Google Drive, extract key information using AI, and organize the data in Google Sheets with email notifications.

### Overview
This comprehensive workflow automates the entire invoice processing pipeline by monitoring a Google Drive folder for new invoice uploads, intelligently processing both PDF and image formats, extracting structured data using AI-powered information extraction, and automatically organizing the results in a Google Sheet while sending email notifications. The system handles various file formats and includes smart fallback mechanisms for challenging documents like CamScanner PDFs.

### How it Works

1. **File Monitoring**: The workflow continuously monitors a specified Google Drive folder for new invoice files using a trigger that checks every minute for newly created files.

2. **File Processing**: When new files are detected, the system downloads them and determines the file type (PDF or image) using a smart switch mechanism.

3. **Text Extraction**: 
   - For PDFs: Attempts direct text extraction first
   - For Images: Uses OCR.Space API for optical character recognition
   - For problematic PDFs (like CamScanner): Falls back to OCR processing

4. **AI Information Extraction**: Processes the extracted text through OpenAI's language model to identify and extract key invoice information including:
   - Company name
   - Total amount
   - Currency
   - Invoice date
   - Invoice number

5. **Data Storage**: Automatically appends the extracted information to a Google Sheet with links back to the original scanned documents.

6. **Notification**: Sends formatted email notifications via Mailgun when new invoices are processed, including an HTML table summary.

### How to Use

1. **Setup Google Drive**: Create a dedicated folder in Google Drive for invoice uploads and note the folder ID.

2. **Configure Credentials**: Set up the following credential connections in n8n:
   - Google Drive OAuth2 API
   - Google Sheets OAuth2 API  
   - OpenAI API
   - OCR.Space API
   - Mailgun API

3. **Update Configuration**: 
   - Replace the Google Drive folder ID with your target folder
   - Replace the Google Sheets document ID with your destination spreadsheet
   - Update email addresses in the Mailgun node

4. **Test the Workflow**: Use the manual trigger to process existing invoices in your folder for initial testing.

5. **Activate**: Enable the workflow to start automatic monitoring of new invoice uploads.

## Requirements

**External APIs:**
- **OpenAI API** - For AI-powered information extraction from invoice text
- **OCR.Space API** - For optical character recognition of image-based invoices
- **Mailgun API** - For sending email notifications

**Google Services:**
- **Google Drive API** - For monitoring folders and downloading files
- **Google Sheets API** - For storing extracted invoice data

**Setup Prerequisites:**
- Google Drive folder dedicated to invoice uploads
- Google Sheet with appropriate column headers (date, company name, total, currency, invoice number, scan link, etc.)
- Email domain configured with Mailgun (or alternative email service)
- OCR.Space account for image processing capabilities: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI

**Recommended Settings:**
- Set the Google Drive trigger to check for new files every minute
- Ensure sufficient API rate limits for your expected invoice volume
- Configure proper error handling for failed OCR or AI extraction attempts
