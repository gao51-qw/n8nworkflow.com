### How it Works

This n8n workflow enables users to create professional documents using Anthropic's Claude AI and automatically save them to Google Drive. The process works as follows:

1. **Form Trigger**: The workflow starts with a web form where users submit a prompt and select their desired file type (PPTX, PDF, DOCX, or XLSX).

2. **Document Type Routing**: A switch node routes the request based on the selected file type to the appropriate document creation node.

3. **AI Document Generation**: Each document type has a dedicated HTTP Request node that calls Anthropic's Messages API with:
   - Specific system prompts tailored for each document type (PowerPoint, PDF, Word, or Excel)
   - The user's input prompt
   - Appropriate Anthropic skills (pptx, pdf, docx, xlsx) for specialized document creation
   - Code execution capabilities for complex formatting

4. **File ID Extraction**: Custom JavaScript code nodes extract the generated file ID from Anthropic's response using recursive search algorithms to handle nested response structures.

5. **File Download**: HTTP Request nodes download the actual file content from Anthropic's Files API using the extracted file ID.

6. **Cloud Storage**: Finally, the downloaded files are automatically uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder, organized and ready for use.

   - Modify the form dropdown to include custom skill options if needed

4. **Form Configuration**:
   - The form is pre-configured with prompt field and file type selection
   - No additional setup required for basic functionality

5. **Execution**:
   - Activate the workflow
   - Access the form trigger URL
   - Submit prompts and select desired output formats
   - Generated files will automatically appear in the specified Google Drive folder
