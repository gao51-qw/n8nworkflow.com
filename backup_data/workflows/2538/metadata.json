  "description": "This workflow demonstrates how to use the `workflowStaticData()` function to set any type of variable that will persist within workflow executions. \n\n[https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/)\n\nThis can be useful for example when working with access tokens that expire after a certain time period. Using `staticData` we can keep a record of that access token and the expiry time and build our workflow logic around it. \n\n\n## Important\n\nStatic Data only persists across **_production_** executions, i.e. triggered by Webhooks or Schedule Triggers (not manual executions!)\nFor this the workflow will have to be activated. \n\n## Setup\n\n- configure HTTP Request node to fetch access token from your API (optional)\n- activate workflow\n- test the workflow with the webhook production link\n- you can check the population of the static data in the single executions\n\n### Feedback\n\nIf you found this useful or want to report some missing information - I'd be happy to hear from you at [ria@n8n.io](mailto:ria@n8n.io)\n\n\n",
