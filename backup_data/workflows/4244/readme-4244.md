## How it works?
Easy explanation:

The First Schedule Trigger is used to position the right and wise time, and organize the get data to the next Node. It's like the right execution must be at the right time.

After that an HTTP Request will be received from Gecko Coin to work together with the Function, in this case I chose manual coding because it is detailed and specific.

After that, the Function will carry out its task, namely changing the raw data into data that is ready to be read by humans.

Then after everything is sent and received by Gmail, it produces results in the form of ready-to-read data.

You can immediately see the data thoroughly, because the data has been processed. If you want to process it again, just direct the AI ​​system to process it again.

And all duties and responsibilities have been completed

Very practical and easy, plus its automatic nature. I'm sure you can understand it wisely.

## Set up instructions
Complete what is in the nodes as stated in the notes column.

First, you have to connect or create a Gmail “Credentials Account”. Because all nodes have been setup neatly and cleanly.

Second, next in Gmail, write your email address to receive the data. 

Here, just follow the module instructions that n8n has provided, making it very easy. This will honor you of course.
