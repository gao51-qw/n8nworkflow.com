  "description": "## Notion Weekly Journal AI Summary\nThis workflow will run on a weekly schedule and retrieve your Notion Daily Journal pages for the past week and aggregate them into a ChatGPT generated concise summary. It will save that weekly summary back to your Notion as a new Note in addition to posting to a personal Discord channel.\n\nAdditionally it will also retrieve all of the Tasks you've completed in the past week and provide a quick total with a congratulatory message to a Discord channel as well.\n\n### Requirements/Setup:\n- You need Notion setup w/ a Notes database\n  - If you want the Discord messages, setup a Discord webhook for your channel as well, or simply delete the Discord nodes.\n- One of the properties for the Notes db should be `Type` with a value of `Journal`\n- The contents of your daily Journal pages can be whatever you want\n  - I've found what works best for me is the format of \"What was a highlight of the day?\", \"What was a low point of the day?\", and \"What decisions did I delegate, delay, or dodge?\"\n- You should also create an additional `Type` for your Weekly summary page that gets created - in this case I used simply `Weekly`\n- Automate this to run weekly on your day of choice. I tend to only journal on weekdays so I've set mine up to run every Friday retrieving the past week's Journal entries.\n\n\n### Options:\n- You don't have to use Discord, feel free to swap out with Slack or remove altogether.\n- You also don't need to use the Tasks summary bottom half, simply remove that if you don't want it or need it.\n- You can easily reuse this workflow to aggregate your Weekly Summary notes (that this workflow auto generates/saves) to generate a Quarterly or even Yearly summary!\n\n",
