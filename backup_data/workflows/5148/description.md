## How it works
Build a chatbot that answers based on documents you provide it (Retrieval Augmented Generation). You can upload as many PDF files as you want to the Qdrant database. The chatbot will use its retrieval tool to fetch the chunks and use them to answer questions.

## Installation
1. Install n8n + Ollama + Qdrant using the [Self-hosted AI starter kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit)
2. Make sure to install Llama 3.2 and mxbai-embed-large as embeddings model.

## How to use it
1. First run the "Data Ingestion" part and upload as many PDF files as you want
2. Run the Chatbot and start asking questions about the documents you uploaded
