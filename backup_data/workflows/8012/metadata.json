  "description": "## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete and automated solution for deep-dive lead research and hyper-personalized email generation. \n\nIt transforms a basic list of LinkedIn profiles into a campaign-ready database by first enriching contacts with detailed career data and then using AI to craft unique, context-aware emails based on each individual's professional journey.\n\n## Who's this workflow for?\n- Sales Development Representatives (SDRs)\n- Account Executives (AEs)\n- B2B Marketers & Growth Hackers\n- Recruiters & Talent Acquisition Specialists\n- Startup Founders\n\n## How it works\n**1. Scheduled Data Fetch:** The workflow runs automatically on a schedule, fetching a list of leads (containing LinkedIn URLs) from a Google Sheet.\n\n**2. Enrich Profiles with Apify:** For each lead that hasn't been processed, it uses an Apify actor to scrape their LinkedIn profile, extracting key information like their \"About\" section and detailed work experience.\n\n**3. Update Central Database:** The scraped career history is saved back into a \"Profile Data\" column in the original Google Sheet, creating a rich, centralized lead profile.\n\n**4. AI Email Personalization:** The workflow sends the complete, enriched profile data to a Google Gemini AI model via LangChain, using a sophisticated prompt that instructs it to act as an expert B2B copywriter.\n\n**5. Craft a Unique Hook**: The AI analyzes the lead's entire career journey to find unique \"nuggets\"—like long tenure, specific achievements, or unusual career paths—and uses them to write a compelling opening line.\n\n**6. Save the Final Email Draft:** The AI-generated subject line and personalized email body are saved back into the Google Sheet, leaving you with a ready-to-send, hyper-personalized outreach campaign.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Google Sheets Setup:**\n- Connect your Google Sheets account to n8n.\n- In all three Google Sheets nodes, select your credentials and update the Document ID and Sheet Name to match your lead list.\n- Populate your sheet with initial lead data, including at least their LinkedIn URL.\n\n**2. Apify Connection:**\n- Connect your Apify account in the Runs Profile Extraction Actor node.\n\n**3. Google Gemini AI Connection:**\n- Connect your Google Gemini (PaLM) API account in the Google Gemini Chat Model node.\n\n**4. Configure the Schedule:**\n- In the Schedule Trigger node, set the interval for how often you want the workflow to run and process new leads.\n\n**5. Activate Workflow:**\n- Save the workflow and toggle the \"Active\" switch to ON. Your automated research and personalization engine is now active.\n\n## Key Requirements to Use This Template\n- n8n Instance: An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).\n- Google Account & Sheet: A pre-made Google Sheet with columns for First Name, Last Name, LinkedIn, Profile Data, Subject, and Email Body.\n- Apify Account: An active Apify account with a plan that supports the LinkedIn Profile Scraper actor.\n- Google Gemini AI Account: A Google Cloud account with the Vertex AI API (for Gemini models) enabled and an associated API Key.\n\n## Connect with us\n- Website: https://www.intuz.com/services\n- Email: getstarted@intuz.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuz\n- Get Started: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/intuz\n\n## For Custom Worflow Automation\nClick here- [Get Started](https://www.intuz.com/get-started)\n\n\n\n",
