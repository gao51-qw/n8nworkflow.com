  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis is an **example of using sub-workflow nodes** and a proof of concept showing that it’s possible to **solve and explain recursive problems with n8n**.\n\n### Towers of Hanoi - Task\nMove a stack of n disks from rod A to rod C, using rod B as auxiliary. Only one disk can be moved at a time, and no disk may be placed on a smaller disk.\n\n### Example\n```\nn=4\n     |          |          |\n     =          |          |\n    ===         |          |\n   =====        |          |\n  =======       |          |\n ---------  ---------  ---------\n     A          B          C\n```\n### Algorithm\n```\nprocedure Hanoi(n, X, Y, Z):\n  if n == 1:\n    move disk from X to Z\n  else:\n    Hanoi(n-1, X, Z, Y)\n    move disk from X to Z\n    Hanoi(n-1, Y, X, Z)\n```\n\n### Notes\n- This is a learning example. In a real scenario, you would probably use an iterative approach with only a single code node.\n- When experimenting with recursion, make sure to define a termination condition first. Also, be aware of the \"Restart workspace\" link in the [n8n Dashboard](https://app.n8n.cloud/manage).\n- Learn more about [Recursion on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Recursion_(computer_science)&oldid=1301600240#Towers_of_Hanoi).\n\n## Set up steps\n- Optional: Set \"*numberOfDiscs*\" in node \"*Set number of discs*\"\n- Execute workflow",
