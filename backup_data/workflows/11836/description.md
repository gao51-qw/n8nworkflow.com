## This n8n template automates email labeling using AI-enhanced classification and intelligent routing

Gmail users report spending significant time manually sorting email, so this tool helps alleviate that burden.

## How it works
- Gmail Trigger monitors unread emails every 2 minutes
- Once an email arrives, the content is extracted with HTML cleaning
- AI Agent (the node is set for Chat GPT-4) is used for classification & entity extraction
- A Structured Output Parser parses the email to JSON
- A 9-way category routing system categorizes the email (Inquiry, Support, Newsletter, Marketing, Personal, Urgent, Spam, Invoice, Meeting)
- Gmail auto-labeling is used for each category
- Google Sheets is used for logging (the main log that includes all emails and  an error log which are emails that cannot be classified)
- Slack alerts are generated for high-priority/urgent emails
- Error handling is done with separate error logging in Google Sheets

## How to use
- Set up credentials for Google Gmail, LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), Google Sheets, and Slack
- Modify the categories as needed per user preference

## Requirements
- Gmail 
- Any LLM like ChatGPT or Google Gemini
- Google Drive with Google Sheets is optional for logging and error handling
- Slack is optional for high-priority messages
