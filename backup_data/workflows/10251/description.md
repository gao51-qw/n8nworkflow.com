## How It Works

### Triggers

The workflow runs:
- Automatically (via **Schedule Trigger**) — e.g., once daily  
- Manually (via **Manual Trigger**) — for testing or on-demand analysis

### Data Collection Process

1. **Keyword Loading:**  
   Reads all keywords from the Data Table **“Brand Monitoring Words”**

2. **Social Media Search:**  
   For each keyword, the workflow calls the **AnySite API** endpoints:  
   - `api/reddit/search/posts`  
   - `api/linkedin/search/posts`  
   - `api/twitter/search/posts` (X)  
   - `api/instagram/search/posts`

3. **Deduplication:**  
   Before saving, checks if a post already exists in the **“Brand Monitoring Posts”** table.

4. **Data Storage:**  
   Inserts new posts into the Data Table with fields like `type`, `title`, `url`, `vote_count`, `comment_count`, etc.

5. **Comments Enrichment:**  
   For Reddit and LinkedIn, retrieves and formats comments into JSON strings, then updates the record.

6. **AI Analysis & Report Generation:**  
   The **AI Agent** (OpenAI GPT model) aggregates posts, analyzes sentiment, engagement, risks, and generates a structured **HTML email report**.

7. **Email Sending:**  
   Sends the final report via Gmail using your connected account.
