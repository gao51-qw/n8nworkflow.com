  "description": "### This n8n template watches an outlook shared inbox for support messages and creates an equivalent issue item in JIRA.\n\n### How it works\n* A scheduled trigger fetches recent Outlook messages from an shared inbox which collects support requests.\n* These support requests are filtered to ensure they are only processed once and their HTML body is converted to markdown for easier parsing.\n* Each support request is then triaged via an AI Agent which adds appropriate labels, assesses priority and summarises a title and description of the original request.\n* Finally, the AI generated values are used to create an issue in JIRA to be actioned.\n\n### How to use\n* Ensure the messages fetched are solely support requests otherwise you'll need to classify messages before processing them.\n* Specify the labels and priorities to use in the system prompt of the AI agent.\n\n### Requirements\n* Outlook for incoming support\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* JIRA for issue management\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Consider automating more steps after the issue is created such as attempting issue resolution or capacity planning.\n",
