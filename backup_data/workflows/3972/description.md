## 🌍 AI WhatsApp Translator + Voice Transcriber with HubSpot Integration

#### Hello! I'm Amanda ❤️, a passionate automation creator and AI enthusiast.  
With over 2 years of experience in n8n and Make.com, I design robust, intelligent agents  
that make your operations smarter and smoother.

This translator + transcriber assistant is perfect for multilingual communication via WhatsApp.  
It automatically captures voice or text messages, identifies the customer's region and language,  
transcribes audio using OpenAI Whisper, and generates friendly, culturally adapted translations  
with GPT-4 or GPT-4o. All messages and contacts are saved in your HubSpot CRM—so no lead gets lost.
