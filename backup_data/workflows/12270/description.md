This n8n workflow is an end-to-end AI-powered video generation pipeline that takes a dataset of sci-fi book, generates reviews with GenAI, dynamically injects assets into After Effects via Nexrender, and automatically produces fully rendered videos — ready for publishing.

It demonstrates:
    •    AI content generation inside render jobs
    •    Dynamic After Effects templating
    •    Adaptive composition logic
    •    Fully automated creative production at scale

Built as a demo for the Nexrender n8n integration, it shows how to turn raw ideas into finished video content with zero manual editing.

Requirements:
1. Nexrender Trial - https://www.nexrender.com/get-trial,
2. N8N - https://n8n.io/,
3. Fal.ai - https://fal.ai/,
4. After Effects Project file - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmDcBMM34IFQ2Cv28pzumDmk2OwW2_9q/view?usp=share_link,
5. Nexrender Integration - https://n8n.io/integrations/nexrender/

How It Works:
• Imports a sci-fi books dataset into n8n
• Uses GenAI (ChatGPT) to generate book reviews and narrative content
• Cleans and structures the AI output for video rendering
• Dynamically injects text and assets into an After Effects template via n8n Nexrender Integration
• Submits the job to Nexrender for rendering
• Generates AI-powered visuals inside the render job
• Automatically adjusts composition length based on each review
• Outputs a fully produced video — no manual editing required
