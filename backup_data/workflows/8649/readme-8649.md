## Who's it for

This template is designed for **content marketers, social media managers, small business owners, marketing agencies, and content creators** who need to produce consistent, high-quality content across multiple platforms. It's perfect for businesses that want to streamline their content creation process, maintain a consistent brand voice, and leverage AI to create platform-specific content that resonates with their target audience.

## How it works / What it does

This workflow creates an **automated content creation system** that transforms form submissions into multi-platform content. The system:

1. **Receives form submissions** with content subject and target audience through n8n form trigger
2. **Extracts search parameters** from form data to prepare for web research
3. **Searches the web** using Tavily API to gather relevant, current information on the topic
4. **Processes search results** by splitting and aggregating content for AI processing
5. **Generates platform-specific content** using OpenAI agents for LinkedIn, Facebook, and blog formats
6. **Aggregates all content** into a single output with all three platform versions
7. **Sends Slack notification** with all generated content for review and distribution

**Key Innovation: Multi-Platform AI Content Generation** - Unlike traditional content tools that create one piece of content, this system automatically generates three different versions optimized for each platform's unique audience, format requirements, and engagement patterns, all based on current web research and AI-powered adaptation.
