It's perfect for businesses that want to streamline their content creation process, maintain a consistent brand voice, and leverage AI to create platform-specific content that resonates with their target audience.\n\n## How it works / What it does\n\nThis workflow creates an **automated content creation system** that transforms form submissions into multi-platform content. The system:\n\n1. **Receives form submissions** with content subject and target audience through n8n form trigger\n2. **Extracts search parameters** from form data to prepare for web research\n3. **Searches the web** using Tavily API to gather relevant, current information on the topic\n4. **Processes search results** by splitting and aggregating content for AI processing\n5. **Generates platform-specific content** using OpenAI agents for LinkedIn, Facebook, and blog formats\n6. **Aggregates all content** into a single output with all three platform versions\n7. **Sends Slack notification** with all generated content for review and distribution\n\n**Key Innovation: Multi-Platform AI Content Generation** - Unlike traditional content tools that create one piece of content, this system automatically generates three different versions optimized for each platform's unique audience, format requirements, and engagement patterns, all based on current web research and AI-powered adaptation.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### 1. Configure Form Trigger\n- Set up n8n form trigger with \"Content Subject\" and \"Target Audience\" fields\n- Configure form settings and validation rules\n- Test form submission functionality\n- Ensure proper data flow to subsequent nodes\n\n### 2. Configure OpenAI API\n- Set up OpenAI API credentials in n8n\n- Ensure proper API access and quota limits\n- Configure the OpenAI Chat Model node for content generation\n- Test AI model connectivity and response quality\n\n### 3. Configure Tavily API\n- **Get your API key**: Sign up at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) and obtain your API key from the dashboard\n- **Add API key to workflow**: In the \"Search Web\" HTTP Request node, replace `\"ADD YOU API KEY HERE\"` with your actual Tavily API key\n- **Example configuration**:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"api_key\": \"your-actual-api-key-here\",\n    \"query\": \"{{ $json.query.replace(/\\\"/g, '\\\\\\\"') }}\",\n    \"search_depth\": \"basic\",\n    \"include_answer\": true,\n    \"topic\": \"news\",\n    \"include_raw_content\": true,\n    \"max_results\": 3\n  }\n  ```\n- **Configure search parameters**: Ensure max_results is set to 3 and search_depth to \"basic\" for optimal performance\n- **Test API connectivity**: Run a test execution to verify search results are returned correctly\n\n### 4. Configure Slack Integration\n- Set up Slack API credentials in n8n\n- Configure Slack channel ID for content delivery\n- Set up proper message formatting for content display\n- Test Slack notification delivery\n\n### 5. Test the Complete Workflow\n- Submit test form with sample content subject and target audience\n- Verify web search returns relevant results\n- Check that AI generates appropriate content for all three platforms\n- Confirm Slack notification contains all generated content\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **n8n instance** with form trigger and HTTP request capabilities\n- **OpenAI API** access for AI-powered content generation\n- **Tavily API** credentials for web search functionality\n- **Slack workspace** with API access for content delivery\n- **Active internet connection** for real-time API interactions\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify Content Generation Parameters\n- Adjust the number of web search results (currently set to 3)\n- Add more search depth options (basic, advanced, comprehensive)\n- Implement content length controls for different platforms\n- Add content tone and style preferences\n\n### Enhance AI Capabilities\n- Customize AI prompts for specific industries or niches\n- Add support for multiple languages\n- Implement brand voice consistency across all platforms\n- Add content quality scoring and optimization\n\n### Expand Content Sources\n- Integrate with additional research APIs (Google Search, Bing, etc.)\n- Add support for internal knowledge base integration\n- Implement trending topic detection\n- Add competitor content analysis\n\n### Improve Content Delivery\n- Add email notifications alongside Slack\n- Implement content scheduling capabilities\n- Add content approval workflows\n- Implement content performance tracking\n\n### Business Features\n- Add content analytics and performance metrics\n- Implement A/B testing for different content versions\n- Add content calendar integration\n- Implement team collaboration features\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Multi-platform content generation** -
