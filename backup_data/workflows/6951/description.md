Effortless Captions for Your Social Photos – Fully Automated

Save time and keep your content fresh. This workflow automatically grabs photos from a Google Drive folder, analyzes them using AI (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini), writes an engaging, Instagram-ready caption, and stores everything neatly in Airtable. Once used, the photo is moved to a separate folder so you never repeat posts.

🔹 Works with Google Drive, OpenAI & Airtable
🔹 No emojis, hashtags, or fluff—just solid, engaging captions
🔹 Perfect for content creators, marketers, and social media teams
