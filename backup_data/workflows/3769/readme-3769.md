## ⚙️ How This Workflow Works

This workflow guides you through the entire SEO keyword research process, from entering the initial keyword to receiving detailed insights and related keyword suggestions.

### 1. 🗣️ User Input (Keyword Query)
- The user enters a **keyword** they want to research.
- This input is captured by the **Chat Input Node**, ready for analysis.

### 2. 🤖 AI Agent (Input Verification)
- The AI Agent reviews the keyword input for any **grammatical errors** or extra commentary.
- If necessary, it cleans the input to ensure a seamless query to the API.

### 3. 🔑 Ahrefs API (Keyword Data Retrieval)
- The cleaned **keyword** is sent to the **Ahrefs Keyword Tool API**.
- This retrieves a detailed report including metrics like **search volume**, **keyword difficulty**, and **CPC**.

### 4. 💡 Related Keywords Extraction (Using JavaScript Function)
- The workflow uses a **JavaScript function** to extract main keyword data and **10 related keywords data** from the Ahrefs response.
- You can tweak the script to adjust the number of related keywords or the level of detail you want.

### 5. 🧠 AI Agent (Text Formatting)
- The aggregated data, including both the main keyword and related keywords, is sent to an **AI agent**.
- The AI agent formats the data into a concise, readable format that can be shared with the user.

### 6. 📨 Final Response
- The formatted text is delivered to the user with keyword insights, recommendations, and related keyword suggestions.
