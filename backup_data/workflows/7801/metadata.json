  "description": "# **⚙ AI-Powered Social Media Automation for LinkedIn**\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\nThis workflow automates the entire social media content creation and publishing process for LinkedIn. It starts with a simple form to collect a topic or idea. The workflow then uses two AI agents to automatically generate both the written content and a unique image prompt. The AI-generated image is created, uploaded, and then downloaded before the final step, where both the content and the image are posted to your LinkedIn account.\n\n---\n\n## **Setup Steps**\n\nFollow these steps to get the workflow running in your n8n instance.\n\n### **1. Prerequisites**\nYou will need a working n8n instance and accounts for the following services:\n* **OpenAI:** For AI content and image generation.\n* **Google Drive:** To temporarily store the generated image.\n* **Gmail:** For the file upload process.\n* **LinkedIn:** To publish the final post.\n\n### **2. Workflow Import**\nImport the provided `.json` file into your n8n instance. All the necessary nodes will appear on your canvas.\n\n### **3. Configure Credentials**\nConnect the following credentials to their respective nodes:\n* **OpenAI:** Connect to the `OpenAI Chat Model`, `AI Agent Content Generator`, `Ai Agent Prompt Image generator`, and `Image-1` nodes.\n* **Google Drive:** Connect to the `Upload file` and `Download file` nodes.\n* **Gmail:** Connect to the `Send a message` node.\n* **LinkedIn:** Connect to the `Create a post` node.\n\n### **4. Customize the Trigger Form**\n1.  Click on the **`On form submission`** node.\n2.  Review and customize the form fields to fit your specific needs (e.g., add fields for hashtags, target audience, etc.).\n3.  Click **\"Share Form\"** to get the unique URL for your content ideas form.\n\n### **5. Customize AI Prompts**\n1.  Click on the **`AI Agent Content Generator`** node.\n2.  Review and adjust the **`System Message`** to refine the writing style, tone, and character limits for your LinkedIn posts.\n3.  Similarly, open the **`Ai Agent Prompt Image generator`** node and modify the **`System Message`** to guide the AI in creating images that match your brand identity.\n\n### **6. Configure Google Drive**\n1.  Click on the **`Upload file`** node.\n2.  Under the **`Parameters`** tab, select the specific **`Drive ID`** and **`Folder ID`** where you want to temporarily store the generated images.\n\n### **7. Configure the LinkedIn Post**\n1.  Click on the **`Create a post`** node.\n2.  Ensure that the `Text` and `shareMediaCategory` parameters are correctly mapped to the output of the preceding nodes to use the AI-generated text and image.\n\n### **8. Activate the Workflow**\n1.  Once all credentials and node configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Finally, toggle the workflow to **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically create and publish content upon every form submission.",
