  "description": "Currently Work-In-Progress\n\nThis n8n template creates an intelligent AI assistant that responds to chat messages, providing conversational access to your Meta Ads data. Powered by an OpenAI GPT-5 model and equipped with memory to maintain context, this agent can interact with your Meta Ads accounts via the Facebook Graph API.\n\nUsers can ask it to:\n* **List all connected ad accounts.**\n* **Retrieve detailed information** for a specific ad account, including active campaigns, ad sets, and individual ads.\n* **Fetch performance insights** (e.g., spend, impressions, conversions, CPC, CPM, CTR, ROAS) for a given account and time range.\n \nIdeal for **marketers, advertisers**, or anyone needing quick, conversational access to their Meta Ads performance data and campaign structure without logging into the Ad Manager directly.\n\nRequires: OpenAI and Facebook Graph API credentials.",
