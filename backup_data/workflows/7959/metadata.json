  "description": "**Process Physician Orders into Google Sheets with VLM Run AI Extraction**\n\n**What this workflow does**\n\n1. **Monitors Google Drive** for new physician order files in a target folder\n2. **Downloads the file** automatically inside n8n for processing\n3. **Sends the file to VLM Run** for AI transcription and structured data extraction\n4. **Parses healthcare-specific details** from the `healthcare.physician-order` domain as JSON\n5. **Appends normalized attributes** to a Google Sheet as a new row\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:** Google account, VLM Run API credentials, Google Sheets access, n8n.\nInstall the verified **VLM Run** node from the n8n node list, then click **Install**. Once installed, you can integrate it directly in your workflow.\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\n1. Create the Drive folder you want to watch and copy its **Folder ID**\n2. Create a Google Sheet with headers such as:\n   `timestamp, file_name, file_id, mime_type, size_bytes, uploader_email, patient_name, patient_dob, patient_gender, patient_address, patient_phone_no, physician_name, physician_phone_no, physician_email, referring_clinic, diagnosis, exam_date, form_signed_in`, …other physician order fields as needed\n3. Configure **Google Drive OAuth2** for the trigger and download nodes\n4. Add your **VLM Run API credentials** from [VLM Run Dashboard](https://app.vlm.run/dashboard) to the VLM Run node\n5. Configure **Google Sheets OAuth2** and set Spreadsheet ID + target tab\n6. Upload a sample physician order file to the Drive folder to test, then activate\n\n---\n\n## Perfect for\n\n* Converting physician order documents into structured, machine-readable text\n* Automating extraction of patient, physician, and clinical details with VLM Run\n* Creating a centralized archive of orders for compliance, auditing, or reporting\n* Reducing manual data entry and ensuring consistent formatting\n\n---\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n* **End-to-end automation** from Drive upload to structured Google Sheets row\n* **AI-powered accuracy** using VLM Run’s healthcare-specific extraction models\n* **Standardized attribute mapping** for patient and physician records\n* **Instantly searchable archive** directly in Google Sheets\n* **Hands-free processing** once the workflow is activated\n\n---\n\n## How to customize\n\n**Extend by adding:**\n\n* Attribute-specific parsing (e.g., ICD/CPT diagnosis codes, insurance details)\n* Automatic classification of orders by specialty, urgency, or exam type\n* Slack, Teams, or email notifications when new physician orders are logged\n* Keyword tagging for fast filtering and downstream workflows\n* Error-handling rules that move failed conversions into a review folder or error sheet\n",
