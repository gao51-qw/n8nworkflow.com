## **Problem:**
🚨It is difficult to manually track changing flight prices and quickly identify the best time to book a ticket. Many travelers miss deals or spend too much time monitoring fares for their specific routes and travel dates.

## **Prerequisites:**
- An active SerpAPI account (for flight search API access)
- Gmail or another email service account (for email alerts)


## **This would be helpful for:**
- Frequent flyers wanting to book flights at the lowest price
- Budget travelers planning trips in advance
- Corporate travelers managing travel expenses
- Travel agencies monitoring deals for clients

## **Step-by-step workflow:**
Takes 5-10 minutes to set up

1. Set your preferred flight route and travel date
2. Choose the price alert threshold
3. Automatically monitor flight prices at your selected interval
4. Get notified by email when a price drop is detected

## **Sample Query**

*Input:*
Origin: “JFK” (New York)
Destination: “SEA” (Seattle)
Outbound Date: “2025-09-06”
Price Threshold: $250
Notification Email: your@email.com

*Output:*
If flight from JFK to SEA on 2025-09-06 drops to $250 or below, you’ll receive an email notification:
“Hi! The flight price to Seattle just dropped to $242. Book your ticket now!”
