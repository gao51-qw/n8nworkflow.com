## ❓ What Problem Does It Solve?

This workflow embedd error detection and notification directly within your n8n instance.

This drastically reduces your response time to issues and streamlines error management, improving your automation reliability and operational confidence.

## 🔧 What This Workflow Does

⏱ **Trigger:** Listens for any error generated in your n8n workflows using the n8n Error Trigger node.

🔍 **Step 3:** Sends the formatted error notification to multiple communication channels: Telegram and Gmail by default, plus optionally Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp (disabled by default).

💌 **Step 4:** Delivers rich, parsed HTML-formatted messages to ensure error readability and immediate actionability.
