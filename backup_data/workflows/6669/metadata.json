You need to:\n- Come up with ideas\n- Write compelling scripts\n- Generate visuals\n- Adapt content for each platform\n- Manually publish and track results\n\nThis workflow automates that entire process and turns a single idea into a ready-to-publish video campaign across 9 platforms.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n1. **Triggers** via Telegram when a new video idea is submitted  \n2. **Fetches parameters** (style, tone, duration) from Google Sheets  \n3. **Generates the video script** using GPT-4 and a master AI prompt  \n4. **Creates the video** using Google’s VEO3 video generation model  \n5. **Downloads the final video** once rendering is complete  \n6. **Rewrites the caption** with GPT-4o for platform-optimized posting  \n7. **Logs the result** in Google Sheets for tracking  \n8. **Sends preview links** to Telegram for review  \n9. **Auto-posts** the video to 9 platforms using Blotato (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Bluesky)\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Install **n8n (self-hosted)** with Community Nodes enabled  \n2. Connect your **Telegram Bot Token** to the trigger node  \n3. Add your **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-4 and GPT-4o models  \n4. Configure your **VEO3 API access** (Google AI Studio)  \n5. Set up **Blotato** with your platform tokens & IDs  \n6. Link your **Google Sheets** and set the expected column structure (idea, style, caption, etc.)  \n7. Adjust the Telegram trigger format (e.g., `idea: ...`) to your team’s input style\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Edit the **master prompt** to match your brand voice or industry  \n- Replace the **caption prompt** to generate more marketing-style hooks  \n- Modify the **platform list** if you only publish to a few specific channels  \n- Add approval steps (Slack, email, Telegram) before publishing  \n- Integrate tracking by pushing published URLs to your analytics or CRM  \n\n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/Create-and-Auto-Post-Viral-AI-Videos-with-VEO3-and-Blotato-to-9-Platforms-23f3d6550fd98037ab1ee9f803400666?source=copy_link)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
