  "description": "## 🧠 RAG AI Medical Agent – n8n Workflow\n\n## 👥 Who’s it for\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n- **Healthcare ecommerce businesses** that want to automate product recommendations.\n- **Founders or developers** building an AI assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with product data.\n- **Anyone** wanting to combine OpenAI, Qdrant vector search, and Google Sheets to power intelligent medical queries.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\nThis RAG-based workflow allows users to **ask medical questions** related to hair or scalp issues (e.g., hair loss, thinning). It:\n\n1. Retrieves product info from a **Google Sheet**.\n2. Converts product data into **text embeddings** using OpenAI.\n3. Stores those embeddings in a **Qdrant vector database**.\n4. On chat message trigger, performs a **vector similarity search** to match user symptoms with relevant products.\n5. Uses an **AI agent** to respond with top 3 matching products from your catalog.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to set up\n\n## Step 1: 🗂 Get your data\n- Make sure your **Google Sheet** contains the following columns:\n  - `Product Name`\n  - `Symptoms Involved`\n  - `Product Description`\n  - `ForeverBetty Product Page Link`\n  - `Category` (optional but recommended)\n\n## Step 2: 🔐 Connect your accounts\n- Add your **Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials** in the \"Get all products\" node.\n- Add your **OpenAI API key** in the embedding nodes.\n- Add your **Qdrant credentials** in the vector store nodes.\n\n## Step 3: 🧠 Populate the Vector DB\n1. Click **“Execute workflow”** manually.\n2. This pulls data from the Google Sheet.\n3. Each row is:\n   - Formatted properly into a vector-friendly string.\n   - Converted into an embedding using OpenAI.\n   - Stored into Qdrant.\n\n## Step 4: 💬 Enable Chat Interface\n- Use the **ChatTrigger** to receive user queries.\n- The agent searches Qdrant for relevant vectors.\n- Replies with product suggestions via LangChain's LLM agent.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n- 🧠 **n8n**\n- 📄 A Google Sheet with product data.\n- 🔐 Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials.\n- 🧠 OpenAI API key (for embeddings + chat LLM).\n- 🗃️ Qdrant Vector DB instance (Cloud or self-hosted).\n---\n\n## 🧩 How to customize it\n\n## 🔄 Change the data structure\n- Update the \"Set Data Properly in vector database\" node to modify what fields are embedded.\n- Example:\n  ```handlebars\n  --- \n  Product: {{ $json['Product Name '] }}\n  Use-case: {{ $json['Symptoms Involved'] }}\n  Link: {{ $json['ForeverBetty Product Page Link '] }}\n",
