# 🛠 Website Downtime Monitoring with Scheduled Checks and Email Alerts

Easily monitor your website uptime and receive instant email alerts when it becomes unreachable — using this no-code template powered by [n8n](https://n8n.io/), a free and flexible workflow automation tool.

This ready-to-use workflow periodically checks your website’s status and sends an alert email if it’s down.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

- **Schedule Website Check**  
  Triggers the workflow at regular intervals (e.g., every 8 hours by default).

- **Check Website Status**  
  Sends an HTTP GET request to your site.

- **Evaluate Response**  
  Determines if the site is reachable (expects HTTP status `200`).

- **Send Downtime Alert**  
  If the site is down, an alert email is sent to the specified address.

## 🔧 Steps to Customize

### 1. HTTP Request Node
Replace `https://yourdomain.com` with your actual website URL.

### 2. Send Email Node
Update the `To Email` and `From Email` fields with your addresses.

### 3. Adjust Monitoring Frequency
Modify the **Schedule Trigger** node to run every 5 minutes, hourly, or as needed.

## ✅ SMTP Configuration Instructions

Before emails can be sent, you need to configure SMTP credentials in n8n.

### 📨 Option 1: Gmail SMTP Setup

&gt; **Note:** Gmail requires App Passwords (not your regular Gmail password) and 2FA to be enabled.

#### Steps:
1. Go to [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable **2-Step Verification**.
3. Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
4. Create a new app password (choose **Mail** and **Other**, name it `n8n`).
5. In n8n:
   - Go to **Credentials** → **Create New** → **SMTP**.
   - Use the following values:
     - **Host**: `smtp.gmail.com`
     - **Port**: `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
     - **User**: your Gmail address (e.g., `you@gmail.com`)
     - **Password**: the App Password you generated

### ✉️ Option 2: Generic SMTP Setup

Use this if you're using your hosting provider's or business email SMTP server.

#### Example Values:
- **Host**: `smtp.yourdomain.com` or provider-specific (e.g., `smtp.sendgrid.net`)
- **Port**: `587` (TLS) or `465` (SSL)
- **User**: your email address (e.g., `alerts@yourdomain.com`)
- **Password**: your email/SMTP password
- **Secure**: Yes (if using 465 or TLS-enabled 587)

Then in the workflow's **Send Email** node, select the SMTP credentials you created.

## 📌 Requirements

- A running instance of n8n (self-hosted or n8n.cloud)
- SMTP credentials configured in n8n for email delivery
- Basic familiarity with the n8n visual editor

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- **Rename Nodes**: Use clear, descriptive names for maintainability.
- **Sticky Notes**: Use stickies on the canvas to help explain logic for others.
- **Expand Alerts**: Integrate with Slack, Discord, or Telegram for multi-channel alerts.
