# A RAG Chatbot with n8n and Pinecone Vector Database  

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide **context-aware answers** by retrieving information from an external vector database. In this post, we’ll walk through a complete **n8n workflow** that builds a chatbot capable of answering company policy questions using **Pinecone Vector Database** and **OpenAI models**.  

Our setup has two main parts:  

1. **Data Loading to RAG** – documents (company policies) are ingested from Google Drive, processed, embedded, and stored in Pinecone.  
2. **Data Retrieval using RAG** – user queries are routed through an AI Agent that uses Pinecone to retrieve relevant information and generate precise answers.

## 1. Data Loading to RAG  

This workflow section handles **document ingestion**. Whenever a new policy file is uploaded to Google Drive, it is automatically processed and indexed in Pinecone.  

**Nodes involved:**  

- **Google Drive Trigger**  
  Watches a specific folder in Google Drive. Any new or updated file triggers the workflow.  

- **Google Drive (Download)**  
  Fetches the file (e.g., a PDF policy document) from Google Drive for processing.  

- **Recursive Character Text Splitter**  
  Splits long documents into smaller chunks (with a defined overlap). This ensures embeddings remain context-rich and retrieval works effectively.  

- **Default Data Loader**  
  Reads the binary document (PDF in this setup) and extracts the text.  

- **OpenAI Embeddings**  
  Generates high-dimensional vector representations of each text chunk using OpenAI’s embedding models.  

- **Pinecone Vector Store (Insert Mode)**  
  Stores the embeddings into a Pinecone index (`n8ntest`), under a chosen namespace. This step makes the policy data searchable by semantic similarity.  

👉 **Example flow**: When HR uploads a new *Work From Home Policy* PDF to Google Drive, it is automatically split, embedded, and indexed in Pinecone.

## 2. Data Retrieval using RAG  

Once documents are loaded into Pinecone, the chatbot is ready to handle user queries. This section of the workflow connects the **chat interface**, **AI Agent**, and **retrieval pipeline**.  

**Nodes involved:**  

- **When Chat Message Received**  
  Acts as the webhook entry point when a user sends a question to the chatbot.  

- **AI Agent**  
  The core reasoning engine. It is configured with a **system message** instructing it to only use Pinecone-backed knowledge when answering.  

- **Simple Memory**  
  Keeps track of the conversation context, so the bot can handle multi-turn queries.  

- **Vector Store QnA Tool**  
  Queries Pinecone for the most relevant chunks related to the user’s question. In this workflow, it is configured to fetch company policy documents.  

- **Pinecone Vector Store (Query Mode)**  
  Acts as the connection to Pinecone, fetching embeddings that best match the query.  

- **OpenAI Chat Model**  
  Refines the retrieved chunks into a natural and concise answer. The model ensures answers remain grounded in the source material.  

- **Calculator Tool**  
  Optional helper if the query involves numerical reasoning (e.g., leave calculations or benefit amounts).  

👉 **Example flow**: A user asks *“How many work-from-home days are allowed per month?”*. The AI Agent queries Pinecone through the Vector Store QnA tool, retrieves the relevant section of the HR policy, and returns a concise answer grounded in the actual document.

## Wrapping Up  

By combining **n8n automation**, **Pinecone for vector storage**, and **OpenAI for embeddings + LLM reasoning**, we’ve created a **self-updating RAG chatbot**.  

- **Data Loading pipeline** ensures that every new company policy document uploaded to Google Drive is immediately available for semantic search.  
- **Data Retrieval pipeline** allows employees to ask natural language questions and get document-backed answers.  

This setup can easily be adapted for other domains — compliance manuals, tax regulations, legal contracts, or even product documentation.
