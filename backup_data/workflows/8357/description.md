## AI-Powered Gmail Auto-Labeler

Automatically organize your Gmail inbox with seamless, dynamic AI classification! This workflow leverages Google Gemini’s latest model to continually sort new emails into your own custom Gmail labels—no manual intervention or tedious setup required.

## 🚀 What This Workflow Does

- **Watches for Unread Emails:**
Continuously polls your Gmail inbox for new unread emails (polling interval can be changed as needed).

- **Fetches All Available Labels:**
Dynamically syncs every custom & system label from your Gmail account—no hardcoded lists.

- **AI-Based Classification:**
Each new email’s subject and snippet/body are sent to the Gemini 2.5 Pro AI, which analyzes content and recommends the best matching label(s) from your own label list (not made up!).

- **Accurate Label Application:**
The workflow maps Gemini’s label name suggestions to the correct label IDs in Gmail and auto-applies one or more labels directly to each email.

- **Self-Updating / No Maintenance:**
If you add/change Gmail labels, the workflow always uses the current label list. You don’t need to update any configuration or nodes (completely dynamic).

- **Supports Multiple Simultaneous Labels:**
Gemini can assign several labels at once—perfect for nuanced sorting (ex: “Receipts”, “Work”, "Travel").

## 🔧 How to Set Up

**Connect Credentials:**

- Google Gmail account (OAuth2)

- Gemini API key (for Google Gemini)

- (Optional) Adjust Gmail Labels:
Add, rename, or customize labels in Gmail to suit your sorting preferences. You can continue to modify these at any time!

- Activate the Workflow:
Turn on the workflow. It starts processing new emails immediately.
No need to edit code or update nodes when labels change.

- (Optional) Customize Filtering or Post-Processing:

The default trigger checks for unread messages, but you can adjust this (e.g., all messages, specific senders, etc.).

Add extra workflow steps as desired for downstream automation.

## 📝 Key Features & Best Practices
