## **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

1. **Import the Template**  
   - Download the JSON file you received upon purchase.  
   - In your n8n instance, go to *Workflows* → *Import*, then upload the JSON file.

2. **Configure Ideogram API**  
   - In n8n, create an HTTP Header Auth credential.  
   - For the “Authorization” header, use `Bearer YOUR_IDEOGRAM_API_KEY`.  
   - Attach this credential to the Ideogram-related nodes (e.g., *IDEOGRAM Image generator*, *ideogram Upscale*).

3. **Google Sheets Setup**  
   - Copy or create a Google Sheet with the columns listed above.  
   - In the template, locate the Google Sheets “Append” nodes.  
   - Select the correct Sheet, tab, and map each column accordingly.

4. **Google Drive Folder**  
   - Create a Drive folder to store images (sharing permissions are up to you).  
   - In the Google Drive nodes, enter the folder ID to save new images there.

5. **Basic Auth for Login**  
   - Open the *Login Webhook-ideoGener8r* node.  
   - Set it to use Basic Auth and create credentials for a username/password.  
   - This will secure the login route (e.g., `/ideogener8r-login`).

6. **Bearer Token for Generation & History**  
   - Open the “Generation Webhook” (e.g., `/ideogen`) and “History Webhook” (e.g., `/ideogener8r-history`).  
   - Set them to Header Auth and use `Authorization: Bearer &lt;YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN&gt;`.  
   - Any requests to these endpoints must include that token in the header.

7. **Publish & Test**  
   - Activate or publish your workflow.  
   - Go to `/ideogener8r-login`, enter your Basic Auth credentials, and test by generating images.  
   - Verify that images appear in your Google Drive folder, and the metadata is logged in the Google Sheet.

## **Ideogram API Details**  
- **Endpoint**: The template uses Ideogram’s `/generate`, `/upscale`, and `/remix` endpoints.  
- **Headers**: You must provide your API key as a `Bearer` token in the request header.  
- **Rate Limits**: Check your Ideogram AI account for any usage or rate-limiting policies.
