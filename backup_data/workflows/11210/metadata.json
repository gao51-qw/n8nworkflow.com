  "description": "Stay ahead of the curve with the latest Artificial Intelligence research from MIT, delivered directly to your Discord server—clean, filtered, and duplicate-free.\n\nThis workflow is perfect for AI agencies, researchers, and tech teams who want to stay informed without the noise.\n\n## How it works\nThis workflow runs automatically every day (default 9:00 AM) to:\n1. **Fetch** the official MIT News RSS feed for the \"Artificial Intelligence\" topic.\n2. **Filter** articles to keep only those published in the last 24 hours.\n3. **Deduplicate** content using an internal **n8n Data Table**. It checks if the article link has already been sent to prevent spamming old news.\n4. **Notify** your team on Discord with a clean, formatted message including the Title, Author, Date, and Link.\n\n## Setup steps\n### 1. Create the Data Table (Mandatory)\nThis workflow relies on n8n Data Tables to track sent articles. Before running:\n1. Go to your n8n Dashboard &gt; **Data Tables**.\n2. Create a new table named: `mit_ai_news_sent`\n3. Add these exact columns:\n   * `creator` (Type: String)\n   * `title` (Type: String)\n   * `link` (Type: String)\n   * `pubDate` (Type: Date)\n\n### 2. Connect the Table\n1. Import this template.\n2. Open the orange nodes named **\"Avoid Duplicated Articles\"** and **\"Register New Article\"**.\n3. Select the `mit_ai_news_sent` table you just created from the list.\n\n### 3. Configure Discord\n1. Create a Webhook in your Discord Server (Server Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Webhooks).\n2. Open the **\"MIT AI Articles\"** node.\n3. Create a new Credential and paste your Webhook URL.",
