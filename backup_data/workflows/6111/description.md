## Overview

This n8n template automatically sends personalized recovery emails to customers who abandon their shopping carts. Recover 15-25% of lost sales with intelligent, well-timed follow-up emails that include exact cart contents.
Use cases: Online stores, e-commerce brands, subscription services, digital product sales, any business with cart abandonment.

## How it works

Shopify webhook triggers when customer creates cart and begins checkout process. The workflow waits one hour then checks if cart was converted to completed order. If cart remains abandoned, it extracts customer email and cart details. A personalized email is generated with cart contents and direct checkout link. Customer receives gentle reminder and can complete purchase with one click.
