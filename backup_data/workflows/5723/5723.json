It is especially beneficial for:\n\n- **🛡️ GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) Professionals**: Streamline your risk assessment processes\n- **🔒 Information Security Teams**: Quickly evaluate the security posture of third-party vendors\n- **📋 Procurement Departments**: Enhance due diligence when onboarding new service providers\n- **🚀 Startup Founders**: Efficiently assess vendors without a dedicated security team\n\nThis tool is perfect for anyone looking to automate the manual review of vendor websites, policies, and company data. ✨\n\n## 🎯 What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nManual vendor due diligence is a time-consuming process that can take hours for a single vendor. This workflow automates over **80%** of these manual tasks, which typically include:\n\n- 🔍 Finding and organizing basic vendor information\n- 🏢 Researching the company's background\n- 📄 Collecting links to key documents like Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, and Trust Pages\n- 📖 Manually reviewing each document to extract risk-relevant information\n- 📊 Compiling all findings into a formatted report or spreadsheet for record-keeping\n\nBy leveraging **Gemini** for structured parsing and web scraping with live internet data, this workflow frees you up to focus on critical analysis and final review. ⚡\n\n## ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\nThis end-to-end automated **n8n workflow** performs the following steps:\n\n1. **📝 Intake**: Begins with a simple form to capture the vendor's name, the business use case, and the type of data they will handle\n2. **🔎 Background Research**: Gathers essential background information on the company\n3. **⚠️ Risk Analysis**: Conducts comprehensive research on various risk-related topics\n4. **🔗 URL Extraction**: Finds and validates public URLs for privacy policies, security pages, and trust centers\n5. **📈 Risk Assessment**: Generates a structured risk score and a detailed assessment based on the collected content and context\n6. **📤 Export**: Exports the final results to a Google Sheet for easy access and record-keeping\n\n## 🚀 Setup\n\nTo get started with this workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. **🔑 Configure Credentials**: Set up your API credentials for Gemini and Jina AI\n2. **📊 Connect Google Sheets**: Authenticate your Google Sheets account and configure the the Sheet where you want to store the results\n3. **🔗 Download** the Google Sheet template for your assessment ouput from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PCpZ9wMPFvm4vubiPBqw021Lz8JiHUnr-EWl1cdIKYY/edit?usp=sharing)\n4. **⚙️ (Optional) Customize Prompts**: Adjust the prompts within the workflow to better suit your specific needs\n5. **🎯 (Optional) Align Risk Framework**: Modify the risk questions to align with your organization's internal vendor risk framework\n",
