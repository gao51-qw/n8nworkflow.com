## What it Does
Automatically checks your Google Calendar to determine if you're officially off work for the rest of today. If so, it auto-sends a personalized out‑of‑office reply via Gmail, telling senders when you’ll be back—based on your next calendar entry within the next 2 weeks.

## Prerequisites
To use this template, you'll need:
- Gmail credentials (for the trigger and reply nodes)
- Google Calendar credentials (for both calendar checks)
- A dedicated work calendar selected in the Calendar nodes

## Workflow Logic
1. Gmail Trigger
- Monitors incoming emails every minute
- Can be filtered (e.g., labels or VIP senders)

2. Calendar Check #1
- Inspects if any events remain today

3. Calendar Check #2
- If no remaining events, scan the next 14 days for the next event

4. Function Node
- Formats the return date as Weekday, Month D, YYYY (e.g., “Thursday, July 24, 2025”)

5. Gmail Send
- Sends a customized out‑of‑office email, using the formatted date
- Optionally includes n8n attribution (editable)

## User Setup Instructions
- Gmail Trigger: Connect your Gmail account and add any desired filters (labels, senders).
- Google Calendar Nodes: Connect your calendar account and select your “work” calendar in both nodes.
- Function Node: No changes needed unless you prefer a different date format.
- Gmail Send Node: Edit the message template and toggle attribution as desired.

## Customization - Options
Edit the final email content and tone in the Send node
- Adjust calendar lookahead in Calendar Check #2 (default is 14 days)
- Add Gmail filters to restrict auto-replies (e.g. only specific senders or labels)

## Why It's Useful
Ideal for freelancers, consultants, or remote workers who don’t follow a strict 9–5, yet want automated responses aligned with their actual availability, not a static setting. It’s dynamic, real-time, and easy to tweak.
