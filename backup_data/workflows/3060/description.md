# **Automate Actions After PDF Generation with PDFMonkey in n8n**  

## **Overview**  
This n8n workflow template allows you to automatically react to PDF generation events from **PDFMonkey**. When a new PDF is successfully created, this workflow retrieves the file and processes it based on your needs—whether it’s sending it via email, saving it to cloud storage, or integrating it with other apps.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Trigger:** The workflow listens for a **PDFMonkey webhook event** when a new PDF is generated.  
2. **Retrieve PDF:** It fetches the newly generated PDF file from PDFMonkey.  
3. **Process & Action:** Depending on the outcome:  
   - ✅ **On success:** The workflow downloads the PDF and can distribute or store it.  
   - ❌ **On failure:** It handles errors accordingly (e.g., sending alerts, retrying, or logging the issue).  

## **Configuration**  
To set up this workflow, follow these steps:  
1. Copy the **Webhook URL** generated by n8n.  
2. Go to your **PDFMonkey Webhooks dashboard** and paste the URL in the appropriate field to define the callback URL.  
3. Save your settings and trigger a test to ensure proper integration.

## **Use Cases**  
This workflow is ideal for:  
- Automating **invoice processing** (e.g., sending PDFs to customers via email).  
- **Archiving reports** in cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3).  
- **Sending notifications** via Slack, Microsoft Teams, or WhatsApp when a new PDF is available.  
- **Logging generated PDFs** in Airtable, Notion, or a database for tracking.  

## **Customization**  
You can customize this workflow to:  
- **Add conditional logic** (e.g., different actions based on the document type).  
- **Enhance security** (e.g., encrypting PDFs before sharing).  
- **Extend integrations** by connecting with CRM tools, task managers, or analytics platforms.
