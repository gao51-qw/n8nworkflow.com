  "description": "\n\n## Amazon Product Scraper with Scrape.do & AI Enrichment\n\n\n\n&gt; This workflow is a fully automated Amazon product data extraction engine. It reads product URLs from a Google Sheet, uses Scrape.do to reliably fetch each product page’s HTML without getting blocked, and then applies an AI-powered extraction process to capture key product details such as name, price, rating, review count, and description. All structured results are neatly stored back into a Google Sheet for easy access and analysis.\n\nThis template is designed for consistency and scalability—ideal for marketers, analysts, and e-commerce professionals who need clean product data at scale.\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 What does this workflow do?\n\n*   **Reads Input URLs:** Pulls a list of Amazon product URLs from a Google Sheet.\n*   **Scrapes HTML Reliably:** Uses **Scrape.do** to bypass Amazon’s anti-bot measures, ensuring the page HTML is always retrieved successfully.\n*   **Cleans & Pre-processes HTML:** Strips scripts, styles, and unnecessary markup, isolating only relevant sections like title, price, ratings, and feature bullets.\n*   **AI-Powered Data Extraction:** A LangChain/OpenRouter GPT-4 node verifies and enriches key fields—product name, price, rating, reviews, and description.\n*   **Stores Structured Results:** Appends all extracted and verified product data to a results tab in Google Sheets.\n*   **Batch & Loop Control:** Handles multiple URLs efficiently with `Split In Batches` to process as many products as you need.\n\n### 🎯 Who is this for?\n\n*   **E-commerce Sellers & Dropshippers:** Track competitor prices, ratings, and key product features automatically.\n*   **Marketing & SEO Teams:** Collect product descriptions and reviews to optimize campaigns and content.\n*   **Analysts & Data Teams:** Build accurate product databases without manual copy-paste work.\n\n### ✨ Benefits\n\n*   **High Success Rate:** **Scrape.do** handles proxy rotation and CAPTCHA challenges automatically, outperforming traditional scrapers.\n*   **AI Validation:** LLM verification ensures data accuracy and fills in gaps when HTML elements vary.\n*   **Full Automation:** Runs on-demand or on a schedule to keep product datasets fresh.\n*   **Clean Output:** Results are neatly organized in Google Sheets, ready for reporting or integration with other tools.\n\n### ⚙️ How it Works\n\n1.  **Manual or Scheduled Trigger:** Start the workflow manually or via a cron schedule.\n2.  **Input Source:** Fetch URLs from a Google Sheet (`TRACK_SHEET_GID`).\n3.  **Scrape with Scrape.do:** Retrieve full HTML from each Amazon product page using your `SCRAPEDO_TOKEN`.\n4.  **Clean & Pre-Extract:** Strip irrelevant code and use regex to pre-extract key fields.\n5.  **AI Extraction & Verification:** LangChain GPT-4 model refines and validates product name, description, price, rating, and reviews.\n6.  **Save Results:** Append enriched product data to the results sheet (`RESULTS_SHEET_GID`).\n\n### 📋 n8n Nodes Used\n\n*   `Manual Trigger` / `Schedule Trigger`\n*   `Google Sheets` (read & append)\n*   `Split In Batches`\n*   `HTTP Request` (Scrape.do)\n*   `Code` (clean & pre-extract HTML)\n*   `LangChain LLM` (OpenRouter GPT-4)\n*   `Structured Output Parser`\n\n### 🔑 Prerequisites\n\n*   Active n8n instance.\n*   **Scrape.do API token** (bypasses Amazon anti-bot measures).\n*   **Google Sheets** with:\n    *   `TRACK_SHEET_GID`: tab containing product URLs.\n    *   `RESULTS_SHEET_GID`: tab for results.\n*   **Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials** shared with your service account.\n*   **OpenRouter / OpenAI API credentials** for the GPT-4 model.\n\n### 🛠️ Setup\n\n1.  **Import the Workflow** into your n8n instance.\n2.  **Set Workflow Variables:**\n    *   `SCRAPEDO_TOKEN` – your Scrape.do API key.\n    *   `WEB_SHEET_ID` – Google Sheet ID.\n    *   `TRACK_SHEET_GID` – sheet/tab name for input URLs.\n    *   `RESULTS_SHEET_GID` – sheet/tab name for results.\n3.  **Configure Credentials** for Google Sheets and OpenRouter.\n4.  **Map Columns** in the “add results” node to match your Google Sheet (e.g., name, price, rating, reviews, description).\n5.  **Run or Schedule:** Start manually or configure a schedule for continuous data extraction.\n\n---\nThis Amazon Product Scraper delivers fast, reliable, and AI-enriched product data, ensuring your e-commerce analytics, pricing strategies, or market research stay accurate and fully automated.",
