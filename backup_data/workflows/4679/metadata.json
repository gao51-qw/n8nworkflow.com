  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nProfessionals, solopreneurs, or productivity enthusiasts who want to keep their Gmail inbox clean and organized without manual effort.\n\n## What problem does this solve?\n\nManually archiving emails clutters your time and slows you down.

Connect your Gmail account using OAuth2 credentials.\n2. Customize the **Schedule Trigger** node to adjust the run time.\n3. Modify the Gmail filter if you want to archive unread or labeled emails instead.\n\n\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Schedule different frequencies (e.g. twice a day or weekly).\n\n## 🔄 Pairs Well With\n\nThis complements the [Intelligent Email Organization with AI-Powered Content Classification](https://n8n.io/workflows/4557-intelligent-email-organization-with-ai-powered-content-classification-for-gmail/) workflow.\n\nUse that to **label emails smartly using AI**, and this one to **auto-archive** them for a clean, clutter-free inbox.",
