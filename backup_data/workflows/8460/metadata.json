  "description": "This n8n workflow converts invoices in PDF format into a **structured, ready-to-use JSON**, using **AI and XML transformation** — without writing any code.\n\n#### 🚀 How it works\n\n1. **Upload form** → The user uploads a PDF file.\n2. **Text extraction** → The PDF content is extracted as plain text.\n3. **XML schema definition** → A standard invoice structure is defined with fields such as:\n\n   * Invoice number\n   * Customer and issuer details\n   * Items with description, quantity, and price\n   * Totals and taxes\n   * Bank account details\n4. **AI (Gemini)** → The model rewrites the PDF text into a **valid XML** following the predefined schema.\n5. **XML cleanup** → Removes extra tags, line breaks, and unnecessary formatting.\n6. **JSON conversion** → The XML is transformed into a clean, structured JSON object, ready for integrations, APIs, or storage.\n\n#### ✨ Benefits\n\n* Transforms **unstructured PDFs** into **normalized JSON data**.\n* No coding required, only n8n nodes.\n* Scalable to different invoice formats with minimal adjustments.\n* Leverages AI to interpret complex textual content.\n\n#### 🛠️ Use cases\n\n* Automating invoice data capture.\n* Integration with ERPs, CRMs, or databases.\n* Generating financial reports from PDFs.",
