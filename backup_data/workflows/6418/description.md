### How It Works
1. **Trigger**
   Watches for new emails with attachments in a Gmail label.
2. **Extract Data**
   * Extracts job code from the email subject (e.g., `FN-001`)
   * Extracts raw text from the attached CV (PDF)
3. **AI Parsing**
   Uses Google Gemini to parse the CV and extract:
   * Name
   * Email
   * Years of experience
   * Skills
4. **Job Lookup**
   Uses the extracted job code to retrieve job details from Airtable.
5. **AI Scoring**
   * Compares applicant data with job requirements
   * Scores from 1–100
   * Generates a brief reasoning summary (in Bahasa Indonesia)
6. **Log to Airtable**
   Saves applicant data, score, and AI notes to the "Applications" table.
