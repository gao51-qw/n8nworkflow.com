## What Does This Flow Do?

This workflow demonstrates how to dynamically generate a line chart using the QuickChart node based on data provided in a JSON object and then upload the resulting chart image to Google Drive.

## Use Cases

* You can use it in presentations or requesting for chart generation from a software with HTTP requests.
* Automated report generation (e.g., daily sales charts).
* Visualizing data fetched from APIs or databases.
* Simple monitoring dashboards.
* Adding charts to internal tools or notifications.

## How it Works

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts manually when you click 'Test workflow'.
2.  **Set Sample Data:** A Set node (`Edit Fields: Set JSON data to test`) defines a sample JSON object named `jsonData`. This object contains:
    * `reportTitle`: A title (not used in the chart generation in this example, but useful for context).
    * `labels`: An array of strings representing the labels for the chart's X-axis (e.g., ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"]).
    * `salesData`: An array of numbers representing the data points for the chart's Y-axis (e.g., [1250, 1800, 1550, 2100]).
3.  **Generate Chart:** The QuickChart node is configured to:
    * Create a `line` chart.
    * Dynamically read labels from the `jsonData.labels` array (`Labels Mode: From Array`).
    * Use the `jsonData.salesData` array as the input data (Note: This configuration places data in the top-level 'Data' field. For more complex charts with multiple datasets or specific dataset options, configure datasets under 'Dataset Options' instead).
    * The node outputs the generated chart image as binary data in a field named `data`.
4.  **Upload to Google Drive:** The Google Drive node (`Google Drive: Upload File`):
    * Takes the binary data (`data`) from the QuickChart node.
    * Uploads the image to your specified Google Drive folder.
    * Dynamically names the file based on its extension (e.g., `chart.png`).

## Setup Steps

1.  **Import:** Import this template into your n8n instance.
2.  **Configure Google Drive Credentials:**
    * Select the `Google Drive: Upload File` node.
    * You **MUST** configure your own Google Drive credentials. Click on the 'Credentials' dropdown and either select existing credentials or create new ones by following the authentication prompts.
3.  **(Optional) Customize Google Drive Folder:** In the `Google Drive: Upload File` node, you can change the `Drive ID` and `Folder ID` to specify exactly where the chart should be uploaded.
4.  **Activate:** Activate the workflow if you want it to run automatically based on a different trigger.

## How to Use & Customize

* **Change Input Data:** Modify the `labels` and `salesData` arrays within the `Edit Fields: Set JSON data to test` node to use your own data. Ensure the number of labels matches the number of data points.
* **Use Real Data Sources:** Replace the `Edit Fields: Set JSON data to test` node with nodes that fetch data from real sources like:
    * HTTP Request (APIs)
    * Postgres / MongoDB nodes (Databases)
    * Google Sheets node
    * Ensure the output data from your source node is formatted similarly (providing `labels` and `salesData` arrays). You might need another Set node to structure the data correctly before the QuickChart node.
* **Change Chart Type:** In the QuickChart node, modify the `Chart Type` parameter (e.g., change from `line` to `bar`, `pie`, `doughnut`, etc.).
* **Customize Chart Appearance:** Explore the `Chart Options` parameter within the QuickChart node to add titles, change colors, modify axes, etc., using QuickChart's standard JSON configuration options.
* **Use Datasets (Recommended for Complex Charts):** For multiple lines/bars or more control, configure datasets explicitly in the QuickChart node:
    * Remove the expression from the top-level `Data` field.
    * Go to `Dataset Options` -&gt; `Add option` -&gt; `Add dataset`.
    * Set the `Data` field within the dataset using an expression like `{{ $json.jsonData.salesData }}`.
    * You can add multiple datasets this way.
* **Change Output Destination:** Replace the `Google Drive: Upload File` node with other nodes to handle the chart image differently:
    * `Write Binary File`: Save the chart to the local filesystem where n8n is running.
    * `Slack` / `Discord` / `Telegram`: Send the chart to messaging platforms.
    * `Move Binary Data`: Convert the image to Base64 to embed in HTML or return via webhook response.
