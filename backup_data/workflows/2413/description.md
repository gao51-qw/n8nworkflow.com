## How it works
The **Notion Database Assistant** uses an AI Agent built with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) to query [this Knowledge Base style Notion database](https://30dayaisprint.notion.site/7ea9697d4875441eb2621105337d232e?v=cff6ba4cb0d14613b143af6f96dab287). The assistant can search across multiple properties like tags or question and retrieves content from inside individual Notion pages for additional context.

**Key features include:**

- Querying the database with flexible filters.
- Searching within individual Notion pages and extracting relevant blocks.
- Providing a reference link to the exact Notion pages used to inform its responses, ensuring transparency and easy verification.
- This assistant uses two HTTP request tools—one for querying the Notion database and another for pulling data from within specific pages. It streamlines knowledge retrieval, offering a conversational, AI-driven way to interact with large datasets.
