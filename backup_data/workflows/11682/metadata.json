  "description": "## How it works\nPlease send a corporate website URL via chat.\n\nThe AI will investigate the company website on your behalf and return the extracted company information.  \nSince this is set up as a conversational workflow, retrying or trying another URL is simple.\n\n## How to use\n* To get started, please set up the Credential in the `Gemini` node attached to the `AI Agent` node.\n  * You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).\n\nOnce configured, the workflow will run when you send a corporate website URL (e.g., https://example.com/) via chat.\n\n## Customizing this workflow\nYou can change the settings in the `Config` node.\n\n* You can modify `targetCompanyFields` to customize which company data fields are extracted.\n* You can modify `language` to receive the results in a language other than English.",
