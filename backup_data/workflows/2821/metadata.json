This step ensures you have a targeted list of potential buyers.\n\n### **4. Email Enrichment**  \nFor each extracted email, the workflow gathers publicly available information (e.g., LinkedIn, company websites) to enhance personalization.\n\n### **5. Personalized Email Creation**  \nBased on the enriched data, the workflow crafts a custom email for each lead, emphasizing the domain’s value, its relevance to their business, and a compelling call-to-action.\n\n### **6. Email Sending via Gmail**  \nThe workflow sends the personalized emails directly through your Gmail account, ensuring timely and professional outreach.\n\n### **7.
