## Who it's for
This **n8n workflow** automatically fetches RSS articles, extracts featured images, and publishes them across multiple social media platforms. The workflow runs on a schedule, processes news articles from an RSS feed, extracts the main image from each article, and posts the content with images to various platforms including WordPress, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn, and Discord.

## Features
* **Scheduled Publishing**: Auto-posts content on your set schedule
* **RSS Integration**: Fetches latest articles from specified sources

* **Image Optimization**: Downloads and resizes for platform-ready display
* **Multi-Platform Posting**: Supports WordPress, Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn, Discord

* **Content Validation**: Ensures valid images before posting

5. The content is published simultaneously to:
   - WordPress as a blog post with the image set as featured
   - Facebook as an image post
   - Telegram channel as an image post
   - LinkedIn (both personal profile and company page)
   - Discord channel
6. After successful publishing, notifications are sent to multiple channels
