  "description": "## Who's it for\nContent creators, social media managers, and marketing teams who want to automatically extract the most engaging clips from long-form YouTube videos and identify content with high viral potential.\n\n## What it does\nThis workflow analyzes any YouTube video using Vizard AI's clipping technology and automatically generates up to 8 short clips with viral score ratings. It then filters for the highest-scoring clips (9/10 or above) and posts them to a designated Slack channel for team review and distribution.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Video submission**: Enter a YouTube URL through a user-friendly form\n2. **AI analysis**: Submits the video to Vizard AI for automated clipping and viral score analysis\n3. **Smart polling**: Waits for processing completion and retrieves results\n4. **Quality filtering**: Only surfaces clips with viral scores of 9/10 or higher\n5. **Team notification**: Posts results to Slack with clip titles, scores, and download links\n\n## Requirements\n- Vizard AI API credentials (sign up at vizard.ai)\n- Slack workspace with OAuth app configured\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configure Vizard AI credentials**: Add your Vizard AI API key to the HTTP Request nodes\n2. **Set up Slack integration**: Configure the Slack OAuth2 credentials and select your target channel\n3. **Customize filtering**: Adjust the viral score threshold in the filter node (currently set to 9/10)\n4. **Test the workflow**: Submit a test YouTube URL to ensure everything works properly\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- **Adjust clip quantity**: Modify the `maxClipNumber` parameter (currently 8) in the initial API request\n- **Change viral score threshold**: Update the filter condition to match your quality standards\n- **Extend with automation**: Connect to social media posting tools or caption generation workflows for full automation\n- **Add scheduling**: Integrate with webhook triggers, scheduled triggers, or RSS feeds for batch processing videos",
