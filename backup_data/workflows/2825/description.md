![Spot Workplace Discrimination Patterns with AI.png](fileId:924)

## How It Works:
• Scrapes company review data from Glassdoor using ScrapingBee.
• Extracts demographic-based ratings using AI-powered text analysis.
• Calculates workplace disparities with statistical measures like z-scores, effect sizes, and p-values.
• Generates visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts) to highlight patterns of discrimination or bias.


### Example Visualizations:

## Set Up Steps:
*Estimated time: ~20 minutes.*
• Replace ScrapingBee and OpenAI credentials with your own.
• Input the company name you want to analyze (best results with large U.S.-based organizations).
• Run the workflow and review the AI-generated insights and visual reports.

This workflow empowers users to identify potential workplace discrimination trends, helping advocate for greater equity and accountability.
