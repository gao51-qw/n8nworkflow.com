  "description": "![workflow.png](fileId:1280)\nThis n8n template demonstrates how to download multiple PDF files from public URLs and merge them into a single PDF using the PDF Toolkit from www.customjs.space.\n\n[@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit)\n\n### Notice\n\nCommunity nodes can only be installed on self-hosted instances of n8n.\n\n### What this workflow does\n\n- **Downloads** each PDF using an HTTP Request.\n- **Populates** files into an array with **Merge** node from n8n.\n- **Merges** all downloaded PDFs using the Merge PDF node from the @custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit.\n- **Writes** the final merged PDF to disk.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Self-hosted** n8n instance\n- **CustomJS API key** for merging multiple PDF files.\n- **PDF files to be merged** to be converted into a PDF\n\n### Workflow Steps:\n\n1. **Manual Trigger**:\n\n   - Runs with user interaction.\n\n2. **HTTP Request Node For PDF Download**:\n\n   - Pass urls for PDF files to merge.\n\n3. **Merge Node For Array Population**:\n\n   - Just populates two files into an array.\n\n4. **Merge PDF files**:\n   - Uses the **CustomJS** node to merge the incoming PDF files into a single PDF file.\n   - If size of PDF files exceeds 6MB, you can simply pass an array of URLs for PDF files.\n\n---\n\n### Usage\n\n### Get API key from [customJS](https://www.customjs.space)\n\n- Sign up to customJS platform.\n- Navigate to your profile page\n- Press \"Show\" button to get API key\n![1.png](fileId:1281) \n\n### Set Credentials for CustomJS API on n8n\n\nCopy and paste your API key generated from CustomJS here.\n![2.png](fileId:1279)\n\n### Design workflow\n\n- A Manual Trigger for starting workflow.\n- Two HTTP Request Nodes for downloading PDF files.\n- A Merge Node for populating files as an array.\n- Merge PDFs node for merging files\n- Write to Disk node for saving merged PDF file.\n\nYou can replace logic for triggering and returning results.\nFor example, you can trigger this workflow by calling a webhook and get a result as a response from webhook. Simply replace Manual Trigger and Write to Disk nodes.\n\n### Perfect for\n\n- Bundling reports or invoices.\n- Generating document sets from external sources.\n- Automating PDF handling without writing custom code\n",
