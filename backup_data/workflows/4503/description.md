🚀 Product Overview
This n8n workflow template automates the entire lifecycle of RSS feed monitoring—perfect for tech news aggregation, content curation, and AI-powered updates. It reads RSS links from a Google Sheets file, fetches content, summarizes it using GPT, sends digest messages to Discord, and stores clean content into a Google Sheets database for future use.
