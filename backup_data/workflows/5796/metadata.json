  "description": "## 🧾 What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow automatically generates avatar-style videos from the latest AI-related news using Dumpling AI and HeyGen. It runs every hour, scrapes trending articles, turns them into 30–60 second spoken scripts with GPT-4o, and produces short avatar videos with HeyGen. Finally, it logs the final video URL in a Google Sheet.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n\n- Newsletters and creators who want to automate AI trend updates  \n- Content marketers generating short-form video content  \n- Product teams experimenting with AI-generated summaries  \n- Automation enthusiasts combining LLMs + video + trending data  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How to set up\n\n### 🔐 Requirements\n- **Dumpling AI API Key** stored securely as HTTP Header credential  \n- **HeyGen API Key** added as an HTTP Header credential  \n- **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-4o (can use GPT-4o-mini if preferred)  \n- **Google Sheets account** with one column: `Video link`  \n\n### 🛠 Step-by-step setup\n\n1. **Google Sheet Setup**  \n   - Create a Google Sheet with a single column named: `Video link`\n\n2. **Update Credentials**  \n   - Use n8n’s credential manager to add tokens for:  \n     - Dumpling AI  \n     - HeyGen  \n     - OpenAI  \n     - Google Sheets\n\n3. **Optional Customizations**\n   - In the \"Dumpling AI: Search AI News\" node, you can change `\"query\": \"AI Agent\"`  \n     to other trending keywords (e.g., `\"Generative AI\"`, `\"Autonomous Agents\"`, etc.)\n   - Update the `avatar_id` and `voice_id` in the HeyGen request to match your preferred look/sound\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it works\n\n1. The Schedule Trigger runs hourly.  \n2. Dumpling AI searches for fresh news related to \"AI Agent.\"  \n3. The top 4 news links are scraped for full content.  \n4. Articles are merged and fed into GPT-4o via a LangChain Agent to produce a casual, conversational video script.  \n5. HeyGen creates a video using the script, avatar, and voice.  \n6. The workflow waits until the video rendering is complete.  \n7. Once done, the final video link is logged into Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Customization Ideas\n\n- Change the interval (e.g., every 6 hours, daily)\n- Swap avatar/voice in HeyGen to fit your brand\n- Expand to post the video directly to social media\n- Add image background or B-roll overlays using Creatomate\n\n\n---\n\nThis is a fast, automated pipeline to create explainer-style AI news updates using real-time data and generative video tools.\n",
