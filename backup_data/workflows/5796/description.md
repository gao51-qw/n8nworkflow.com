## 🧾 What this workflow does

This workflow automatically generates avatar-style videos from the latest AI-related news using Dumpling AI and HeyGen. It runs every hour, scrapes trending articles, turns them into 30–60 second spoken scripts with GPT-4o, and produces short avatar videos with HeyGen. Finally, it logs the final video URL in a Google Sheet.

## ⚙️ How to set up

### 🔐 Requirements
- **Dumpling AI API Key** stored securely as HTTP Header credential  
- **HeyGen API Key** added as an HTTP Header credential  
- **OpenAI API Key** for GPT-4o (can use GPT-4o-mini if preferred)  
- **Google Sheets account** with one column: `Video link`  

### 🛠 Step-by-step setup

1. **Google Sheet Setup**  
   - Create a Google Sheet with a single column named: `Video link`

2. **Update Credentials**  
   - Use n8n’s credential manager to add tokens for:  
     - Dumpling AI  
     - HeyGen  
     - OpenAI  
     - Google Sheets

3. **Optional Customizations**
   - In the "Dumpling AI: Search AI News" node, you can change `"query": "AI Agent"`  
     to other trending keywords (e.g., `"Generative AI"`, `"Autonomous Agents"`, etc.)
   - Update the `avatar_id` and `voice_id` in the HeyGen request to match your preferred look/sound

## 🧠 How it works

1. The Schedule Trigger runs hourly.  
2. Dumpling AI searches for fresh news related to "AI Agent."  
3. The top 4 news links are scraped for full content.  
4. Articles are merged and fed into GPT-4o via a LangChain Agent to produce a casual, conversational video script.  
5. HeyGen creates a video using the script, avatar, and voice.  
6. The workflow waits until the video rendering is complete.  
7. Once done, the final video link is logged into Google Sheets.

## 🧪 Customization Ideas

- Change the interval (e.g., every 6 hours, daily)
- Swap avatar/voice in HeyGen to fit your brand
- Expand to post the video directly to social media
- Add image background or B-roll overlays using Creatomate
