  "description": "\n# ⚡ Next-Gen Customer Support: Two-Way WhatsApp + Telegram Integration for 10k+ Clients\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Who is this workflow for\n\nThis workflow is designed for **customer support teams, e-commerce\nfounders, and operations managers** who want to handle thousands of\ncustomer queries seamlessly. Instead of building a brand-new chat\napplication, it leverages **WhatsApp (where customers already are)** and\n**Telegram (where your support team operates)** to create a scalable,\ntopic-based support system.\n\nIf you are a brand handling 1000s of daily WhatsApp customer messages\nand need a structured way to map each customer into a dedicated support\nthread without chaos, this workflow is for you.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What it does / How it works\n\nThis **two-way n8n automation** bridges WhatsApp and Telegram by\ncreating **one Telegram forum topic per customer** and syncing messages\nboth ways:\n\n1.  **Incoming WhatsApp → Telegram**\n    -   When a new WhatsApp message arrives, the workflow checks if the\n        customer already has a topic in Telegram.\n    -   If yes → The message is forwarded into that existing topic.\n    -   If no → A new topic is created automatically, the mapping is\n        saved in the database, and the message is posted there.\n    -   Result: every customer has a dedicated thread in your Telegram\n        supergroup.\n2.  **Outgoing Telegram → WhatsApp**\n    -   When a support agent replies in a Telegram topic, the workflow\n        looks up the linked WhatsApp number.\n    -   The reply is sent back to the customer on WhatsApp, preserving\n        context.\n    -   Result: two-way synced conversations without building a custom\n        app.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## How to set it up\n\n1.  **Configure WhatsApp Cloud API**\n    -   Create a Meta Developer account and register a WhatsApp Business\n        number.\n    -   Generate an access token and phone number ID.\n2.  **Configure Telegram Bot**\n    -   Use BotFather to create a bot and enable it in a **Telegram\n        Supergroup with Topics**.\n    -   Get the `chat_id` and allow the bot to create/send messages in\n        topics.\n3.  **Database (Supabase/Postgres)**\n    -   Create a table `wa_tg_threads` to map `phone_e164` ↔\n        `telegram_topic_id` ↔ `supergroup_id`.\n4.  **n8n Workflows**\n    -   Workflow A: WhatsApp → Telegram\n        -   Trigger: WhatsApp Webhook\n        -   Steps: Lookup customer → If exists send to topic, else\n            create topic → Save mapping → Forward message.\n    -   Workflow B: Telegram → WhatsApp\n        -   Trigger: Telegram Webhook\n        -   Steps: Filter only topic replies → Lookup mapping → Send\n            WhatsApp message.\n5.  **Testing**\n    -   Send a WhatsApp message → Check Telegram topic created.\n    -   Reply in Telegram topic → Ensure customer receives WhatsApp\n        reply.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Requirements\n\n-   A free or paid **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud).\n-   **WhatsApp Cloud API credentials** (phone number ID + access\n    token).\n-   **Telegram Bot token** with access to a **Supergroup with Topics**\n    enabled.\n-   A **Postgres/Supabase database** to store thread mappings.\n-   Basic familiarity with editing HTTP Request nodes in n8n.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n-   **Brand personalization:** Pre-populate first message templates\n    (thank you, order status, delivery updates).\n-   **Routing rules:** Assign specific agents to certain topics by ID\n    ranges.\n-   **Integrations:** Extend to CRMs (HubSpot, Zoho) or support\n    platforms (Freshdesk, Zendesk).\n-   **Notifications:** Push high-priority WhatsApp queries into\n    Slack/Teams for instant alerts.\n-   **Archival:** Auto-close inactive topics after N days and mark\n    customers as dormant.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why Telegram instead of building a new App\n\nThe client's requirement was clear: **use an existing, reliable, and\nscalable chat platform** instead of building a new app from scratch.\n\n-   **Telegram Supergroups with Topics** scale to 100,000+ members and\n    millions of messages, making them ideal for managing 10k+ customer\n    threads.\n-   Agents don't need to install or learn a new tool---they continue\n    inside Telegram, which is fast, free, and mobile-friendly.\n-   Building a custom chat app would require authentication, push\n    notifications, scaling infra, and UX---all solved instantly by\n    Telegram.\n\nThis decision **saves development cost, accelerates deployment, and\nprovides proven scalability**.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Why this improves support productivity\n\n-   **Organized by customer:** Each WhatsApp number has its own Telegram\n    topic.\n-   **No missed messages:** Agents can quickly scroll topics without\n    drowning in one endless chat.\n-   **Two-way sync:** Replies flow back to WhatsApp seamlessly.\n-   **Scales automatically:** Handle 10k+ conversations without losing\n    track.\n-   **Leverages existing tools:** WhatsApp (customers) + Telegram\n    (agents).\n\nResult: **faster responses, better tracking, and zero need to reinvent\nchat software.**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n",
