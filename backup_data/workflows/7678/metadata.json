You can copy and use it directly.\n\n**Overview**\nThis is a powerful n8n \"meta-workflow\" that acts as a Supervisor. Through a simple Telegram bot, you can dynamically create, manage, and delete countless independent, AI-driven market monitoring agents (Watchdogs).\n\nThis template is a perfect implementation of the \"Workflowception\" (workflow managing workflows) concept in n8n, showcasing how to achieve ultimate automation by leveraging the the n8n API.\n\n**How It Works ?**\nTelegram Bot Interface:\nExecute all operations by sending commands to your own Telegram Bot:\n\n```\n/add SYMBOL INTERVAL PROMPT: Add a new monitoring task.\n\n/delete SYMBOL: Delete an existing monitoring task.\n\n/list: List all currently running monitoring tasks.\n\n/help: Get help information.\n```\nUse Telegram Bot to control\n![image.png](fileId:2166)\n\nThe watchdog workfolw created in the below\n![image.png](fileId:2167)\n\n**Dynamic Workflow Management:**\nUpon receiving an /add command, the Supervisor system reads a \"Watchdog\" template, fills in your provided parameters (like trading pair and time interval), and then automatically creates a brand new, independent workflow via the n8n API and activates it.\n\n**Persistent Storage:**\nAll monitoring tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring your configurations are safe even if n8n restarts. The ID of each newly created workflow is also written back to the database to facilitate future deletion operations.\n\n**AI-Powered Analysis:**\nEach created \"Watchdog\" workflow runs on schedule. It fetches the latest candlestick chart by calling a self-hosted `tradingview-snapshot` service. This service, available at `https://github.com/0xcathiefish/tradingview-snapshot`, works by simulating a login to your account and then using TradingView's official snapshot feature to generate an unrestricted, high-quality chart image. An example of a generated snapshot can be seen here: `https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uvxylM1Z.png`.\n\nTo use this, you need to download the Docker image from the packages in the GitHub repository mentioned above, and run it as a container. The n8n workflow then communicates directly with this container via an HTTP API to request and receive the chart snapshot.\n\nAfter obtaining the image, the workflow calls a multimodal AI model (Gemini). It sends both the chart image and your custom text-based conditions (e.g., \"breakout above previous high on high volume\" or \"break below 4-hour MA20\") to the AI for analysis, enabling truly intelligent chart interpretation and alert triggering.\n\n**Key Features**\nWorkflowception: A prime example of one workflow using an API to create, activate, and delete other workflows.\n\nFull Control via Telegram: Manage your monitoring bots from anywhere, anytime, without needing to log into the n8n interface.\n\nAI Visual Analysis: Move beyond simple price alerts. Let an AI \"read\" the charts for you to enable complex, pattern-based, and indicator-based intelligent alerts.\n\nPersistent & Extensible: Built on PostgreSQL for stability and reliability. You can easily add more custom commands.",
