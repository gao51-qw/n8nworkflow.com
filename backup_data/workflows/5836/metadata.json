  "title": "Create an offline DIGIPIN microservice API for precise location mapping in India",
  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n**What is DIGIPIN?**\nDIGIPIN (Digital Pincode) is a 10-character alphanumeric code introduced by India Post. It maps any 3x3 meter square in India to a unique digital address. This helps precisely locate homes, shops, or landmarks, especially in areas where physical addresses are inconsistent or missing.\n\n**What this workflow does**\nThis workflow creates a fully offline DIGIPIN microservice using only JavaScript - no external APIs are used.\n\nYou get two HTTP endpoints:\n- GET /generate-digipin?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude} → returns a DIGIPIN\n- GET /decode-digipin?digipin={code} → returns the latitude and longitude\n\nYou can plug this into any system to:\n- Convert GPS coordinates to a DIGIPIN\n- Convert a DIGIPIN back to coordinates\n\n**How it works**\n1. An HTTP Webhook node receives the request\n2. A JS Function node either encodes or decodes based on input\n3. The result is returned as a JSON response\n\nAll the logic is handled inside the workflow - no API keys, no external calls.\n\n**Why use this**\n- Fast and lightweight\n- Easily extendable: you can connect this to forms, CRMs, apps, or spreadsheets\n- Ideal for field agents, address validation, logistics, or rural operations",
