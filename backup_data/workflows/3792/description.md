## Step-by-Step Workflow Explanation

### 🗓 1. **Scheduled Trigger (Support Workflow)**
- Marks all rows in the sheet as `"notchecked"` in the `checkstatus` column.
- This is the user-defined frequency trigger (e.g. weekly, daily).
- Triggers the main workflow.

### 🚀 2. **Main Workflow Trigger**
- Starts when a row with `checkstatus = notchecked` is found.

### 🔍 3. **HTTP Node (SerpAPI Call)**
- Sends a request to SerpAPI for each keyword.
- Fetches the current Google SERP for that keyword.

### 🧠 4. **JavaScript Node (Parse Position)**
- Loops through the SERP results and finds the position of the target URL.
- Extracts and returns the current rank.

### ✍️ 5. **Google Sheets Node (Update Data)**
- Writes the new ranking into the spreadsheet.
- Updates the `currentposition` and sets `checkstatus` to `"checked"`.

### 🔀 6. **Switch Node (Compare Rankings)**
- Compares `previousposition` with `currentposition`:
  - If rank has improved → send positive alert.
  - If rank has dropped → send negative alert.
  - If unchanged → no alert.

### 📩 7. **Notification Nodes (WhatsApp / Email)**
- Sends a message to chosen channels when a change is detected.

## Customization Guide

### 🌐 Expand Search Engine Targets
- SerpAPI also supports other search engines like Bing and Yahoo. Modify the request params to switch.

## How to Set Up This Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Use This Google Sheets Template
To get started quickly, **make a copy** of the template below:

👉 [Google Sheets Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mWXr7qonRLOtNYU8cPYr-PXTNLh6vFasu5L_iAjvdQ0/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

This template includes the required structure:
- `keyword`
- `Website_url`
- `position`
- `timestamp`
- `checkstatus`

&gt; ⚠️ Be sure to make your own copy to edit and connect via the Google Sheets node.

---

### 🔐 Step 2: Configure Your APIs
- **SerpAPI:** Get API key from [serpapi.com/manage-api-key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key)
  - Set credential type to `Generic` in n8n for compatibility.
- **Google Sheets, Email & WhatsApp:** Use the instructions found in each node’s **Docs tab** to connect your accounts.

---

### 📦 Step 3: Import the Workflow
- Both the **main keyword tracking workflow** and the **supporting scheduler workflow** are in one file

---

### ▶️ Step 4: The workflow will start
- Since the check status columns will be 'notChecked' **schedule workflow**.
- The update sheets node will update each processed row's checkstatus to 'checked' and the workflow will process the next row
- the schedule trigger workflow will update `checkstatus = notchecked` and triggers the keyword tracking automatically.

---

### 🎉 Done!
