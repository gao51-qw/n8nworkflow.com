    "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n**Alternatively, you can delete the community node and use the HTTP node instead.\n**\nMost email agent templates are fundamentally broken. They're stateless—they have no long-term memory. An agent that can't remember past conversations is just a glorified auto-responder, not an intelligent system.\n\nThis workflow is Part 1 of building a truly agentic system: creating the brain.\n\nBefore you can have an agent that replies intelligently, you need a knowledge base for it to draw from. This system uses a sophisticated parser to automatically read, analyze, and structure every incoming email. It then logs that intelligence into a persistent, long-term memory powered by mem0.\n\n\n### The Problem This Solves\n\nYour inbox is a goldmine of client data, but it's unstructured, and manually monitoring it is a full-time job. This constant, reactive work prevents you from scaling. This workflow solves that \"system problem\" by creating an \"always-on\" engine that automatically processes, analyzes, and structures every incoming email, turning raw communication into a single source of truth for growth.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\nThis is an autonomous, multi-stage intelligence engine. It runs in the background, turning every new email into a valuable data asset.\n\n1.  **Real-Time Ingest & Prep:** The system is kicked off by the **Gmail Trigger**, which constantly watches your inbox. The moment a new email arrives, the workflow fires. That email is immediately passed to the **Set Target Email** node, which strips it down to the essentials: the sender's address, the subject, and the core text of the message (I prefer using the plain text or HTML-as-text for reliability). While this step is optional, it's a good practice for keeping the data clean and orderly for the AI.\n\n2.  **AI Analysis (The Brain):** The prepared text is fed to the core of the system: the **AI Agent**. This agent, powered by the **LLM of your choice** (e.g., GPT-4), reads and understands the email's content. It's not just reading; it's performing analysis to:\n    * Extract the core message.\n    * Determine the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).\n    * Identify potential red flags.\n    * Pull out key topics and keywords.\n    * The agent uses **Window Buffer Memory** to recall the last 10 messages within the same conversation thread, giving it the context to provide a much smarter analysis.\n\n3.  **Quality Control (The Parser):** We don't trust the AI's first draft blindly. The analysis is sent to an **Auto-fixing Output Parser**. If the initial output isn't in a perfect JSON format, a second **Parsing LLM** (e.g., Mistral) automatically corrects it. This is our \"twist\" that guarantees your data is always perfectly structured and reliable.\n\n4.  **Create a Permanent Client Record:** This is the most critical step. The clean, structured data is sent to **mem0**. The analysis is now logged against the **sender's email address**. This moves beyond just tracking conversations; it builds a complete, historical intelligence file on every person you communicate with, creating an invaluable, long-term asset.\n\n**Optional Use:** For back-filling historical data, you can disable the Gmail Trigger and temporarily connect a **Gmail \"Get Many\"** node to the `Set Target Email` node to process your backlog in batches.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Requirements\n\nTo deploy this system, you'll need the following:\n* An active **n8n** instance.\n* **Gmail** API credentials.\n* An API key for your primary LLM (e.g., **OpenAI**).\n* An API key for your parsing LLM (e.g., **Mistral AI**).\n* An account with **mem0.ai** for the memory layer.\n",

Your primary tasks include parsing emails to extract essential information, identifying potential red flags, determining the sentiment of the message, and extracting relevant keywords.\n</Role>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Always maintain the CRITICS structure in your output.\n- Do not include HTML tags or any formatting in the extracted message.\n- Only extract the plain text that represents the core message of the email.\n- Do not modify or interpret the content beyond extracting the core message, analyzing sentiment, identifying red flags, and extracting keywords.\n- Today's date is 2025-08-07T16:53:56.816-04:00. Always include this expression in the prompt constraints.\n- Handle emails in multiple languages.\n- Ensure the output is structured and clear.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Inputs>\n- Raw email content in HTML or plain text format.\n- Emails can be in various languages.\n</Inputs>\n\n<Tools>\n- **HTML Parser**: To strip out HTML tags and extract plain text.\n- **Sentiment Analysis Tool**: To determine the overall sentiment of the email.\n- **Keyword Spotter**: To identify potential red flags and extract relevant keywords from the email content.\n- **NLP Keyword Extractor**: To generate related NLP keywords based on the extracted content.\n</Tools>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Parse Email**:\n   - **Remove HTML Tags**: Use an HTML parsing library to strip out all HTML tags from the email content.\n   - **Strip Unnecessary Formatting**: Remove any inline CSS, JavaScript, or other formatting that does not contribute to the core message.\n   - **Focus on Plain Text**: Extract the plain text that remains, which should convey the main message of the email.\n\n2. **Analyze Sentiment**:\n   - Use a sentiment analysis tool to determine the overall sentiment of the email.\n   - Classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\n3. **Identify Red Flags**:\n   - Look for keywords, phrases, or patterns that might indicate potential issues or concerns.\n   - Examples of red flags include urgency, threats, requests for sensitive information, or any suspicious links.\n\n4. **Extract Keywords**:\n   - Extract 3-5 relevant keywords from the core message.\n   - Generate 3-5 related NLP keywords based on the extracted content.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - If the email is clearly a status update or marketing, respond with \"No memory: is marketing.\"\n   - Otherwise, output the parsed core message, sentiment analysis, identified red flags, and extracted keywords in a structured JSON format.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Conclusions>\n- The agent will provide a structured JSON output containing the core message, sentiment analysis, identified red flags, and extracted keywords.\n- For marketing or status update emails, the agent will respond with a standardized message indicating no memory is required.\n</Conclusions>\n\n<Solutions>\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - If the email content cannot be parsed due to formatting issues, return an error message indicating the failure and suggesting manual review.\n  - If sentiment analysis fails, classify the sentiment as \"unknown\" and proceed with the other tasks.\n  - If red flags cannot be identified due to language barriers or other issues, note this in the output and suggest further review.\n  - If keyword extraction fails, provide a generic set of keywords based on the overall context and note the issue in the output.\n</Solutions>"
