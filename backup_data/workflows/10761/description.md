## How It Works
Scheduled triggers initiate automated contract reviews. The system fetches documents from cloud storage and email, then uses AI to extract key terms, obligations, and compliance requirements. Multi-model parsing identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and potential risks. A scoring engine evaluates severity and routes alerts to the appropriate channels. The workflow then updates the CLM system and produces audit-ready documentation for tracking and governance.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Storage:** Configure access to your Google Drive or webhook-based document repository.
2. **Email:** Connect Gmail to automatically ingest contract-related emails.
3. **AI Extraction:** Add the OpenAI API key and define extraction prompts for obligations and terms.
4. **CLM System:** Enter credentials for your contract lifecycle management platform.
5. **Alerts:** Set up Google Sheets logging and connect dashboard endpoints for risk and compliance alerts.
