# 👔 Recruitment Office WhatsApp Automation

Automate WhatsApp communication for recruitment agencies with an interactive, structured customer experience. This workflow handles pricing inquiries, request submissions, tracking, complaints, and human escalation while maintaining full session tracking and media support.

## Good to know

- Uses WhatsApp Interactive List Messages for user selection and navigation.
- Includes session-state logic and memory across messages.
- Includes a 5-minute cooldown to avoid spam and repeated triggers.
- Supports logging for all interaction types including media files.
- Includes both a global bot shutdown switch and per-user override.

## How it works

- A customer sends a message to the official WhatsApp number.
- The workflow replies with an interactive menu containing 8 service options:
  - 💰 Pricing by nationality (8 supported countries)
  - 📝 New recruitment request submission
  - 🔍 Tracking existing applications via Google Sheets lookup
  - 🔁 Worker transfer link distribution
  - 🌍 Translation service information
  - 📄 Required documents and instructions
  - ⚠️ Complaint submission and routing
  - 👤 Request a human agent
- The workflow retrieves or stores data based on the selection using Google Sheets and Data Tables.
- If the customer requests human help or the logic detects uncertainty, the workflow:
  - Pauses automation for that user
  - Notifies a designated staff member
- All interactions are logged including files, text, timestamps, and selections.
