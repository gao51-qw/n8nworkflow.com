  "description": "# What It Is\n\n  An automated workflow for auditing website security headers and generating\n  comprehensive security reports.\n\n  The workflow consists of three main phases:\n\n  1. Perform Security Scan\n  2. Save Results in Table\n  3. Email Report\n\n  ---\n## Perform Security Scan\n\n  This phase analyzes a website's security headers and generates a security grade.\n\n###  Form Input\n\n  A form trigger collects user inputs:\n\n  - Site: The website URL to audit (e.g., example.com)\n  - Report Recipient: Email address to receive the security report\n\n###  URL List & Fetch Headers\n\n  - Prepares the URL for analysis and timestamps the audit\n  - Sends an HTTP HEAD request to retrieve security headers\n  - Timeout set to 10 seconds for reliable results\n\n###  Parse Headers & Security Scorer\n\n  - Extracts and normalizes HTTP headers for analysis\n  - Evaluates 7 critical security headers:\n    - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - HTTPS enforcement\n    - Content-Security-Policy (CSP) - XSS protection\n    - X-Frame-Options - Clickjacking prevention\n    - X-Content-Type-Options - MIME sniffing protection\n    - Referrer-Policy - Information leakage control\n    - Permissions-Policy - Feature access control\n    - Cache-Control - Authentication page caching\n\n###  Grade Calculator\n\n  - Calculates security score (0-70 points) and assigns letter grade (A-F)\n  - Identifies missing headers and configuration issues\n  - Flags critical security vulnerabilities\n\n  ---\n##  Save Results in Table\n\n  This phase exports audit results to a structured Google Sheets database.\n\n###  Format Report\n\n  - Structures audit data for spreadsheet export\n  - Creates checkmark/X indicators for header presence\n  - Summarizes issues and security recommendations\n\n###  Export to Sheets\n\n  - Appends results to Google Sheets for tracking trends\n  - Includes timestamp, URL, grade, scores, and detailed findings\n  - Supports historical analysis and compliance reporting\n\n  ---\n##  Email Report\n\n  This phase generates AI-powered remediation instructions and sends detailed\n  security reports.\n\n###  AI Remediation Agent\n\n  - Uses AI to create copy-paste instructions for non-technical users\n  - Generates platform-specific implementation guidance\n  - Provides step-by-step remediation for AI code editors (GitHub Copilot, Cursor,\n  etc.)\n\n###  Email Formatting & Delivery\n\n  - Creates visually rich HTML email reports with:\n    - Security grade and score breakdown\n    - Missing headers analysis\n    - Configuration warnings\n    - AI-generated remediation instructions\n    - Implementation checklist\n  - Sends comprehensive report via Gmail\n\n  ---\n#  Setup\n\n  To run this workflow, configure the following credentials in n8n:\n\n###  OpenRouter\n\n  - Generate an API key from your OpenRouter account for AI remediation features\n\n###  Google Sheets\n\n  - Uses OAuth 2.0 authentication\n  - Create a spreadsheet for audit results storage\n  - Update the spreadsheet ID in 'Export to Sheets' node\n\n###  Gmail OAuth2\n\n  - Configure Gmail credentials for automated report delivery\n  - Authenticate with your Google account",
