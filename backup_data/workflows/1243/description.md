This workflow demonstrates the use of the Split In Batches node and the Wait node to avoid API rate limits.

**Customer Datastore node:** The workflow fetches data from the Customer Datastore node. Based on your use case, replace it with a relevant node.

**Split In Batches node:** This node splits the items into a single item. Based on the API limit, you can configure the Batch Size.

**HTTP Request node:** This node makes API calls to a placeholder URL. If the Split In Batches node returns 5 items, the HTTP Request node will make 5 different API calls.

**Wait node:** This node will pause the workflow for the time you specify. On resume, the Split In Batches node gets executed node, and the next batch is processed.

**Replace Me (NoOp node):** This node is optional. If you want to continue your workflow and process the items, replace this node with the corresponding node(s).
