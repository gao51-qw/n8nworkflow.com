  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nMarketing, growth, and automation teams that need to ship polished bilingual newsletters—complete with images, optional video, and multi-channel distribution—without writing a line of code.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. A **Webhook** receives a plain-language request (e.g. “Create a newsletter about XYZ and store it in SharePoint”). The **Webhook** can be changed to another trigger, fr example **Manual Trigger**.\n2. An **AI Agent** (OpenAI GPT-4o) drafts German & English newsletter copy following a strict JSON schema.  \n3. **SharePoint** fetches an HTML template; a **Code** node injects AI copy into the placeholders.  \n4. Optional creative assets:  \n   - **Pollinations AI** → image (resolution check & frame overlay)  \n   - **FAL AI** → short video + Lyria2 audio → merged via FFmpeg API  \n5. A **Gmail Approval** step sends the draft to an approver; the flow continues only on “Approve”.  \n6. Depending on user intent the workflow:  \n   - Emails the newsletter to **HubSpot** contacts, and/or  \n   - Saves HTML (+ JPG/Video URL) to a **SharePoint** library.  \n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import the template\n2. Open the yellow sticky note and follow the checklist \n   - Create credentials for OpenAI, HubSpot (App Token), Microsoft 365, Gmail, and FAL AI.  \n   - Enter them in n8n Credential Manager (never in the HTTP node).  \n3. Edit the **Configuration Settings** Set node with your ENV_* variables.   \n4. Activate the workflow, copy the production Webhook URL, and trigger it with JSON body `{ \"text\": \"…\" }` or with a desired trigger.\n\n## Requirements  \n- OpenAI account\n- Microsoft 365 tenant (SharePoint & Outlook)  \n- HubSpot App Token  \n- FAL AI API Key (video & audio generation)  \n\n## How to customize  \n- Want a different language? Tweak the AI prompt inside **AI Agent**.  \n- Want a different storage provider? Change the SharePoint nodes to Google Drive or Dropbox.\n- Skip video generation: set `include_video` to `false` in the incoming prompt.  \n- Change the distribution logic by adjusting the **WF Result** Switch node.  \n- Add more channels (e.g. Slack) by inserting additional branches after the Switch and modifying the intent determination at the beginning of the workflow.\n",
