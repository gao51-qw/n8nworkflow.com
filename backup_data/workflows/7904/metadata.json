  "description": "---\n\n**Use cases are many:** Let users book, check, reschedule, or cancel meetings directly from Telegram. Perfect for solopreneurs, agencies, or teams who want an AI-powered assistant that prevents double-bookings, manages Google Calendar, and even sends email invites automatically.\n\n---\n\n**Good to know**\nAt time of writing, this workflow uses **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini** for natural conversation handling. See [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for updated info.\nThis workflow relies on **Google Calendar** for scheduling — if the model says “conflict found,” it means an event already exists in that time slot.\n\n---\n\n**How it works**\n\n* **Telegram Chat**: A user types natural requests like “Book a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 2 PM” or “Do I have meetings on Friday?”.\n* **AI Agent (OpenAI)**: Interprets the request, calculates dates (using Date & Time), and decides whether to create, update, or delete a meeting.\n* **Conflict Checking**: Before booking, the agent checks Google Calendar for existing events to avoid overlaps.\n* **Meeting Management**:\n\n  * **Create**: Adds new events with title, description, attendees.\n  * **Update**: Edits existing events.\n  * **Delete**: Cancels meetings if requested.\n  * **Get**: Lists all meetings for a date or time range.\n* **Notifications**: Replies instantly on Telegram and, if needed, sends a Gmail email with meeting details.\n* **Memory**: Keeps context of the conversation so users can speak naturally (“reschedule that meeting to 4 PM instead”).\n\n---\n\n**How to use**\n\n* Start a Telegram chat with the bot.\n* Type a request in plain English (no need for structured inputs).\n* The agent will confirm or suggest alternatives if a conflict exists.\n* Meetings appear in Google Calendar and details can be emailed via Gmail.\n\n---\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Telegram bot connected to n8n\n* OpenAI API key (for AI-driven scheduling assistant)\n* Google Calendar account (for event creation & conflict checking)\n* Gmail account (for sending invites & confirmations)\n\n---\n\n**Customising this workflow**\n\n* Add support for multiple calendars (work, personal, shared).\n* Change the conflict-resolution logic (e.g., auto-suggest nearest free slot).\n* Include recurring meetings (weekly standups, monthly reviews).\n* Add Slack or WhatsApp integration for multi-platform scheduling.\n* Extend Gmail invites with calendar attachments (.ics files).\n\n---\n\n👉 [Rakin Jakaria](https://www.youtube.com/@RakinJakaria)",
