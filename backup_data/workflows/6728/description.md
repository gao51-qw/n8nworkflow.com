# AI Conference Intelligence & Networking Optimizer with ScrapeGraphAI

&gt; **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This template requires a self-hosted n8n instance with ScrapeGraphAI integration. It cannot be used with n8n Cloud due to web scraping capabilities.**

![Conference Intelligence Workflow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/4A90E2/FFFFFF?text=Conference+Intelligence+Workflow+Preview)

This workflow automatically discovers industry conferences and provides AI-powered networking intelligence to maximize your event ROI.

## How it works

This workflow automatically discovers industry conferences and provides AI-powered networking intelligence to maximize your event ROI.

## Key Steps

1. **Scheduled Discovery** - Runs weekly to find new industry conferences from Eventbrite and other sources.
2. **AI-Powered Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract comprehensive conference information including speakers, agenda, and networking opportunities.
3. **Speaker Intelligence** - Analyzes speakers to identify high-priority networking targets based on their role, company, and expertise.
4. **Agenda Analysis** - Extracts and maps the complete conference schedule to optimize your time and networking strategy.
5. **Networking Strategy** - Generates AI-powered recommendations for maximizing networking ROI with prioritized contact lists and approach strategies.

## Set up steps

**Setup time: 10-15 minutes**

1. **Configure ScrapeGraphAI credentials** - Add your ScrapeGraphAI API key for web scraping capabilities.
2. **Customize conference sources** - Update the Eventbrite URL to target specific industries or locations.
3. **Adjust monitoring frequency** - Modify the weekly trigger to match your conference discovery needs.
4. **Review networking priorities** - The system automatically prioritizes speakers, but you can customize the criteria.

## Technical Configuration

### Prerequisites
- Self-hosted n8n instance (version 1.0+)
- ScrapeGraphAI API credentials
- Eventbrite API access (optional, for enhanced data)

### API Configuration
```bash
# ScrapeGraphAI Setup
1. Sign up at https://scrapegraph.ai
2. Generate API key from dashboard
3. Add credentials in n8n: Settings &gt; Credentials &gt; Add Credential &gt; ScrapeGraphAI
```

### Customization Examples

**Modify Conference Sources:**
```javascript
// In Eventbrite Scraper node, update the URL:
const targetUrl = "https://www.eventbrite.com/d/united-states/technology/";
const industryFilter = "?q=artificial+intelligence";
```

**Adjust Networking Priorities:**
```javascript
// In Speaker Intelligence node, modify scoring weights:
const priorityWeights = {
  executive_level: 0.4,
  company_size: 0.3,
  industry_relevance: 0.2,
  speaking_topic: 0.1
};
```

**Customize Output Format:**
```javascript
// In Networking Strategy node, modify output structure:
const outputFormat = {
  high_priority: speakers.filter(s =&gt; s.score &gt; 8),
  medium_priority: speakers.filter(s =&gt; s.score &gt; 6 && s.score &lt;= 8),
  networking_plan: generateApproachStrategy(speakers)
};
```

## Data Storage & Output Formats

### Storage Options
- **Local JSON files** - Default storage for conference data
- **Google Drive** - For sharing reports with team
