#### What Does This Workflow Do?

The workflow uses a combination of nodes to create a complete chatbot:

1.  **Chat Trigger**: Starts the process when a user sends a message. The configuration includes a customized visual design (minimalist European CSS), welcome messages, and titles.
2.  **AI Agent**: Acts as the chatbot's brain. It coordinates interaction with the language model, memory, and tools to generate intelligent responses.
3.  **Conversational Memory**: Allows the chatbot to remember the context of the conversation, providing a smoother and more coherent experience.
4.  **Language Model (GPT)**: Generates the chat responses.
5.  **Search Tool**: Enables the AI agent to search for information on the web and answer questions it doesn't already know.
6.  **Respond to Chat**: Sends the final response back to the user.
