## How it works

This workflow automates the entire lifecycle of a service-based client, combining four distinct business flows into a single view:

1. **Intake Leads:** Receives a webhook from your form builder, validates the data, optionally enriches the email using Clearbit, and creates records in Airtable and Notion.
2. **Manage Bookings:** Processes scheduling webhooks to update lead status, create Google Calendar events, and send pre-call survey emails.
3. **Send Reminders:** Runs a daily schedule to scan Airtable for upcoming calls and automatically sends 24h reminder emails to reduce no-shows.
4. **Onboard Clients:** Reacts to successful payments by marking leads as "Paid," generating a Notion Onboarding Checklist, and sending a Welcome Kit via Email and WhatsApp.

## Set up steps

1. **Configure Credentials:**
   * Connect your accounts for **Airtable, Notion, Slack, Google Calendar, and GMAIL**.
   * (Optional) Add credentials for **Clearbit** (enrichment) and **Twilio** (WhatsApp).

2. **Customize Emails:**
   * Open the four **Email Send** nodes.
   * Customize the `Body Text` with your own booking links and survey URLs.

3. **Configure Tables & IDs:**
   * Update the **Airtable** nodes with your specific Base and Table names (e.g., `tblLeads`).
   * Update the **Notion** nodes with your Database IDs for Projects and Onboarding.

4. **Connect Webhooks:**
   * Copy the Production URLs from the three Webhook nodes (`Lead Intake`, `Booking`, `Payment`) and paste them into your respective form, calendar, or payment provider settings.
