**Summary**

Onfleet is a last-mile delivery software that provides end-to-end route planning, dispatch, communication, and analytics to handle the heavy lifting while you can focus on your customers.

This workflow template loads in a spreadsheet from your **local storage** and **automatically creates Onfleet tasks** on a one-time basis upon workflow trigger. You can use this workflow as a task importer.

**Configurations**

- Update the `Read Binary File` node with the absolute file path to the local spreadsheet of interest
- Update the Onfleet node with your own Onfleet credentials, to register for an **Onfleet API key**, please visit https://onfleet.com/signup to get started
- You can easily change how the Onfleet task is created by mapping to additional data in the spreadsheet
