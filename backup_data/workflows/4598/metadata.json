  "title": "Fetch random dog images from Dog CEO API via webhook",
  "description": "This n8n template allows you to instantly fetch a random dog image from the Dog CEO API by simply sending a webhook request. It's a fun and simple way to integrate random dog photos into your projects, whether for websites, applications, or playful automations.\n\n---\n\n# 🔧 How it works\n- Trigger Webhook: This node acts as the entry point for the workflow. It listens for any incoming POST request. No specific data is required in the webhook body, as the workflow fetches a random image.\n- Fetch Random Dog Image: This node makes an HTTP GET request to https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random. The API responds with a JSON object containing the URL of a random dog image.\n- Respond with Image URL: This node sends the URL of the random dog image back to the service that initiated the webhook.\n\n---\n\n# 👤 Who is it for?\n### This workflow is ideal for:\n\n- Developers: Quickly integrate random dog images into web applications, bots, or prototypes.\n- Content Creators: Get fresh, random dog photos for social media, blogs, or presentations.\n- Learning n8n: A straightforward example of using a webhook to trigger an API call and return data.\n\n## Anyone who loves dogs!\n\n---\n\n# 📑 Data Structure\nWhen you trigger the webhook, you can send an empty POST request body.\n\nThe workflow will return a JSON response similar to this (the message URL will vary):\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"https://images.dog.ceo/breeds/hound-walker/n02089867_2626.jpg\",\n  \"status\": \"success\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n# ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n- Import Workflow: In your n8n editor, click \"Import from JSON\" and paste the provided workflow JSON.\n- Configure Webhook Path:\n  - Double-click the Trigger Webhook node.\n  - In the 'Path' field, set a unique and descriptive path (e.g., /get-dog-image).\n- Activate Workflow: Save and activate the workflow.\n\n---\n\n# 📝 Tips\n- Download the Image: Instead of just returning the URL, you can download the image and then process it. Insert another HTTP Request node after Fetch Random Dog Image to download the image binary.\n  - Set the HTTP Request node's 'Response Format' to 'Binary'.\n  - Use the expression ={{ $json.message }} for the URL.\n- Save to Cloud Storage: After downloading the image (as described above), you can save it to various cloud storage services:\n  - Google Drive: Add a Google Drive node. Connect it to the output of the image download node. Configure it to upload the binary data to a specific folder.\n  - Amazon S3: Add an AWS S3 node. Configure it to upload the binary data, specifying your bucket and desired filename.\n- Dropbox: Use the Dropbox node to upload the image file.\n- Send as a Message: Share the dog image directly in a chat or email:\n  - Slack/Discord/Telegram: Use the respective integration node to send the image URL or the downloaded image as an attachment.\n  - Email: Attach the downloaded image to an email using an Email or Gmail node.\n- Display on a Web Page: If you're embedding this into a web application, you can simply use the returned URL in an <img> tag to display the image.\n- Error Handling: You can add an Error Trigger node to catch any issues during the image fetching process (e.g., if the Dog CEO API is down) and send notifications.",
