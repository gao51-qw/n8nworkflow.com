This workflow transforms **product images into professional marketing visuals** by combining **AI background generation**, **intelligent copywriting**, and **automated design templating**. Upload a product photo, describe your desired scene, and get publication-ready assets for Meta ads, email campaigns, social media, and more.

The system uses **fal.ai's advanced AI models** (Google Imagen 4, Ideogram v3, Time-of-Day relighting) to create stunning product scenes while **Placid** handles professional text overlay and final composition.
