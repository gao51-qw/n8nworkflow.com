## 💡 What Can You Ask?

## 🧠 System Behavior (Prompt Logic)

GPT-4o is guided by a focused system prompt that makes it act as a gaming strategist, not a rulebook. It returns results like:

```
🧠 Best Move Suggestion: [e.g. Raise with K♠️ J♠️]  
🎯 Why This Move Works: [based on probability & game state]  
📈 Confidence Level: High / Medium / Low
```

If input lacks clarity, the agent will ask for better context or a new screenshot.
