Create Google Calendar events from labeled Gmail emails using AI

Description
Who is it for?
This template is for anyone who frequently receives unstructured event or task information via email and wants to quickly add it to their Google Calendar without manual data entry. It's perfect for busy professionals, personal productivity enthusiasts, and anyone looking to streamline their scheduling.

What it does
This workflow automates the process of creating Google Calendar events from emails you label in Gmail, using AI to parse the details.

Triggers on Labeled Email: The workflow starts when a new email is given a specific label in Gmail (e.g., "Scheduled").

Parses Event with AI: The email's content is sent to Google Gemini to extract structured event data: title, start time, end time, location, and a description.

Creates Calendar Event: Using the data extracted by the AI, a new event is automatically created in your Google Calendar.

Sends Confirmation Email: A confirmation email is sent back to you, containing a summary of the created event and a direct link to edit it in Google Calendar.

Requirements
An active n8n instance.

A Google account for Gmail and Google Calendar.

Credentials for the Google Gemini API.
