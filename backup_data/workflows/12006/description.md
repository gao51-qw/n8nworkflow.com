## Why I built this? (The Problem)
Most expense tracker apps (like Money Lover, Spendee, or Wallet) have a common friction point: **Data Entry**. You have to unlock your phone, find the app, wait for it to load, navigate menus, and manually select categories. It’s tedious, so we often forget to log small expenses.

I wanted a solution that lives where I already spend my time: **Telegram**. This workflow allows you to log expenses in seconds—just by **sending a text**, a **voice note while driving**, or **a photo of a receipt**. No UI navigation required.
### Comparison: This Workflow vs. Traditional Apps
|Feature|Traditional Expense Apps|This n8n Workflow|
|-|-|-|
|**Data Ownership**|Data is locked in their proprietary database.|**100% Yours**. It lives in your Google Sheet. You can export, pivot, or connect it to Looker Studio.|
|**Input Speed**|Slow. Requires multiple taps/clicks.|**Instant**. Send a text/voice/photo to a Telegram bot.|
|**Flexibility**|Rigid categories & logic.|**Infinite**. You can customize the AI prompt, categories, and currency logic.|
|**Cost**|Often requires monthly subscriptions for premium features.|**Low Cost**. Runs on your n8n instance + Gemini Flash API (which is currently free/very cheap).|
|**UI/UX**|Beautiful, pre-built mobile dashboards.|**Raw Data**. You view data in Google Sheets (though you can build a dashboard there)|

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Input:** Just send what you have.
 -- ***Text***: "Lunch 50k, Taxi 30k" (Splits into 2 rows).
 -- ***Voice***: Speak naturally, AI transcribes and extracts data.
 -- ***Photo***: OCRs receipts and parses details.

- **Global Currency Support:** Uses Gemini AI to intelligently detect currency. You can set a default currency (e.g., USD, VND) in the Config node.

- **Smart Extraction & Categorization:**
-- *Automatically splits* multiple items in one message (e.g., "Lunch 20k and Grab 50k" → 2 separate rows). 
-- *AI automatically* assigns *categories* (Food, Transport, Bills, etc.) based on the item name.

- **Budget Management:** Use the command `/add budget 500` to instantly top up your monthly budget.
- **"Quiet" Reporting:** Instead of spamming you after every message, the system waits for **30 minutes of inactivity** before sending a daily summary report (Debounce logic).

## Setup Instructions
**1. Prerequisites**
- **Google Sheet:** You **MUST** make a copy of this template: **[[Google Sheet Template here]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVdxslvMkTA1DDQv6kQ5j-COC8ZOH8AfEWmn31Rq6l4/edit?usp=sharing)**

- **n8n Data Table:** This workflow requires a Data Table named `ReportTokens` for the reporting feature. Please read the setup guide below. **[Setup Guide: AI Expense Tracker](https://heavenly-slash-181.notion.site/Setup-Guide-AI-Expense-Tracker-2d1bb04db1cf80c6ad88cc15e83a7c47?source=copy_link)**

**2. Configure the Workflow**
- **Credentials:** Connect **Telegram**, **Google Sheets**, and **Google Gemini (PaLM)**.

- **Config Node:** Open the `CONFIG - User Settings` node and update these fields.

	-- `spreadsheet_id`: The ID of your copied Google Sheet
	-- `sheet_gid_dashboard`: The ID of your sheet Dashboard
	-- `sheet_gid_budget`: he ID of your sheet Budget_Topups
	-- `currency_code`: Your currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, VND).
	-- `currency_symbol`: Your currency symbol (e.g., $, €, ₫).
	-- `locale`: Your locale for number formatting (e.g., en-US, vi-VN).

- **Data Table**: Create a table in n8n with columns: `chat_id`, `report_token`, `updated_at` (All type: String). Link this table to the relevant nodes in the workflow.

**3. Usage**

- **Log Expense**: Send *"Coffee $5"* or a photo.
- **Add Budget**: Send command `/add budget 1000`
