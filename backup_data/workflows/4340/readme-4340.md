# Generate qualified leads from LinkedIn with Apify, GPT-4, and Airtable

> ## Who is this for?

This workflow is perfect for **sales teams**, **business development professionals**, **recruitment agencies**, and **fractional CFO service providers** who need to identify and qualify companies actively hiring. Whether you're prospecting for new clients, building a database of potential customers, or researching market opportunities, this automated solution saves hours of manual research while delivering high-quality, AI-analyzed leads.

## What problem is this workflow solving?

Finding qualified prospects in the finance sector is time-consuming and often inefficient. Traditional methods involve:
- Manually browsing LinkedIn job postings for hours
- Difficulty distinguishing between genuine opportunities and recruitment spam
- Inconsistent lead categorization and qualification
- Risk of contacting the same companies multiple times
- Lack of structured data for sales team follow-up

This workflow automates the entire lead generation process, from data collection to AI-powered qualification, ensuring you focus only on the most promising opportunities.

## What this workflow does

This comprehensive lead generation system performs six key functions:

1. **Automated LinkedIn Job Scraping**: Uses Apify's reliable LinkedIn Jobs Scraper to extract detailed job postings for finance positions, including company information, job descriptions, and contact details.

2. **Smart Data Processing**: Removes duplicates, filters companies by size, and structures data for consistent analysis across all leads.

3. **Intelligent Lead Categorization**: Compares new leads against your existing database to optimize processing and avoid duplicate work.

4. **AI-Powered Qualification**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Mini to analyze each lead and determine:
   - **Company Category**: Consumer companies, Fractional CFO services, Recruiting agencies, or Other
   - **Finance Role Validation**: Confirms the position is genuinely finance-related
   - **Seniority Level**: Entry, Mid, Senior, Director, or C-Level classification
   - **Job Summary**: Concise description for quick sales team review

5. **Automated Database Management**: Stores qualified leads in Airtable with comprehensive profiles, preventing duplicates while maintaining data integrity.

6. **Lead Scoring & Routing**: Prioritizes leads based on processing status and qualification results for efficient sales team follow-up.

   - "OpenAI GPT-4 Mini" node (OpenAI credential) 
   - "Save to Airtable" and "Get Existing Leads" nodes (Airtable credential)
3. **Configure Airtable Connection**: Update the base ID and table ID in both Airtable nodes
4. **Set Search Parameters**: In the "Edit Variables" node, configure:
   - `linkedinUrls`: Your target LinkedIn job search URLs
   - `maxEmployees`: Maximum company size filter (default: 200)
   - `batchSize`: Processing batch size for API efficiency (default: 5)

### Step 4: Test the Workflow

1. Start with a small test by setting `count: 50` in the HTTP Request node
2. Use a specific LinkedIn job search URL (e.g., "CFO jobs in New York")
3. Execute the workflow manually and verify results in your Airtable base
4. Review the AI categorization accuracy and adjust prompts if needed

## How to customize this workflow to your needs

### Targeting Different Roles
Modify the LinkedIn search URLs in the "Edit Variables" node to target different positions:
```
- "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=Controller"
- "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=Finance%20Director"  
- "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=VP%20Finance"
```

### Adjusting Company Size Filters
Change the `maxEmployees` parameter to focus on different company segments:
- Startups: 1-50 employees
- SMBs: 51-500 employees  
- Enterprise: 500+ employees

### Customizing AI Analysis
Enhance the GPT-4 prompt in the "AI Lead Analyzer" node to include:
- Industry-specific criteria
- Geographic preferences
- Technology stack requirements
- Company growth stage indicators

### Integration Options
Extend the workflow by adding:
- **Slack notifications** for new qualified leads
- **Email alerts** for high-priority prospects
- **CRM integration** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive)
- **Lead enrichment** with additional data sources

### Scheduling Automation
Set up the workflow to run automatically:
- **Daily**: For active prospecting campaigns
- **Weekly**: For ongoing market research
- **Monthly**: For periodic database updates

## Performance & Cost Optimization

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **Rate Limiting**: Increase delays between API calls if you encounter rate limits
