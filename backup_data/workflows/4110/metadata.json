This workflow solves that by:\n- Cloning a viral TikTok video’s structure\n- Generating a new version with your avatar\n- Rewriting the script, caption, and overlay text\n- Auto-posting it to 9 social media platforms — without manual uploads\n\n### What this workflow does\n\nFrom a simple Telegram message with a TikTok link, the workflow:\n\n1. **Downloads a TikTok video** and extracts its thumbnail, audio, and caption\n2. **Transcribes the audio** and saves original text into Google Sheets\n3. **Uses Perplexity AI** to suggest a new content idea in the same niche\n4. **Rewrites the script, caption, and overlay** using GPT-4o\n5. **Generates a new video** with your avatar using Captions.ai\n6. **Adds subtitles and overlay text** with JSON2Video\n7. **Saves metadata** to Google Sheets for tracking\n8. **Sends the final video to Telegram** for preview\n9. **Auto-publishes the video** to Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, Threads, X (Twitter), Pinterest, and Bluesky via Blotato\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Connect your **Telegram bot** to the trigger node.\n2. Add your **OpenAI, Perplexity, Cloudinary, Captions.ai, and Blotato API keys**.\n3. Make sure your **Google Sheet** is ready with the appropriate columns.\n4. Replace the default **avatar name** in the Captions.ai node with yours.\n5. Fill in your **social media account IDs** in the \"Assign Platform IDs\" node.\n6. Test by sending a TikTok URL to your Telegram bot.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **Change avatar output style**: adjust resolution, voice, or avatar ID.\n- **Refine script structure**: tweak GPT instructions for different tone/format.\n- **Swap Perplexity with ChatGPT or Claude** if needed.\n- **Filter by platform**: disable any Blotato nodes you don’t need.\n- **Add approval step**: insert a Telegram confirmation node before publishing.\n- **Adjust subtitle style or overlay text font** in JSON2Video.\n\n📄 **Documentation**: [Notion Guide](https://automatisation.notion.site/WORKFLOW-n8n-1f13d6550fd980a7ab0dce650796ebaa?pvs=4)\n\n---\n\n### Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support : [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-firas/) / [Youtube](https:/https://www.youtube.com/@DRFIRASS)",
