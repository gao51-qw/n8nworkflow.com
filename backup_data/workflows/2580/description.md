This n8n template builds upon a simple appointment request form design which uses AI to qualify if the incoming enquiry is suitable and/or time-worthy of an appointment.

This demonstrates a lighter approach to using AI in your templates but handles a technically difficult problem - contextual understanding! This example can be used in a variety of contexts where figuring out what is and isn't relevant can save a lot of time for your organisation.

## How it works
* We start with a form trigger which asks for the purpose of the appointment.
* Instantly, we can qualify this by using a text classifier node which uses AI's contextual understanding to ensure the appointment is worthwhile. If not, an alternative is suggested instead.
* Multi-page forms are then used to set the terms of the appointment and ask the user for a desired date and time.
* An acknowledgement is sent to the user while an approval by email process is triggered in the background.
* In a subworkflow, we use Gmail with the wait for approval operation to send an approval form to the admin user who can either confirm or decline the appointment request.
* When approved, a Google Calendar event is created. When declined, the user is notified  via email that the appointment request was declined.

## How to use
* Modify the enquiry classifier to determine which contexts are relevant to you.
* Configure the wait for approval node to send to an email address which is accessible to all appropriate team members.

## Requirements
* OpenAI for LLM
* Gmail for Email
* Google Calendar for Appointments

## Customising this workflow
* Not using Google Mail or Calendar? Feel free to swap this with other services.
* The wait for approval step is optional. Remove if you wish to handle appointment request resolution in another way.
