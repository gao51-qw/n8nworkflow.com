  "description": "**Edit 19/11/2024**: As explained on the workflow, the **AI Agent with the original system prompt was not effective when using `gpt4-o-mini`**.\n\nTo address this, I **optimized the prompt to work better with this model.** You can find the prompts I’ve tested on this **[Notion Page](https://dataki.notion.site/Prompts-for-n8n-Workflow-AI-Agent-to-Chat-with-Your-Search-Console-Data-143a162bd9cd8000b4d6dc8750a0d83f)**. And yes, there is one that **works well with `gpt4-o-mini`**.\n\n## AI Agent to chat with you Search Console Data, using OpenAI and Postgres\n\n\n\nThis **AI Agent enables you to interact with your Search Console data** through a **chat interface**. Each node is **documented within the template**, providing sufficient information for setup and usage. You will also need to **configure Search Console OAuth credentials**.\n\nFollow this **[n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-generic/#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen)** to set up the OAuth credentials.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### Correctly Configure Scopes for Search Console API Calls\n- It’s essential to **configure the scopes correctly** in your Google Search Console API OAuth2 credentials. Incorrect **configuration can cause issues with the refresh token**, requiring frequent reconnections. Below is the configuration I use to **avoid constant re-authentication**:\n![Search Console API oAuth2 config 1](https://i.imgur.com/vVLM7gG.png)\n![Search Console API oAuth2 config 2](https://i.imgur.com/naT1NaX.png)\n\nOf course, you'll need to add your **client_id** and **client_secret** from the **Google Cloud Platform app** you created to access your Search Console data.\n\n### Configure Authentication for the Webhook\n\nSince the **webhook will be publicly accessible**, don’t forget to **set up authentication**. I’ve used **Basic Auth**, but feel free to **choose the method that best meets your security requirements**.\n\n## 🤩💖 Example of awesome things you can do with this AI Agent\n![Example of chat with this AI Agent](https://i.imgur.com/jbfsYvT.png)\n",
