  "description": "🔍 What This Workflow Does\n\nThis RAG Pipeline in n8n automates document ingestion from Google Drive, vectorizes it using OpenAI embeddings, stores it in Pinecone, and enables chat-based retrieval using LangChain agents.\n\nMain Functions:\n\n📂 Auto-detects new files uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder.\n🧠 Converts the file into embeddings using OpenAI.\n📦 Stores them in a Pinecone vector database.\n💬 Allows a user to query the knowledge base through a chat interface.\n🤖 Uses a GPT-4o-mini model with LangChain to generate intelligent responses using retrieved context.\n⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n1. Connect Accounts\nEnsure these services are connected in n8n:\n\n✅ Google Drive (OAuth2)\n✅ OpenAI\n✅ Pinecone\nYou can do this in n8n &gt; Credentials &gt; New and use the matching names from the file:\n\nGoogle Drive: \"Google Drive account 2\"\nOpenAI: \"OpenAi success\"\nPinecone: \"PineconeApi account 2\"\n2. Folder Setup\nUpload your documents to this folder in Google Drive:\n\n📁 Power Folder\n\nThe workflow is triggered every minute when a new file is uploaded.\n\n3. Workflow Overview\nA. File Ingestion Path\n\nGoogle Drive Trigger — detects new file.\nGoogle Drive (Download) — downloads the new file.\nRecursive Text Splitter — splits text into chunks.\nDefault Data Loader — loads content as LangChain documents.\nOpenAI Embeddings — converts text chunks into embeddings.\nPinecone Vector Store — stores them in \"ragfile\" index.\nB. Chat Retrieval Path\n\nWhen chat message received — \nAI Agent — LangChain agent managing tools.\nOpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4o-mini) — generates replies.\nPinecone Vector Store (retrieval) — retrieves matching content.\nEmbeddings OpenAI1 — helps match queries to document chunks.\n\n",
