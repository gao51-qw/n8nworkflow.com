## **Automated Pre-Issued Workshop Certificate Generator**

## **Description:**

This workflow automates the entire pre-issuance process of workshop participation certificates.
When an attendee submits a registration form via a webhook, the workflow validates the data, verifies the attendee’s email, generates a unique Certificate ID and QR code, creates a styled certificate image, stores it on Google Drive, emails the certificate to the attendee, logs all details in Google Sheets, and notifies organizers via Slack — all fully automated.

This template is ideal for institutions, event teams, training organizations, hackathons, and workshops that want to automate certificate issuing and remove manual processing.
