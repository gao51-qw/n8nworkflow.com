  "description": "This workflow demonstrates how to use `noItemsLeft` to check if there are items left to be processed by the SplitInBatches node.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:453)\n\n**Function node:** This node generates mock data for the workflow. Replace it with the node whose data you want to split into batches.\n\n**SplitInBatches node:** This node splits the data with the batch size equal to `1`. Based on your use-case, set the value of the ***Batch Size***.\n\n**IF node:** This node check if all the data by the SplitInBatches are not processed or not. It uses the expression `{{$node[\"SplitInBatches\"].context[\"noItemsLeft\"]}}` which returns a boolean value.\nIf there is data yet to be processed, the expression will return `false`, otherwise `true`.\n\n**Set node:** This node prints a message `No Items Left`. Based on your use-case, connect the false output of the *IF* node to the input of the node you want to execute, after the data is processed by the *SplitInBatches* node.",
