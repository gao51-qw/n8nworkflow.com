Recent Announcements and Market Activity:**  \n- Summarize **recent press releases, product launches, partnerships, or growth milestones**.  \n- If hiring data is available, note whether the company is **actively recruiting**.  \n- Capture any **noteworthy social engagement** (e.g., G2 rankings, LinkedIn hiring growth, conference participation).  \n\n#### **5. Company Posts (Including Timestamps):**  \n- Extract all **company posts**, including **the date they were published**.  \n- Summarize the **core message** of each post.  \n- Include links if available.  \n\n**Format for Posts Section:**  \n📅 **[Date]** - **Post Title or Summary**  \nPost ALL content.  \n\n### **Additional Guidelines:**  \n- **Extract and use the exact employee count** instead of a company size range.  \n- **The analysis must be concise, fact-based, and structured** without assumptions or filler content.  \n- **Use exact data where available** (e.g., \"Founded in 2020\" instead of \"several years ago\").  \n- **Maintain a professional tone and structured formatting** for easy CRM readability.  \n- **Ensure all extracted variables are seamlessly integrated** into the summary."
