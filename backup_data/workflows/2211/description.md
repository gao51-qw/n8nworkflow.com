Keeping your YouTube video descriptions updated and consistent across your channel can be a daunting task. Manually editing each video is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors.

This workflow streamlines this process, allowing you to maintain a shared section in all your video descriptions and effortlessly update them all at once.

By incorporating a unique identifier, you can automate updates across your entire channel, keeping your content fresh and relevant with minimal effort.

## How it Works
- **Define Your Unique Delimiter:** Choose your unique delimiter (e.g., "---n8ninja---"). It will be visible, so select something appropriate for your audience.
- **Automate Updates:** Anything below the delimiter can be automatically updated by this workflow.
- **Configure Text Updates:** Set the text you wish to add to every video description in the configuration node.

## Getting Started
- **Integrate Google (YouTube) Credentials:** Securely add your credentials to enable API access.
- **Set Up the Configuration Node:** Define your delimiter and the text for the shared section you wish to append to your video descriptions.
- **Prepare Your Videos:** Add the chosen delimiter to all videos you want to update automatically.
- **Execute the Workflow:** Run the workflow whenever you wish to batch update the descriptions of your videos.
