  "description": "## Short description\nTranscribe Telegram voice/audio messages to text using Groq’s OpenAI-compatible Whisper endpoint. Replies are delivered either as a Telegram message or as a downloadable `.txt` file, plug-and-play for n8n with minimal setup.\n\n## Who’s it for / Uses\n- Educators, podcasters, interviewers, and support teams who need quick voice → text conversions.  \n- Automating meeting notes, voice feedback, voicemail transcription, or speech logging.  \n- Useful when you want transcripts pushed to chat or saved as files for archiving.\n\n## How it works (overview)\n1. **Telegram Trigger** — workflow starts on incoming message.  \n2. **Switch (Audio/Voice)** — detects `voice` or `audio`. If neither, replies “Wrong file type” and stops.  \n3. **Telegram Download** — downloads the audio using the `file_id`, outputs file path/binary.  \n4. **Set Node (credentials + options)** — stores `Groq_API` and `Telegram_access_token` (required) and `transcript_output_format` (`message` or `file`).  \n5. **HTTP Request → Groq (Whisper)** — uploads audio (multipart/form-data) to Groq’s transcription endpoint and receives text.  \n6. **Reply Switch** — routes to either:  \n   - **Message branch:** send transcribed text as a Telegram message.  \n   - **File branch:** convert transcript to `.txt` and send as a document.\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted) with internet access  \n- Telegram bot token (create via BotFather)  \n- Groq API key (create at https://console.groq.com/keys)  \n- Basic n8n nodes: Telegram Trigger, Switch, Telegram Download, Set, HTTP Request, Convert to File, Telegram Send Message/Document\n\n## Important setup & notes\n- **Mandatory:** Add `Groq_API` and `Telegram_access_token` in the **Set** node (or use n8n Credentials). The workflow will fail without them.  \n- **Do not hardcode** keys in HTTP node fields that will be exported/shared. Use Set fields or n8n Credentials.  \n- Include **sticky notes** explaining each node (yellow note with full description recommended). Sticky notes should show setup steps and required fields.  \n- Before publishing: remove personal IDs and secrets, test with sample voice messages, and verify Groq response schema to map the transcript field correctly.\n\n## Security & best practices\n- Use n8n Credentials or environment variables in production.  \n- Rotate API keys if they become exposed.  \n- Keep the Set node private when sharing templates; instruct users to replace keys with their own.\n",
