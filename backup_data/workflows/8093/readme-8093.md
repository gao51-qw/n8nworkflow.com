# Ai-powered degree audit system with Google Sheets and GPT-5

> Run an **AI-powered degree audit** for each senior student. This template reads student rows from Google Sheets, evaluates completed courses against **hard-coded program requirements**, and writes back an **AI Degree Summary** of what's still missing (major core, Gen Eds, major electives, and upper-division credits). It's designed for quick advisor/registrar review and SIS prototypes.

**Trigger:** Manual — *When clicking "Execute workflow"*  
**Core nodes:** Google Sheets, OpenAI Chat Model, (optional) Structured Output Parser  
**Programs included:** Computer Science BS, Business Administration BBA, Psychology BA, Mechanical Engineering BS, Biology BS (Pre-Med), English Literature BA, Data Science BS, Nursing BSN, Economics BA, Graphic Design BFA

## Who's it for
- **Registrars & advisors** who need fast, consistent degree checks  
- **Student success teams** building prototype dashboards  
- **SIS/EdTech builders** exploring AI-assisted auditing

## How it works
1. **Read seniors** from Google Sheets (`Senior_data`) with: `StudentID`, `Name`, `Program`, `Year`, `CompletedCourses`.  
2. **AI Agent** compares `CompletedCourses` to built-in requirements (per program) and computes **Missing** items + a short **Summary**.  
3. **Write back** to the same sheet using "Append or update" by `StudentID` (updates **AI Degree Summary**; you can also map the raw **Missing** array to a column if desired).

**Example JSON (for one student):**
{
 "StudentID": "S001",
 "Program": "Computer Science BS",
 "Missing": [
   "GEN-REMAIN | General Education credits remaining | 6",
   "CS-EL-REM | CS Major Electives (200+ level) | 6",
   "UPPER-DIV | Additional Upper-Division (200+ level) credits needed | 18",
   "FREE-EL | Free Electives to reach 120 total credits | 54"
 ],
 "Summary": "All core CS courses are complete. Still need 6 Gen Ed credits, 6 CS electives, and 66 total credits overall, including 18 upper-division credits — prioritize 200/300-level CS electives."
}

## Setup (2 steps)

### 1) Connect Google Sheets (OAuth2)
In n8n → Credentials → New → Google Sheets (OAuth2) and sign in.

In the Google Sheets nodes, select your spreadsheet and the Senior_data tab.

Ensure your input sheet has at least: StudentID, Name, Program, Year, CompletedCourses.

### 2) Connect OpenAI (API Key)
In n8n → Credentials → New → OpenAI API, paste your key.

In the OpenAI Chat Model node, select that credential and a model (e.g., gpt-4o or gpt-5).

## Requirements
- **Sheet columns:** StudentID, Name, Program, Year, CompletedCourses
- **CompletedCourses format:** pipe-separated IDs (e.g., GEN-101|GEN-103|CS-101).
- **Program labels:** should match the built-in list (e.g., Computer Science BS).
- **Credits/levels:** Template assumes upper-division ≥ 200-level (adjust the prompt if your policy differs).

## Customization
- **Change requirements:** Edit the Agent's system message to update totals, core lists, elective credit rules, or level thresholds.
- **Store more output:** Map Missing to a new column (e.g., AI Missing List) or write rows to a separate sheet for dashboards.
- **Distribute results:** Email summaries to advisors/students (Gmail/Outlook), or generate PDFs for advising folders.
- **Add guardrails:** Extend the prompt to enforce residency, capstone, minor/cognate constraints, or per-college Gen Ed variations.

## Best practices (per n8n guidelines)
- **Sticky notes are mandatory:** Include a yellow sticky note that contains this description and quick setup steps; add neutral sticky notes for per-step tips.
- **Rename nodes clearly:** e.g., "Get Seniors," "Degree Audit Agent," "Update Summary."
- **No hardcoded secrets:** Use credentials—not inline keys in HTTP or Code nodes.
- **Sanitize identifiers:** Don't ship personal spreadsheet IDs or private links in the published version.
- **Use a Set node for config:** Centralize user-tunable values (e.g., column names, tab names).

## Troubleshooting
- **OpenAI 401/429:** Verify API key/billing; slow concurrency if rate-limited.
- **Empty summaries:** Check column names and that CompletedCourses uses |.
- **Program mismatch:** Align Program labels to those in the prompt (exact naming recommended).
- **Sheets auth errors:** Reconnect Google Sheets OAuth2 and re-select spreadsheet/tab.

## Limitations
- **Not an official audit:** It infers gaps from the listed completions; registrar rules can be more nuanced.
- **Catalog drift:** Requirements are hard-coded in the prompt—update them each term/year.
- **Upper-division heuristic:** Adjust the level threshold if your institution defines it differently.
