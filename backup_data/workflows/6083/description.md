# 🎯 Goal

Every 60 minutes:

- Fetch only “New” leads from a Google Sheet  
- Send them a personalized email  
- Update their status to “Contacted” in the same sheet  

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1️⃣ 🕒 Trigger: Run Every Day  
**Node Name:** Schedule Trigger  
**What it does:** Automatically starts the workflow every 60 minutes (or your chosen interval).  
**Why it's needed:** You don’t need to run the workflow manually — it runs on a timer, like a robot doing your follow-up.

---

### 2️⃣ 📄 Fetch Leads from Google Sheet  
**Node Name:** Fetch Leads from Google Sheet  
**What it does:** Connects to your Google Sheet and pulls all the rows of leads.  
**Expected columns:**

- Name  
- Email  
- Status (should be "New" if not yet emailed)  

---

### 3️⃣ 🔍 Filter Only New Leads  
**Node Name:** Filter Only New Leads  
**What it does:** Filters only rows where `Status = New`.  
**Why it's needed:** Prevents emailing the same lead twice. Old leads are ignored.

---

### 4️⃣ 🔁 Batch Process Leads  
**Node Name:** Batch Process Leads  
**What it does:** Splits filtered leads into individual batches (usually one-by-one).  
**Why it's useful:** Helps avoid API rate limits or spam blocks by sending emails one at a time.

---

### 5️⃣ ✉️ Send Email to Lead  
**Node Name:** Send Email to Lead  
**What it does:** Sends a personalized email to each lead using their name and email.  
**How personalization works:** Use variables like `{{ $json["Name"] }}` in the subject/body.

---

### 6️⃣ ✅ Mark Lead as Contacted  
**Node Name:** Mark Lead as Contacted  
**What it does:** Updates the row in Google Sheet, changing Status from `New` to `Contacted`.  
**Why it's important:** Ensures this lead won't be processed again next time.

---

## 🔁 Loop Back

After updating the lead status, the flow loops back to process the next lead from the batch.
