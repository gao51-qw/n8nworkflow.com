## Use Case
Automatically archive emails in your Gmail inbox from the last day, **unless they have been starred.**

Been using this with my personal and work emails to stick to an **Inbox Zero** strategy, without having to click or swipe a lot. 

## Setup 
1. Add your Gmail creds

## How to adjust this template
Set your own schedule for when to run this. Otherwise, should be good to go. 🤞🏽
