# Get your own custom ChatGPT inside your Slack Workspace 
![sl.png](fileId:1734)

## Description
This n8n workflow enables a fully autonomous AI assistant within your Slack Workspace. It listens for both public mentions and direct messages (DMs), and replies in real-time using a large language model (OpenAI's GPT-4o by default). The assistant can dynamically fetch previous messages for better context, providing smart, coherent, and personalized responses.

---

### 🔧 **Key Features**

- **Dual Trigger**: Reacts to both public bot mentions and private DMs.
- **Context-Aware AI**: Dynamically fetches the last 20 messages from either public or private conversations.
- **Smart Routing**: Replies either in the original public channel or via DM, depending on where the message came from.
- **Custom Prompting**: Easily modify the system prompt to define the AI’s tone, behavior, and personality.
- **Fully Autonomous**: No manual intervention required — the bot always replies instantly.

---

### ✅ Requirements

- An operational **n8n instance**.
- A Slack workspace (you can create one for free [here](https://slack.com/get-started?entry_point=workspaces))
- A Slack account with **Admin** or **Owner** privileges (required to install apps)

- Set your Slack bot token in n8n's credential manager.

---

### 🤖 **How It Works**

- When a **public mention** is detected, the bot replies directly in the channel, referencing the original message.
- When a **DM** is received, it responds privately.
- The AI uses a tool to **read the latest 20 public or private messages** to build accurate context before replying.

---

### 🛠 **Customization Options**

- **Change LLM**: Swap out OpenAI with any LLM that has an API.
- **Edit Prompt Behavior**: Modify the system prompt to control tone and personality.
