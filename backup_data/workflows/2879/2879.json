    "description": "**How it Works:**\n\n1.  **Trigger:** The workflow is triggered by a webhook, initiated by an Airtable automation.  This automation sends the Book or Chapter record ID and the desired action (e.g., \"Generate Book Details,\" \"Generate Chapters,\" \"Generate Chapter Research,\" \"Generate Chapter Content\").\n2.  **Action Routing:**  A \"Switch\" node directs the workflow based on the `action` query parameter received from the webhook.  This determines which part of the book creation process will be executed.\n3.  **Data Retrieval:**  The workflow fetches the relevant book or chapter data from Airtable using the provided `recordId`.\n4.  **AI Processing:**\n    *   **Book Details Generation:**  If the action is \"Generate Book Details,\" an AI Agent (powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) like Google Gemini and the Perplexity search tool) researches the book idea.  It focuses on crafting a compelling book description, identifying the target audience, and conducting general book research to maximize bestseller potential.  The research brief is then saved back to Airtable.\n    *   **Chapter Generation:** If the action is \"Generate Chapters,\" an LLM generates 7-10 chapter titles and descriptions based on the book idea and previous research.  A structured output parser ensures the chapter data is in the correct format. The chapters are then split into individual items and saved as separate records in the \"Chapter\" table in Airtable, linked to the main book record.\n    *   **Chapter Research Generation:** If the action is \"Generate Chapter Research,\" another AI Agent conducts in-depth research on a specific chapter, using the Perplexity search tool multiple times. It focuses on finding stories, case studies, historical events, and expert perspectives to make the chapter engaging and credible. The research is saved back to the \"Chapter\" record in Airtable.\n    *   **Chapter Content Generation:** If the action is \"Generate Chapter Content,\" an LLM writes the full content of the chapter, using the research gathered in the previous step, the overall book research, and the chapter description.  The generated content is saved back to the \"Chapter\" record in Airtable.\n5.  **Airtable Updates:**  In each of the AI processing steps, the workflow updates the corresponding Airtable record (either \"Book\" or \"Chapter\") with the generated results (research, chapter details, or content) and sets the \"Action\" field back to \"Idle.\"\n\n**Set Up Steps:**\n\n![image.png](fileId:935)\n\n1.  **Airtable Setup (Estimated time: 10-15 minutes):**\n    *   Copy the Airtable base blueprint: [https://airtable.com/appfkz4KUlKvOjtbp/shra78TlDfqLRdSfT](https://airtable.com/appfkz4KUlKvOjtbp/shra78TlDfqLRdSfT). This will create the \"Book\" and \"Chapter\" tables with the necessary fields.\n    *   In the \"Book\" table, create three Airtable Automations:\n        *   **Trigger:** When a record matches conditions -&gt; `Action` is `Generate Book Details`\n        *   **Action:** Run a script. Use the following script:\n\n            ```javascript\n            let autoRoute = input.config();\n            await fetch(autoRoute.webhookUrl + \"?recordId=\" + autoRoute.recordId + \"&action=\" + autoRoute.action);\n            ```\n        *       In the script action's configuration, add three \"Input variables\":\n                 *   `webhookUrl` (map it to your n8n webhook URL, obtained in the next step)\n                 *   `recordId` (map it to the Airtable record ID)\n                 *  `action` (map it to `Action`)\n        *   Repeat this process to create two more automations in the \"Book\" table, identical except triggered when `Action` is `Generate Chapters`, respectively.\n    *   In the \"Chapter\" table, create two Airtable Automations:\n        *   **Trigger:** When a record matches conditions -&gt; `Action` is `Generate Chapter Research`\n        *   **Action:** Run a script (use the same script as above, with the same input variables).\n        *   Create a second automation, identical except triggered when `Action` is `Generate Chapter Content`.\n\n2.  **n8n Setup (Estimated time: 15-20 minutes):**\n    *   Import the provided JSON workflow into n8n.\n    *   **Webhook Node:**\n        *   Copy the \"Test URL\" from the Webhook node.  This is the `webhookUrl` you'll use in the Airtable automations.  *Important: Once you've tested and are ready to go live, switch to the \"Production URL.\"*\n    *   **Airtable Nodes:**\n        *   Configure *all* Airtable nodes (there are eight).  You'll need to connect your Airtable account using OAuth 2.  Select the correct Base (\"Book Agency \\[v1] Cobuild\" or whatever you named it) and Table (\"Book\" or \"Chapter\") for each node.  The field mappings are already defined in the template, but double-check them.\n    *   **LLM Nodes (Google Gemini & OpenAI):**\n        *   Connect your Google Gemini and OpenAI accounts to the respective LLM nodes. You'll need API keys for both. You may also configure different LLM Models.\n    *  **Perplexity Nodes**\n        *  Connect your Perplexity AI API to the Perplexity nodes. You'll need API keys for that.\n    *   **Activate** the workflow.\n\n3. **Testing (Estimated Time: 5-10 minutes):**\n     * Go to your Airtable \"Book\" table. Create a New Record.\n     *  Fill in the \"Idea\" field with a book concept.\n     *  Change the \"Action\" field to \"Generate Book Details\".\n     *   The Airtable automation should trigger, sending a request to your n8n webhook.\n     *   Monitor the n8n execution log to see the workflow in action.\n      *   Check the Airtable record to see if the \"Research\" field is populated.\n      *  Repeat the testing for `Generate Chapters`, `Generate Chapter Research` and `Generate Chapter Content`.",

              "text": "## Chapter 1: Origins of Formula 1: Post-War Beginnings\n\nThe roar of engines, a symphony of raw power and mechanical fury, echoed through the crisp air as Europe began to heal from the scars of war. It was 1945, and the world was eager for a new beginning, a distraction from the ruins and a return to the thrill of life. In this atmosphere of renewed hope and burgeoning innovation, the seeds of Formula 1 were sown. The world was witnessing not just the revival of motorsport, but the birth of a legend that would captivate generations.\n\nThe immediate post-war years were a time of stark contrasts. Much of Europe lay in rubble, yet the human spirit, unyielding and resilient, sought avenues of expression and excitement. The automobile, once a symbol of freedom and progress, had been central to the war machine. Now, it was poised to reclaim its place in the hearts of the people, not as a tool of destruction, but as a symbol of speed, skill, and ingenuity.\n\nIn the United States and across the Atlantic, an economic boom fueled a burgeoning car culture. The open road beckoned, and with it, the desire for speed and competition. The establishment of the U.S. Interstate Highway System in 1956 further solidified the car's central role in American life, creating a fertile ground for the growth of motorsports. Back in Europe, the French, ever passionate about their automotive heritage, were instrumental in reviving the racing scene. As early as September 9, 1945, the roar of engines returned to the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, for the first post-war race in Europe, the \"Coupe des Prisonniers,\" a symbolic event that represented liberation and the return of joy and excitement.\n\nThis race was a testament to the enduring allure of the sport. Pre-war Grand Prix machines, lovingly maintained or hastily cobbled together, once again took to the track. It was a bridge between eras, a nostalgic nod to the past and a bold step into the future, the cars themselves were a mix of pre-war models and early prototypes, showcasing a blend of old-world craftsmanship and emerging technologies. The drivers, some veterans of pre-war races, others new to the sport, shared a common passion—a love for speed and a desire to push the limits of man and machine. Among them was the legendary Jean-Pierre Wimille, driving a Bugatti Type 59, who dominated the race, showcasing the enduring prowess of pre-war technology and his exceptional driving skills.\n\nTechnological advancements born from the crucible of war found new life on the racetrack. Aerodynamics, honed in the design of fighter planes, now shaped the contours of racing cars. Powerful engines, developed for military vehicles, now propelled these machines to new speeds. The transition from war to peace saw a rapid evolution in automotive technology, and racing became the ultimate testing ground for these innovations. This era was about more than just speed; it was about ingenuity, about taking the lessons learned from war and applying them to a new arena of competition.\n\nIt was in this environment of rapid change and fervent competition that the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) stepped in, recognizing the need for a structured and unified approach to racing. In 1946, the FIA's Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) laid down the foundation for what would become Formula 1, the regulations established a new formula for Grand Prix racing, initially known as Formula A, which would later be renamed Formula 1. These early rules were designed to create a level playing field, balancing the power of supercharged engines with that of normally aspirated ones. It was a delicate dance of engineering and regulation, aimed at fostering competition while keeping the nascent sport accessible.\n\nThe first races under the new Formula 1 regulations, held in 1947, were a mix of old and new. Established teams like Alfa Romeo and Maserati, with their pre-war pedigree, faced off against emerging manufacturers eager to make their mark. The tracks, too, were a mix of pre-war circuits and new venues, each with its own unique character and challenges. It was a time of experimentation, of learning, and of fierce rivalry. Drivers like Achille Varzi, and Luigi Villoresi became household names, their exploits on the track followed with rapt attention by fans around the world.\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, a new force was rising in the world of motorsport—the British. Teams like Cooper, led by the visionary Charles Cooper and his son John, began to challenge the Italian dominance. Their innovative rear-engined cars, a radical departure from the traditional front-engined designs, were lighter, more agile, and faster through the corners. This marked a significant turning point in the sport's history, with British engineering challenging the status quo and introducing revolutionary concepts that would reshape the future of Formula 1.\n\nThe culmination of these early years of Formula 1 came in 1950, with the inauguration of the first World Championship of Drivers. It was a bold step, a move that elevated the sport from a collection of individual races to a unified global championship. The first race of this historic championship took place on May 13, 1950, at the Silverstone Circuit in England. The British Grand Prix, as it was known, was a momentous occasion, attended by King George VI, marking the first time a reigning monarch had attended a motor race in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe race itself was a thrilling spectacle, with Alfa Romeo's dominant 158, affectionately known as the \"Alfetta,\" taking the top three positions. Giuseppe \"Nino\" Farina, a skilled and fearless driver, emerged victorious, etching his name in history as the first winner of a Formula 1 World Championship race. The 1950 championship was a European affair, with races held at iconic circuits like Monaco, Spa-Francorchamps, and Monza. It was a season dominated by Alfa Romeo, but it also saw the emergence of Ferrari as a serious contender, with the legendary Alberto Ascari showcasing his immense talent.\n\nYet, amid the dominance of these titans, the spirit of the underdog was never far away. Smaller teams, often operating on shoestring budgets, dared to dream and occasionally tasted victory. The story of Vanwall, a British team that rose to prominence in the late 1950s, is a testament to this spirit. Founded by industrialist Tony Vandervell, Vanwall took on the might of Ferrari and Maserati, eventually winning the first-ever Constructors' Championship in 1958, a watershed moment that underscored the rising power of British engineering and innovation. Their story was one of David versus Goliath, a small team with limited resources taking on the established giants and, against all odds, succeeding.\n\nThese early years of Formula 1 were not just about the cars and the races; they were about the people. The drivers of this era were a unique breed, men of immense courage and skill who raced with little regard for their own safety. The cars were powerful and unforgiving, and the tracks were often dangerous, lacking the safety features that are taken for granted today. Fatalities were a grim reality, and every driver knew the risks they faced each time they strapped themselves into their machines.\n\nThe psychological makeup of these early drivers was as fascinating as their driving skills. They were men who thrived on the edge, who possessed an extraordinary ability to focus, to control their fear, and to make split-second decisions at breakneck speeds. They were driven by a fierce desire to win, by a passion for the sport, and by a willingness to accept the ultimate risk in pursuit of victory. The mental and emotional toll on these drivers was immense, yet they persevered, pushing themselves and their machines to the limit. They were pioneers, forging a new path in the world of motorsport, and their legacy continues to inspire drivers and fans alike.\n\nThe post-war era was a defining period for Formula 1. It was a time of rapid innovation, of fierce competition, and of extraordinary human endeavor. From the ashes of war rose a sport that would capture the world's imagination, a sport that embodied the spirit of a new age. The origins of Formula 1 were humble, but the seeds sown in those early years would grow into a global phenomenon, a testament to the enduring power of human passion, ingenuity, and the relentless pursuit of speed. This was the dawn of a new era in motorsport, an era of legends, of rivalries, and of breathtaking moments that would forever be etched in the annals of racing history. The story of Formula 1 had begun, and the world was watching, captivated by the roar of the engines and the thrill of the race.\n"
