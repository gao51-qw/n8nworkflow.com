## How It Works
This workflow automates end-to-end financial transaction processing for finance teams managing high-volume bank data. It eliminates manual reconciliation by intelligently classifying transactions, detecting anomalies, and generating executive summaries. The system pulls transaction data from Fable Bank, routes it through multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT-4, NVIDIA NIM) for classification and analysis, reconciles accounts, and distributes formatted reports via email. Finance managers and accounting teams benefit from reduced processing time, improved accuracy, and real-time anomaly detection. The workflow handles transaction categorization, reconciliation schema generation, account matching, journal entry creation, and comprehensive reporting—transforming hours of manual work into minutes of automated processing with AI-enhanced accuracy.
