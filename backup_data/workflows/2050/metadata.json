You can get it by following these steps:\n1. Visit [songkick.com](https://www.songkick.com/) and enter the city name in the search box:\n\t![Songkick search](https://i.imgur.com/lNwGG9p.png)\n    \n2. From the results page, click the result that contains the location info. These will have the `Location` tag on top of the location name:\n    ![Location result example](https://i.imgur.com/vMQJTbL.png)\n3. Once on the location page, copy the url\n    ![URL copy example](https://i.imgur.com/GErLksA.png)\n4. Back in the n8n workflow page, paste the url in the _location_ parameter of the node called _Setup location and email_:\n    ![URL in node settings](https://i.imgur.com/ZwUucrt.png)\n\nSecond thing it needs is the email address which will receive the monthly list. For this, simply enter it in the _email_ field of the _Setup location and email_ node. If you want to set multiple receivers, simply separate email addresses by `,`:\n![Emails in node settings](https://i.imgur.com/3XGkrsD.png)\n\n# Required accounts\nThis workflow requires you to have a properly set up Gmail account that will be used by Gmail Node to send emails. You can read more about how to create credentials for a Gmail node in n8n documentation [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/oauth-single-service/?utm_source=n8n_app&utm_medium=left_nav_menu&utm_campaign=create_new_credentials_modal).",
