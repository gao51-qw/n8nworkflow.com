  "description": "---\n\n**Use cases are many:** Manage your Gmail inbox, schedule calendar events, and handle contact details — all from one central AI-powered assistant. Perfect for freelancers managing clients, agency owners who need streamlined communication, or busy professionals who want a personal AI secretary handling their email and calendar.\n\n---\n\n**Good to know**\nAt time of writing, each Gemini request is billed per token. See [Gemini Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for the latest info.\nThe workflow requires Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, and Telegram integrations. Ensure you’ve set up OAuth2 credentials correctly before running.\n\n---\n\n**How it works**\n\n* **Triggers**: The workflow listens for **new Gmail messages** or **Telegram commands**.\n* **Smart AI Processing**: Incoming emails are summarized, classified (Client, Sponsorship, or Not Business), and labeled automatically.\n* **Auto-Replies**: Depending on classification, the assistant sends pre-written replies (e.g., client acknowledgment, sponsorship rates, or polite rejection).\n* **Calendar Management**: Through natural language requests in Telegram, you can schedule, update, or delete calendar events with conflict-checking in place.\n* **Contact Handling**: If you send an email to someone not yet in your database, the agent will prompt you for their email, add it to Google Sheets, and reuse it for future tasks.\n* **Memory**: The AI maintains conversation context, so repeated tasks feel seamless and natural.\n\n---\n\n**How to use**\n\n* Send commands via Telegram like:\n  *“Schedule a meeting with Sarah on Monday at 3 PM”*\n  *“Send an email to David about the proposal”*\n* Watch as the assistant checks your calendar, sends emails, and keeps your contacts updated — all automatically.\n\n---\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* Gmail account (with labels created for *Client*, *Sponsorship Request*, and *Not Business*)\n* Google Calendar for scheduling\n* Google Sheets for contact management\n* Google Gemini API key\n* Telegram bot for live interaction\n\n---\n\n**Customising this workflow**\n\nYou can expand it to:\n\n* Handle **Slack or WhatsApp** messages in addition to Telegram.\n* Add more **classification categories** (e.g., Invoices, Personal, Leads).\n* Extend auto-replies with **dynamic templates** stored in Google Sheets.\n* Log all interactions to **Notion or Airtable** for a CRM-style history of communications.\n\n---\n\n👉 [Rakin Jakaria](https://www.youtube.com/@RakinJakaria)\n",
