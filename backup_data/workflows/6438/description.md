# 🧠 Browsing History Automation Analyzer – Automation Toolkit (Google Sheets + AI)

This **n8n workflow** analyzes your browsing history to identify opportunities for automation. It reads history from a Google Sheet, groups visits by domain, filters out irrelevant entries, and uses AI to recommend what can be automated — including how and why.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- 📄 **Reads** your browsing history from Google Sheets
- 🌐 **Groups** history by domain
- 🚫 **Filters out** common non-actionable domains (e.g., YouTube, Google)
- 🤖 **Uses AI** to analyze whether your activity on each site is automatable
- 💡 **Provides suggestions** including what to automate, how to do it, and which tools to use
- 📝 **Saves results** into a new tab in the same Google Sheet
- 🔍 **Searches for n8n workflow templates** related to the suggested automation

- **Sheet: `history`** → Input browsing history
- **Sheet: `automations`** → Output AI automation suggestions

## 🧠 AI Analysis Logic

The AI agent receives each domain's browsing history and responds with:
- `domain`: The website domain
- `automatable`: true/false
- `what_to_automate`: Specific actions that can be automated
- `reason`: Why it's suitable (or not) for automation
- `tool`: Suggested automation tool (e.g., n8n, Apify)
- `automation_rating`: High, Medium, Low, or Not Automatable
- `n8n_template`: Relevant automation template (if found)
