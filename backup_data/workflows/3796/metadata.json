  "description": "### How it works:\n\nWhenever a new event is scheduled on your Google Calendar, this workflow generates a Meeting Briefing email, giving an overview of each person on the call and the company they work for.\n\nIt makes use of the [web search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search?api-mode=responses) tool on the OpenAI Responses API to make lookups.\n\nThe workflow triggers when a new event is added to the calendar, loops over each attendee, generating reports on each person and their company, collates the results, and sends the briefing as an email.\n\n### Set up steps:\n\n- Add your credentials for Google Calendar (for viewing events) and Gmail (to send the email)\n- Add your OpenAI credentials as a Header Auth on the Company Search and Person Search nodes.\n\t- Name: Authorization\n\t- Value: Bearer {{ YOUR_API_KEY }}\n- Edit the \"Edit Fields\" node with the email that you want to send the briefing to, and a short bit of context about yourself.",
