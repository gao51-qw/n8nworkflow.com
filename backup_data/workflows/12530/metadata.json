  "description": "# Meeting → Proposal → Payment → Follow-up Automation\n\nCategories: Sales Automation, AI Proposals, Revenue Ops\n\nThis workflow automatically turns a booked sales call into a customized proposal, a Stripe payment link, and a follow-up email — without manual work.\n\nIt’s designed to handle everything *after* a sales call so momentum doesn’t die.\n\nBooked call → proposal → payment → done.\n\n---\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nThis automation runs the moment a sales call is booked and executes a complete post-call sales flow:\n\n- Looks up the lead in a lightweight CRM\n- Generates a tailored proposal using AI\n- Creates a Google Slides proposal deck\n- Creates a unique Stripe checkout link\n- Sends a personalized follow-up email with proposal + payment\n\nNo manual copy-pasting. No delays. No forgotten follow-ups.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Exists\n\nMost deals are lost **after** the call — not during it.\n\nThis system removes:\n- Manual proposal writing\n- Post-call follow-up delays\n- Inconsistent sales ops\n- Awkward “just following up” emails\n\nIt replaces all of that with a single, reliable close flow.\n\nHuman on the outside. Fully automated underneath.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works (High Level)\n\n### 1. Calendly Trigger (Sales Call Booked)\n- Workflow starts immediately after a meeting is scheduled\n- Ensures proposals are sent while context is still fresh\n\n### 2. CRM Lookup (Google Sheets)\n- Finds the lead using email or company name\n- Works even if the lead is unqualified or incomplete\n- Simple, transparent CRM (no heavy tooling required)\n\n### 3. AI Proposal Generation\n- Uses structured inputs (problem, solution, scope, urgency, cost)\n- Outputs a complete proposal as strict JSON\n- Written in a clear, spartan, professional tone\n\n### 4. Google Slides Proposal Creation\n- Copies a proposal template\n- Auto-fills all sections using AI output\n- Generates one unique proposal per lead\n- Shareable link created automatically\n\n### 5. Stripe Checkout Session\n- Creates a unique payment link per lead\n- Attaches metadata (lead, company, package)\n- No manual invoicing required\n\n### 6. Follow-up Email\n- Sends proposal + payment link immediately\n- Personalized with name and company\n- Keeps the close frictionless\n\n---\n\n## Tools Used\n\n- **n8n** — workflow orchestration  \n- **OpenAI** — proposal generation  \n- **Google Sheets** — lightweight CRM  \n- **Google Slides** — proposal delivery  \n- **Stripe** — payment collection  \n- **Email (Gmail / SMTP)** — follow-up delivery  \n- **Calendly** — trigger source  \n\n---\n\n## Who This Is For\n\n- Automation & no-code agencies  \n- Consultants and service businesses  \n- Freelancers selling repeatable offers  \n- Sales-led teams that want speed + consistency  \n- Anyone tired of manual proposals and follow-ups  \n\n---\n\n## Customization Notes\n\n- Swap Google Sheets for Airtable, HubSpot, or Notion\n- Proposal tone and structure are fully prompt-driven\n- Stripe metadata can be extended for analytics or CRM sync\n- Can support multiple triggers (Calendly, forms, manual intake)\n\n---\n\n## Difficulty & Cost\n\n- **Difficulty:** Intermediate (conceptually simple, operationally solid)\n- **Estimated setup time:** 30–45 minutes\n- **Ongoing cost:** OpenAI + Stripe fees only\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is not just a proposal generator.\n\nIt’s a **post-call revenue system** that turns intent into action automatically.\n\n&gt; Meeting → proposal → payment → follow-up  \n&gt; No manual steps. No dropped balls.",
