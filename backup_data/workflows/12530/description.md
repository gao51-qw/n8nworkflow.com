# Meeting → Proposal → Payment → Follow-up Automation

Categories: Sales Automation, AI Proposals, Revenue Ops

This workflow automatically turns a booked sales call into a customized proposal, a Stripe payment link, and a follow-up email — without manual work.

It’s designed to handle everything *after* a sales call so momentum doesn’t die.

Booked call → proposal → payment → done.

## What This Workflow Does

This automation runs the moment a sales call is booked and executes a complete post-call sales flow:

- Looks up the lead in a lightweight CRM
- Generates a tailored proposal using AI
- Creates a Google Slides proposal deck
- Creates a unique Stripe checkout link
- Sends a personalized follow-up email with proposal + payment

No manual copy-pasting. No delays. No forgotten follow-ups.

## Why This Exists

Most deals are lost **after** the call — not during it.

This system removes:
- Manual proposal writing
- Post-call follow-up delays
- Inconsistent sales ops
- Awkward “just following up” emails

It replaces all of that with a single, reliable close flow.

Human on the outside. Fully automated underneath.

## How It Works (High Level)

### 1. Calendly Trigger (Sales Call Booked)
- Workflow starts immediately after a meeting is scheduled
- Ensures proposals are sent while context is still fresh

### 2. CRM Lookup (Google Sheets)
- Finds the lead using email or company name
- Works even if the lead is unqualified or incomplete
- Simple, transparent CRM (no heavy tooling required)

### 3. AI Proposal Generation
- Uses structured inputs (problem, solution, scope, urgency, cost)
- Outputs a complete proposal as strict JSON
- Written in a clear, spartan, professional tone

### 4. Google Slides Proposal Creation
- Copies a proposal template
- Auto-fills all sections using AI output
- Generates one unique proposal per lead
- Shareable link created automatically

### 5. Stripe Checkout Session
- Creates a unique payment link per lead
- Attaches metadata (lead, company, package)
- No manual invoicing required

### 6. Follow-up Email
- Sends proposal + payment link immediately
- Personalized with name and company
- Keeps the close frictionless
