# Query PostgreSQL database with natural language using Groq AI chatbot

> This guide shows you how to deploy a chatbot that lets you query your **PostgreSQL** database using natural language. You will build a system that accepts chat messages, retains conversation history, constructs dynamic SQL queries, and returns responses generated by an AI model. By following these instructions, you will have a working solution that integrates n8n’s AI Agent capabilities with **PostgreSQL**.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

* An active n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud) running version 1.50.0 or later.
* Valid **PostgreSQL** credentials configured in n8n.
* API credentials for the Groq Chat Model (or your preferred AI language model).
* Basic familiarity with SQL (specifically **PostgreSQL** syntax) and n8n node concepts such as chat triggers and memory buffers.
* Access to the n8n Docs on AI Agents for further reference.

### Workflow Setup

1.  **Chat Interface & Trigger**
    * **When Chat Message Received:** This node listens for incoming chat messages via a webhook. When a message arrives, it triggers the workflow immediately.

2.  **Conversation Memory**
    * **Chat History:** This memory buffer node stores the last 10 interactions. It supplies conversation context to the AI Agent, ensuring that responses consider previous messages.

3.  **AI Agent Core**
    * **AI Agent (Tools Agent):** The AI Agent node orchestrates the conversation by receiving the chat input and conversation history. It dynamically generates **PostgreSQL**-compatible SQL queries based on your requests and coordinates calls to external tools (such as **PostgreSQL** nodes).

4.  **Database Interactions**
    * **PostgreSQL Node (Query Execution):** This node executes the SQL query generated by the AI Agent against your **PostgreSQL** database. You reference the query using an expression (e.g., `{{$node["AI Agent"].json.sql_query}}`), allowing the agent’s output to control data retrieval.
    * **PostgreSQL Node (Schema Retrieval):** This node (or a dedicated step using the **PostgreSQL** node) retrieves a list of relevant tables from your **PostgreSQL** database (e.g., from the `public` schema, excluding system schemas like `pg_catalog` or `information_schema`). The agent uses this information to understand the available tables. This typically involves executing a query like `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';`.
    * **PostgreSQL Node (Table Definition Retrieval):** This node (or another dedicated step using the **PostgreSQL** node) fetches detailed metadata (such as column names, data types, and potentially relationships using foreign keys) for a specific table. The table name (and schema if necessary) is supplied dynamically by the AI Agent. This often involves querying `information_schema.columns`, e.g., `SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = '{{dynamic_table_name}}' AND table_schema = 'public';`.

5.  **Language Model Processing**
    * **Groq Chat Model:** This node connects to the Groq Chat API to generate text completions. It processes the combined input (chat message, context, and data fetched from **PostgreSQL**) and produces the final response.

6.  **Guidance & Customization**
    * **Sticky Notes:** These nodes provide guidance on:
        * Switching the chat model if you wish to use another provider (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic).
        * Adjusting the maximum token count per interaction.
        * Customizing the SQL queries (ensuring **PostgreSQL** compatibility) and the context window size.
    * They help you modify the workflow to suit your environment and requirements.

### Workflow Connections

* The **Chat Trigger** passes the incoming message to the **AI Agent**.
* The **Chat History** node supplies conversation context to the AI Agent.
* The **AI Agent** calls the **PostgreSQL** nodes as external tools, generating and sending dynamic SQL queries.
* The **Groq Chat Model** processes the consolidated input from the agent and outputs the natural language response delivered to the user.

### Testing the Workflow

1.  Send a chat message using the chat interface.
2.  Observe how the AI Agent processes the input and generates a corresponding **PostgreSQL** SQL query.
3.  Verify that the **PostgreSQL** nodes execute the query correctly against your database and return data.
4.  Confirm that the Groq Chat Model produces a coherent natural language response based on the query results.
5.  Refer to the sticky notes for guidance if you need to fine-tune any node settings or SQL queries.

### Next Steps and References

* **Customize Your AI Model:** Replace the Groq Chat Model with another language model (such as the OpenAI Chat Model) by updating the node credentials and configuration.
* **Enhance Memory Settings:** Adjust the Chat History node’s context window to retain more or fewer messages based on your needs.
* **Modify SQL Queries:** Update the SQL queries within the **PostgreSQL** nodes or refine the prompts for the AI Agent to ensure they match your specific database schema and desired data, adhering to **PostgreSQL** syntax.
* **Further Reading:** Consult the n8n Docs on AI Agents for additional details and examples to expand your workflow’s capabilities.
* **Set Up a Website Chatbot:** Copy & Paste and replace the placeholders in the following code to embed the chatbot into your personal or company’s website: [View in CodePen 🡥](https://codepen.io/olemai/pen/RNwPdVp)

By following these steps, you will deploy a robust AI chatbot workflow that integrates with your **PostgreSQL** database, allowing you to query data using natural language.
