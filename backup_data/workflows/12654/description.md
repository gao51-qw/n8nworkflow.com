### **How It Works**

This workflow automates the complete process of scraping Trustpilot reviews, extracting structured data, analyzing sentiment, and generating comprehensive reports. The workflow follows this sequence:

1. **Trigger & Configuration**: The workflow starts with a manual trigger, allowing users to set the target company URL and the number of review pages to scrape.

2. **Review Scraping**: An HTTP request node fetches review pages from Trustpilot with pagination support, extracting review links from the HTML content.

3. **Review Processing**: The workflow processes individual review pages in batches (limited to 5 reviews per execution for efficiency). Each review page is converted to clean markdown using ScrapegraphAI.

4. **Data Extraction**: An information extractor using OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini model parses the markdown to extract structured review data including author, rating, date, title, text, review count, and country.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Another OpenAI model performs sentiment classification on each review text, categorizing it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

6. **Data Aggregation**: Processed reviews are collected and compiled into a structured dataset.

7. **Analytics & Visualization**:
   - A pie chart is generated showing sentiment distribution
   - A comprehensive reputation analysis report is created using an AI agent that evaluates company-level insights, recurring themes, and provides actionable recommendations

8. **Reporting & Delivery**: The analysis is converted to HTML format and sent via email, providing stakeholders with immediate insights into customer feedback and company reputation.

## **Set Up Steps**

To configure and run this workflow:

1. **Credential Setup**:
   - Configure OpenAI API credentials for the chat models and information extraction
   - Set up ScrapegraphAI credentials for webpage-to-markdown conversion
   - Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials for email notifications

2. **Company Configuration**:
   - In the "Set Parameters" node, update `company_id` to the target Trustpilot company URL 
   - Adjust `max_page` to control how many review pages to scrape

3. **Review Processing Limits**:
   - The "Limit" node restricts processing to 5 reviews per execution to manage API costs and processing time
   - Adjust this value based on your needs and OpenAI usage limits

4. **Email Configuration**:
   - Update the "Send a message" node with the recipient email address
   - Customize the email subject and content as needed

5. **Analysis Customization**:
   - Modify the prompt in the "Company Reputation Analyst" node to tailor the report format
   - Adjust sentiment analysis categories if different classification is needed

6. **Execution**:
   - Click "Test workflow" to execute the manual trigger
   - Monitor execution in the n8n editor to ensure all API calls succeed
   - Check the configured email inbox for the generated report

**Note**: Be mindful of API rate limits and costs associated with OpenAI and ScrapegraphAI services when processing large numbers of reviews. The workflow includes a 5-second delay between paginated requests to comply with Trustpilot's terms of service.
