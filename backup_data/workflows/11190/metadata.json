  "description": "# AI Creative Director: Transform Phone Photos into Viral Ad Campaigns\n\n## Description\nTurn amateur product snapshots into high-conversion advertising assets automatically. This agentic workflow acts as your personal Art Director. Simply send a photo to a Telegram bot, and the AI will analyze the image, conceptualize 3 distinct marketing angles, and generate professional-grade commercial photography.\n\n## How it Works\n1. **Ingest:** Receives a photo and user caption via Telegram.\n2. **Analyze:** Uses **Gemini Vision** to understand the product and critique the original image quality.\n3. **Ideate:** A **LangChain Agent** (powered by Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter) acts as a Creative Director to brainstorm 3 unique ad concepts (e.g., Cyberpunk, Luxury, Minimalist).\n4. **Create:** Generates high-fidelity images using the **Gemini 3 Pro** API.\n5. **Deliver:** Sends the new ad creatives back to you on Telegram.\n\n## Key Features\n* **Multi-Modal Pipeline:** Chains Vision models (Gemini) with Reasoning models (Claude) for superior context awareness.\n* **Structured Output:** Uses LangChain's Structured Output Parser to ensure consistent JSON formats.\n* **Secure Configuration:** Features a centralized `CONFIG` node to easily manage API keys and user IDs without editing complex logic.\n* **Visual Verification:** Includes an authentication check to ensure only *you* (the authorized user) can trigger the bot.\n\n## Prerequisites\n* **n8n Version:** 1.0+ (requires LangChain nodes).\n* **Telegram:** A Bot Token and your personal User ID.\n* **Google Cloud:** An API Key with access to Gemini models.\n* **OpenRouter:** An API Key for accessing Claude Sonnet (or your preferred LLM).\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1. **Import the Workflow:** Paste the JSON into your n8n canvas.\n2. **Open the `CONFIG` Node:** Locate the green node at the start of the workflow.\n3. **Enter Credentials:**\n   * `authorized_user_id`: Your numeric Telegram User ID (to prevent strangers from using your API credits).\n   * `telegram_bot_token`: Your Bot Father token.\n   * `google_api_key`: Your Gemini API key.\n4. **Activate:** Toggle the workflow to \"Active\" and send a photo to your bot!\n\n## Tags\n#AI #LangChain #Gemini #Telegram #Marketing #Agent #ImageGeneration #OpenRouter",
