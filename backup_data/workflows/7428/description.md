**What this workflow does**
---------------------------

-   Pulls free security/tech headlines from multiple RSS feeds (e.g., CISA, BleepingComputer, Krebs, SecurityWeek, Ars Technica, TechCrunch, Hacker News).

-   De-duplicates stories, keeps only the last 24 hours, and limits to a manageable number.

-   Uses OpenAI to write a concise brief with sections and "Why it matters."

-   Sends a clean HTML email via Gmail.

-   A few free RSS feed URLs (swap in/out as you like)

* * * * *

**Set up steps**
----------------

-   Trigger -- Add a Cron to run daily (pick your time and timezone).
-   Fetch -- Add one RSS Read node per source and connect all to a Merge (append).
-   De-duplicate (this run) -- Add Remove Duplicates and compare on a stable key (prefer the article URL).
-   Freshness -- Add an IF to pass only items published in the last 24 hours.
-   Limit -- Add Limit to cap the total items (e.g., 25).
-   Summarize -- Add OpenAI → Message a model to produce a JSON brief with subject + HTML body.
-   Email -- Add Gmail → Send to deliver the brief to your inbox.

**Tips & troubleshooting**
--------------------------

-   If everything gets discarded at de-dup e while testing, switch to "within current input" or reset the node's stored values.
-   If no items pass the IF, widen the date window temporarily (some feeds publish late).
-   If the email arrives blank, ensure Gmail email type is set to HTML and the subject/body fields map to the model's output.
