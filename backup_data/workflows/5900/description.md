# 🖼️ Text-to-Image Generator using n8n + Flux AI

This n8n workflow automates image generation from text prompts using the [Text-to-Image Flux AI API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/text-to-image-flux-ai). It reads prompts from Google Sheets, generates images via API, uploads them to Google Drive, and logs the outcome.

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Prompt`          | The text prompt to generate an image from        |
| `drive path`      | (Optional) File path or URL of saved image       |
