### Eventbrite → Pipedrive Lead‑Sync

Bring your Eventbrite attendee data into Pipedrive automatically—no spreadsheets, CSVs, or manual uploads.

#### 🚀  What the Workflow Does
- **Polls Eventbrite** on a schedule (default 30 min) for *new* registrations.  
- **Creates or updates** matching **Person** and **Deal** records in Pipedrive.  
- **Deduplicates** by email and stores a timestamp so each attendee is processed only once.  
- **Easily configurable** field‑mapping lets you decide exactly which attendee data lands in Pipedrive.
