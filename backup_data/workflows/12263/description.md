Generate complete illustrated stories using AI. This workflow creates engaging narratives with custom DALL-E 3 images for each scene and saves everything to Firebase.

**How it works**
1. User fills out a form with story topic, language, art style, and number of scenes
2. GPT-4 generates a complete story with scenes, characters, and image prompts
3. DALL-E 3 creates unique illustrations for each scene
4. Images are uploaded to Firebase Storage for permanent hosting
5. Complete story data is saved to Firestore
6. Returns JSON with the full story and image URLs
