## 📌 AI Agent via GoHighLevel SMS with Website-Based Knowledgebase

- Scraping the company's website at set intervals to update the knowledgebase.
- Integrating with GoHighLevel SMS to provide users with timely and accurate information.
- Utilizing AI to interpret user queries and fetch relevant information from the updated knowledgebase.
