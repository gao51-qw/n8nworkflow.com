  "title": "Backup your workflows to GitHub -- in (subfolders)",
  "description": "Based on [Jonathan](https://n8n.io/creators/jon-n8n) & [Solomon](https://n8n.io/creators/solomon) work.\n\n&gt; The only addition I've made is a Set node. This node organizes workflows into subfolders within the GitHub repository based on their respective tags.\n\n#### How it works\nThis workflow will backup your workflows to GitHub. It uses the n8n API node to export all workflows.\n\nIt then loops over the data, checks in GitHub to see if a file exists that uses the credential's ID. Once checked it will:\n- update the file on GitHub if it exists;\n- create a new file if it doesn't exist;\n- ignore if it's the same.\n\n#### Who is this for?\nPeople wanting to backup their workflows outside the server for safety purposes or to migrate to another server.\n\n",
