# Daily positive news digest with OpenAI and Gmail

> **How it works**

Start every morning on a positive note! This workflow automates delivering a curated summary of positive news directly to your mailbox. It automatically:

- Fetches the latest articles from a dedicated "good news" source (like Good News Network) every morning.

- Uses Artificial Intelligence to summarize each positive article concisely.

- Compiles these summaries into a clear and uplifting daily digest.

- Sends the daily digest to your specified email address.

Say goodbye to doomscrolling and hello to your dose of daily inspiration!

**Set up steps**

Setting up this workflow is straightforward, typically taking around 10-15 minutes. You'll need to:

- Authenticate your preferred email service (e.g., Gmail).

- Obtain an API key for your chosen AI service (e.g., OpenAI).

All detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.
