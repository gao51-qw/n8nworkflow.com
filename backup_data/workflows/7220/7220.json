    "description": "### **Automated Support Ticket & Customer Notification System**\n\nLet's build this workflow to streamline your customer support. Here is a detailed, node-by-node explanation of how it works and how to set it up in n8n.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\nThis workflow transforms your support inbox into a structured ticket system. When a new email arrives at your support address, the system automatically creates a new ticket (e.g., a Trello card), sends an instant confirmation email to the customer, and notifies your support team. This ensures every customer inquiry is captured, organized, and confirmed, guaranteeing no request gets missed.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### **1. Gmail Trigger: Watch Support Inbox**\n* **Node Type:** `Gmail Trigger`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Watch for New Mails`\n    * **Folder:** `Inbox` (or a specific folder for support emails, like `Support`)\n    * **To:** `your-support-email@example.com`\n* **Explanation:** This node is the starting point. It connects to your support email address and listens for new messages. As soon as a new email arrives, it triggers the rest of the workflow.\n\n#### **2. Trello: Create New Support Ticket**\n* **Node Type:** `Trello`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_TRELLO_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Create Card`\n    * **Board ID:** `YOUR_SUPPORT_BOARD_ID`\n    * **List ID:** `YOUR_INCOMING_LIST_ID` (e.g., \"New Tickets\")\n    * **Name:** `New Support Request from {{ $json.from }}`\n    * **Description:** `Subject: {{ $json.subject }} Body: {{ $json.body }}`\n* **Explanation:** This node takes the details from the incoming email and creates a new card on your Trello board. This turns every email into an actionable, trackable ticket for your support team.\n\n#### **3. Gmail: Send Automatic Confirmation**\n* **Node Type:** `Gmail`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Send`\n    * **To:** `={{ $json.from }}`\n    * **Subject:** `Re: {{ $json.subject }}`\n    * **Body:** `Hi there, thanks for reaching out. We've received your request and have created a new ticket. Our team will get back to you shortly.`\n* **Explanation:** This node sends a quick, professional, and automated email back to the customer. This provides immediate peace of mind for the customer and confirms that their inquiry was successfully received.\n\n#### **4. Slack: Notify Support Team (Optional)**\n* **Node Type:** `Slack`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_SLACK_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Post Message`\n    * **Channel:** `YOUR_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID` (e.g., `#support-channel`)\n    * **Text:** `*New Support Ticket!* A new ticket from *{{ $json.from }}* has been created in Trello.`\n* **Explanation:** This optional but recommended node sends a real-time notification to your support team on Slack, letting them know that a new ticket is waiting for their attention.\n\n### **Final Step: Activation**\n\n1.  After configuring the nodes and connecting all credentials, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Click the **\"Active\"** toggle in the top-right corner. The workflow is now live!\n3.  **Note:** You can easily swap out the `Trello` node with a `Zendesk` or `Jira` node, and the `Slack` node with a `Telegram` or `Microsoft Teams` node, depending on your team's tools.",

            "content": "# Workflow Note: Automated Support Ticket & Customer Notification System\n\n---\n\n### **Problem**\nUnorganized support emails are a major source of friction for small to medium-sized businesses. Without a proper system, customer inquiries can get lost, leading to delayed response times and customer frustration. The lack of an automated confirmation for the customer leaves them in the dark, which can severely damage trust and brand reputation.\n\n### **Solution**\nThis is a straightforward but powerful n8n workflow designed to professionalize your customer support process. By integrating your support email with a project management or ticketing tool, the system ensures that every incoming support email is automatically converted into a trackable ticket. Simultaneously, it sends an instant, personalized confirmation email to the customer, providing them with peace of mind that their request has been received and is being handled.\n\n### **For Whom**\nThis workflow is ideal for **small businesses, e-commerce stores, and startups** that are growing their customer base and need a simple, effective way to manage support inquiries. It's a perfect solution for teams that want to transition from a messy shared inbox to an organized, responsive ticketing system without investing in an expensive, complex platform.\n\n### **Scope**\n* **What it includes:**\n    * An instant trigger for every new email sent to your support inbox.\n    * Automatic creation of a new ticket (e.g., a Trello card) with all the email details.\n    * An immediate, automated email reply to the customer confirming their message was received.\n    * Optional real-time notifications to your support team on Slack.\n\n* **What it excludes:**\n    * Advanced ticket routing or assignment logic.\n    * Automated follow-up sequences.\n    * Integration with a knowledge base or FAQ system.\n\n### **How to Set Up**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need an n8n instance and accounts for **Gmail**, **Trello** (or a similar tool), and optionally **Slack**.\n2.  **Workflow Import:** Import the workflow's `.json` file into your n8n instance.\n3.  **Credential Configuration:**\n    * Set up credentials for **Gmail**, **Trello**, and **Slack** within n8n.\n4.  **Node-Specific Configuration:**\n    * **`Gmail Trigger`:** Specify the email address that will be monitored for new support requests.\n    * **`Trello` Node:** Enter your `Board ID` and the `List ID` where you want new tickets to be created.\n    * **`Gmail` Node:** Customize the automated confirmation email's subject and body to reflect your brand's voice.\n    * **`Slack` Node (Optional):** Enter the `Channel ID` for your support team's communication channel.\n5.  **Activation:** After all configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** and then **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically manage your support inquiries."
