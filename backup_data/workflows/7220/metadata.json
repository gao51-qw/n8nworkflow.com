  "description": "### **Automated Support Ticket & Customer Notification System**\n\nLet's build this workflow to streamline your customer support. Here is a detailed, node-by-node explanation of how it works and how to set it up in n8n.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\nThis workflow transforms your support inbox into a structured ticket system. When a new email arrives at your support address, the system automatically creates a new ticket (e.g., a Trello card), sends an instant confirmation email to the customer, and notifies your support team. This ensures every customer inquiry is captured, organized, and confirmed, guaranteeing no request gets missed.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n#### **1. Gmail Trigger: Watch Support Inbox**\n* **Node Type:** `Gmail Trigger`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Watch for New Mails`\n    * **Folder:** `Inbox` (or a specific folder for support emails, like `Support`)\n    * **To:** `your-support-email@example.com`\n* **Explanation:** This node is the starting point. It connects to your support email address and listens for new messages. As soon as a new email arrives, it triggers the rest of the workflow.\n\n#### **2. Trello: Create New Support Ticket**\n* **Node Type:** `Trello`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_TRELLO_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Create Card`\n    * **Board ID:** `YOUR_SUPPORT_BOARD_ID`\n    * **List ID:** `YOUR_INCOMING_LIST_ID` (e.g., \"New Tickets\")\n    * **Name:** `New Support Request from {{ $json.from }}`\n    * **Description:** `Subject: {{ $json.subject }} Body: {{ $json.body }}`\n* **Explanation:** This node takes the details from the incoming email and creates a new card on your Trello board. This turns every email into an actionable, trackable ticket for your support team.\n\n#### **3. Gmail: Send Automatic Confirmation**\n* **Node Type:** `Gmail`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Send`\n    * **To:** `={{ $json.from }}`\n    * **Subject:** `Re: {{ $json.subject }}`\n    * **Body:** `Hi there, thanks for reaching out. We've received your request and have created a new ticket. Our team will get back to you shortly.`\n* **Explanation:** This node sends a quick, professional, and automated email back to the customer. This provides immediate peace of mind for the customer and confirms that their inquiry was successfully received.\n\n#### **4. Slack: Notify Support Team (Optional)**\n* **Node Type:** `Slack`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_SLACK_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Post Message`\n    * **Channel:** `YOUR_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID` (e.g., `#support-channel`)\n    * **Text:** `*New Support Ticket!* A new ticket from *{{ $json.from }}* has been created in Trello.`\n* **Explanation:** This optional but recommended node sends a real-time notification to your support team on Slack, letting them know that a new ticket is waiting for their attention.\n\n### **Final Step: Activation**\n\n1.  After configuring the nodes and connecting all credentials, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Click the **\"Active\"** toggle in the top-right corner. The workflow is now live!\n3.  **Note:** You can easily swap out the `Trello` node with a `Zendesk` or `Jira` node, and the `Slack` node with a `Telegram` or `Microsoft Teams` node, depending on your team's tools.",
