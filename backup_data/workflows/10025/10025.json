Built with n8n, Claude AI, Telegram approval, and Notion database integration.\n\n![image.png](fileId:3035)\n\n## ⚠️ Hosting Options\nThis template works with both **n8n Cloud** and **self-hosted** instances. Most nodes are native to n8n, making it cloud-compatible out of the box.\n\n## What This Template Does\n\n**Automated Lead Management Pipeline:**\n- Captures client intake form submissions from website or n8n forms\n- AI-powered classification into HOT/WARM/COLD categories based on budget, project scope, and commitment indicators\n- Generates personalized outreach emails tailored to each lead type\n- Human approval workflow via Telegram for quality control\n- Email revision capability for rejected drafts\n- Automated client email delivery via Gmail\n- Centralized lead tracking in Notion database\n\n## Key Features\n\n✅ **Intelligent Lead Scoring**: Analyzes 12+ data points including budget (AED), space count, project type, timeline, and style preferences\n\n✅ **Personalized Communication**: AI-generated emails reference specific client details, demonstrating genuine understanding\n\n✅ **Quality Control**: Human-in-the-loop approval via Telegram prevents errors before client contact\n\n✅ **Smart Routing**: Different workflows for qualified leads (meeting invitations) vs. unqualified leads (respectful alternatives)\n\n✅ **Revision Loop**: Rejected emails automatically route to revision agent for improvements\n\n✅ **Database Integration**: All leads stored in Notion for pipeline tracking and analytics\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Interior design firms managing high-volume lead intake\n- Architecture practices with complex qualification criteria\n- Home renovation companies prioritizing project value\n- Any service business requiring budget-based lead scoring\n- Sales teams needing approval workflows before client contact\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Required Accounts & API Keys:\n1. **Anthropic Claude API** - For AI classification and email generation\n2. **Telegram Bot Token** - For approval notifications\n3. **Gmail Account** - For sending client emails (or any SMTP provider)\n4. **Notion Account** - For lead database storage\n5. **n8n Account** - Cloud or self-hosted instance\n\n### Technical Requirements:\n- Basic understanding of n8n workflows\n- Ability to create Telegram bots via BotFather\n- Gmail app password or OAuth setup\n- Notion database with appropriate properties\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Clone and Import Template\n1. Copy this template to your n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n2. All nodes will appear as inactive - this is normal\n\n### Step 2: Configure Form Trigger\n1. Open the **Client Intake Form Trigger** node\n2. Choose your trigger type:\n   - For n8n forms: Configure form fields matching the template structure\n   - For webhook: Copy webhook URL and integrate with your website form\n3. Required form fields:\n   - First Name, Second Name, Email, Contact Number\n   - Project Address, Project Type, Spaces Included\n   - Budget Range, Completion Date, Style Preferences\n   - Involvement Level, Previous Experience, Inspiration Links\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Claude AI Credentials\n1. Obtain API key from https://console.anthropic.com\n2. In n8n: Create new credential → Anthropic → Paste API key\n3. Apply credential to these nodes:\n   - **AI Lead Scoring Engine**\n   - **Personalized Client Outreach Email Generator**\n   - **Email Revision Agent**\n\n### Step 4: Configure Telegram Approval Bot\n1. Create bot via Telegram's @BotFather\n2. Copy bot token\n3. Get your Telegram Chat ID (use @userinfobot)\n4. In n8n: Create Telegram credential with bot token\n5. Configure **Human-in-the-Loop Email Approval** node:\n   - Add your Chat ID\n   - Customize approval message format if desired\n\n### Step 5: Set Up Gmail Sending\n1. Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail account\n2. Generate app password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords\n3. In n8n: Create Gmail credential using app password\n4. Configure **Client Email Delivery** node with sender details\n\n### Step 6: Connect Notion Database\n1. Create Notion integration at https://www.notion.so/my-integrations\n2. Copy integration token\n3. Create database with these properties:\n   - Client Name (Title), Email (Email), Contact Number (Phone)\n   - Project Address (Text), Project Type (Multi-select)\n   - Spaces Included (Text), Budget (Select), Timeline (Date)\n   - Classification (Select: HOT/WARM/COLD), Confidence (Select)\n   - Estimated Value (Number), Status (Select)\n4. Share database with your integration\n5. In n8n: Add Notion credential → Paste token\n6. Configure **Notion Lead Database Manager** with database ID\n\n### Step 7: Customize Classification Rules (Optional)\n1. Open **AI Lead Scoring Engine** node\n2. Review classification criteria in the prompt:\n   - HOT: 500k+ AED, full renovations, 2+ spaces\n   - WARM: 100k+ AED, 2+ spaces\n   - COLD: &lt;100k AED OR single space\n3. Adjust thresholds to match your business requirements\n4. Modify currency if not using AED\n\n### Step 8: Personalize Email Templates\n1. Open **Personalized Client Outreach Email Generator** node\n2. Customize:\n   - Company name and branding\n   - Signature placeholders ([Your Name], [Title], etc.)\n   - Tone and style preferences\n   - Alternative designer recommendations for COLD leads\n\n### Step 9: Test the Workflow\n1. Activate the workflow\n2. Submit a test form with sample data\n3. Monitor each node execution in n8n\n4. Check Telegram for approval message\n5. Verify email delivery and Notion database entry\n\n### Step 10: Set Up Error Handling (Recommended)\n1. Add error workflow trigger\n2. Configure notifications for failed executions\n3. Set up retry logic for API failures\n\n## Workflow Node Breakdown\n\n### 1. Client Intake Form Trigger\nCaptures lead data from website forms or n8n native forms with all project details.\n\n### 2. AI Lead Scoring Engine\nAnalyzes intake data using structured logic: budget validation, space counting, and multi-factor evaluation. Returns HOT/WARM/COLD classification with confidence scores.\n\n### 3. Lead Classification Router\nRoutes leads into three priority workflows based on AI classification, optimizing resource allocation.\n\n### 4.

Your task is to analyze client intake form data and classify leads as HOT, WARM, or COLD based on project scope and budget.\n\n## Current Context\n**Current Date & Time**: {{$now}}\n**Timezone**: UAE (GMT+4)\n\n## Classification Criteria\n\n### HOT LEAD 🔥\n**Requirements (ALL must be met):**\n- Project Type includes \"Full Home Renovation\" OR \"New Construction\"\n- Budget is 500,000 AED or higher\n- Minimum 2 distinct spaces/rooms involved\n- Strong indicators of serious commitment\n\n### WARM LEAD 🟡\n**Requirements (must meet ALL of the following):**\n- Minimum 2 distinct spaces/rooms involved in the project\n- Budget of 100,000 AED or higher\n- Shows realistic expectations and planning\n- **DEFAULT CLASSIFICATION**: If uncertain or ambiguous (and not disqualified by COLD criteria), always classify as WARM\n\n### COLD LEAD ❄️\n**Automatic Disqualifiers (if ANY of these are met, lead is COLD):**\n- Budget is below 100,000 AED (AUTOMATIC COLD regardless of other factors)\n- Only 1 single space/room involved (AUTOMATIC COLD regardless of other factors)\n- May indicate exploratory or shopping behavior\n\n**CRITICAL RULE**: Budget < 100,000 AED OR single space = COLD, no exceptions.\n\n## Input Fields to Analyze\n\nYou will receive the following data from the client intake form:\n\n1. **client_names**: Client name(s)\n2. **email**: Email address\n3. **project_address**: Project location\n4. **project_type**: Array of selected project types (New Construction, Full Home Renovation, Single Room Design, E-Design)\n5. **spaces_included**: Text description of rooms/areas\n6. **total_budget**: Selected budget range\n7. **completion_date**: Target timeline\n8. **desired_style**: Style keywords\n9. **dislikes**: Current space problems\n10. **involvement**: Client's preferred involvement level\n11. **previous_experience**: Past designer/contractor experience\n12. **inspiration_link**: Reference links\n\n## Analysis Process\n\n### Step 1: Check Automatic Disqualifiers (FIRST PRIORITY)\n**STOP and classify as COLD immediately if:**\n- Budget < 100,000 AED → COLD (no further analysis needed)\n- Only 1 space/room → COLD (no further analysis needed)\n\nIf either condition is met, skip to COLD classification regardless of any other positive factors.\n\n### Step 2: Parse Budget\n- Note: Budget excludes design fees, so this is their material/labor budget\n- If budget ≥ 100,000 AED, continue to next step\n\n### Step 3: Count Spaces\n- Parse the \"spaces_included\" field\n- Count distinct rooms/areas mentioned\n- Common spaces: Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom, Living Room, Dining Room, Office, etc.\n- Look for plurals like \"All Bathrooms\" (counts as multiple)\n- Be generous in counting - \"Kitchen and adjoining breakfast nook\" = 2 spaces\n- If only 1 space, classify as COLD immediately\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Project Type (only if budget ≥ 100k and spaces ≥ 2)\n- Check if \"Full Home Renovation\" or \"New Construction\" is selected\n- These automatically indicate larger scope\n\n### Step 5: Consider Supporting Factors (only for WARM/HOT determination)\n- Timeline urgency (sooner = hotter)\n- Previous positive experience with designers\n- Detailed, thoughtful responses\n- Clear vision and inspiration provided\n- Involvement level (balanced involvement = more serious)\n\n### Step 6: Apply Classification Logic\n```\nFIRST: Check Automatic Disqualifiers\nIF (budget < 100,000 AED) OR (spaces_included count = 1)\n   THEN classify as COLD\n   → End analysis, skip all other factors\n\nTHEN: Evaluate for HOT\nIF (project_type contains \"Full Home Renovation\" OR \"New Construction\") \n   AND (budget >= 500,000 AED)\n   AND (spaces_included count >= 2)\n   THEN classify as HOT\n\nTHEN: Evaluate for WARM\nIF (spaces_included count >= 2) \n   AND (budget >= 100,000 AED)\n   THEN classify as WARM\n\nELSE \n   DEFAULT to WARM (only when uncertain AND not disqualified)\n```\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your response in the following JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"HOT|WARM|COLD\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High|Medium|Low\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of classification decision\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"Factor 1 that influenced decision\",\n    \"Factor 2 that influenced decision\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"Budget range in AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Next steps for sales team\",\n  \"notes\": \"Any additional observations or red flags\"\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: HOT Lead\n**Input:**\n- project_type: [\"Full Home Renovation\"]\n- spaces_included: \"Kitchen, All Bathrooms, Living Room, Dining Room, Three Bedrooms\"\n- total_budget: [\"Over $250,000\"] (Over 918,000 AED)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"HOT\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Full home renovation with budget over 500,000 AED and multiple spaces involved\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"Full home renovation project type\",\n    \"Budget exceeds 918,000 AED (500,000 AED threshold met)\",\n    \"Comprehensive scope with 8+ spaces\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"918,000+ AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Priority response within 24 hours. Assign senior designer for consultation.\",\n  \"notes\": \"High-value client with realistic budget for scope\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: WARM Lead\n**Input:**\n- project_type: [\"Single Room Design\"]\n- spaces_included: \"Primary Bedroom and Ensuite Bathroom\"\n- total_budget: [\"$100,000 - $250,000\"] (367,000 - 918,000 AED)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"WARM\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Two spaces with solid mid-range budget showing realistic expectations\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"2 connected spaces (bedroom + bathroom)\",\n    \"Budget range of 367,000-918,000 AED is appropriate for scope\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"367,000-918,000 AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Follow up within 48-72 hours. Schedule consultation call.\",\n  \"notes\": \"Good fit for mid-tier design package\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: COLD Lead (Budget < 100k)\n**Input:**\n- project_type: [\"E-Design\"]\n- spaces_included: \"Guest Bedroom\"\n- total_budget: [\"Under $25,000\"] (Under 92,000 AED)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"COLD\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"AUTOMATIC COLD: Budget under 100,000 AED threshold\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"Budget under 92,000 AED (AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIER)\",\n    \"Only 1 space involved (also meets COLD criteria)\",\n    \"E-Design suggests cost-conscious approach\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"Under 92,000 AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Add to nurture email sequence. Offer E-Design package information.\",\n  \"notes\": \"Budget disqualifier met. May be testing services or budget-constrained. Good candidate for digital products.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: COLD Lead (Single Space)\n**Input:**\n- project_type: [\"Single Room Design\"]\n- spaces_included: \"Living Room only\"\n- total_budget: [\"$100,000 - $250,000\"] (367,000 - 918,000 AED)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"COLD\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"AUTOMATIC COLD: Only 1 space involved despite adequate budget\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"Only 1 space involved (AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFIER)\",\n    \"Budget of 367,000-918,000 AED is adequate but overridden by space count rule\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"367,000-918,000 AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Add to nurture sequence. May expand scope later. Low priority follow-up.\",\n  \"notes\": \"Single space project regardless of budget. May be good for junior designer portfolio work.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 5: COLD Lead (Full Home but Low Budget)\n**Input:**\n- project_type: [\"Full Home Renovation\"]\n- spaces_included: \"Kitchen, Living Room, Master Bedroom\"\n- total_budget: [\"$50,000 - $100,000\"] (184,000 - 367,000 AED)\n\n**Output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"lead_classification\": \"COLD\",\n  \"confidence\": \"High\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"AUTOMATIC COLD: Budget below 100,000 AED (using lower end of range)\",\n  \"key_factors\": [\n    \"Budget range starts at 184,000 AED but maximum could be under 100k threshold\",\n    \"Full home renovation with unrealistic budget expectations\",\n    \"3 spaces mentioned but budget is the disqualifying factor\"\n  ],\n  \"estimated_project_value\": \"184,000-367,000 AED\",\n  \"recommended_action\": \"Low priority follow-up. Send budget education materials.\",\n  \"notes\": \"Budget too low for stated scope. Client needs education on realistic renovation costs before qualifying.\"\n}\n```\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. **HARD STOP for budget < 100,000 AED** - Always COLD, no exceptions, no matter what other factors exist\n2. **HARD STOP for single space** - Always COLD, no exceptions, even with high budget\n3. **Check disqualifiers FIRST** - Before analyzing any other factors\n4. **Only default to WARM when NOT disqualified** - WARM is default only for ambiguous cases that pass the basic thresholds\n5. **Be strict with space counting for COLD** - \"1 room\" = COLD, period\n6. **Consider budget ranges carefully** - If range includes values under 100k, lean toward COLD\n7. **Provide actionable insights** - Your classification drives sales team prioritization\n8. **Convert all currencies to AED** - Use the conversion reference for consistency\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Budget range spans 100k threshold** (e.g., 80k-120k): If lower end < 100k, classify as COLD with note about budget uncertainty\n- **Multiple project types selected**: Use the most comprehensive type for classification (AFTER passing disqualifier checks)\n- **\"Full Home\" but vague spaces**: Count conservatively; if can't confirm 2+ spaces, classify as COLD\n- **Budget says \"TBD\" or unclear**: Default to COLD due to lack of budget commitment\n- **Conflicting signals after passing thresholds**: (e.g., high budget, multiple spaces, but vague scope) → WARM with notes for sales team"

Since there's no rush, we can move at your pace.\\n\\nDoes next week work?

Your Houzz ideabook is stunning, and I can absolutely see how we'll transform that cramped, storage-lacking space into an elegant sanctuary.\\n\\nI notice you selected \\\"Full Home Renovation\\\" but specified the primary bedroom, ensuite bath, and walk-in closet. I want to make sure we're aligned on scope - are you planning to renovate additional spaces beyond the primary suite, or is the suite the main focus? Either way, your budget is well-suited, but I'd love to clarify so we can provide the most accurate proposal.\\n\\nSince you prefer to be very involved in selections and decisions (which I love - this is your personal retreat!), our collaborative process will be perfect for you. I'm glad your previous design experience was positive - we'll build on that with clear communication throughout. Your 6-8 month timeline gives us excellent breathing room to source those perfect spa-like finishes and maximize storage solutions.\\n\\nLet's schedule a consultation call this week to walk through your vision in detail, discuss the exact scope, and review our process. I can also share examples of similar primary suite transformations we've completed.\\n\\nWould a video call work for you? I have availability on [Day 1] at [time] or [Day 2] at [time]. We'll spend about 45 minutes getting clear on every detail.\\n\\nExcited to help you create this serene escape!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Email]\\n[Company Website]\"\n}\n```\n\n**Revision Notes:**\n```\n\"Changes needed:\n1. Add a sentence acknowledging that they mentioned their neighbor referred them\n2. Remove the question about scope clarification - we'll address that on the call\n3.

Parse the original JSON\n2. Identify all changes requested\n3. Apply changes systematically\n4. Validate the output\n5. Return clean JSON only\n\n**Example of what you should output:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"subject\": \"The revised subject line based on feedback\",\n  \"email_body\": \"The complete revised email body with all requested changes incorporated.\\n\\nMultiple paragraphs separated by \\\\n\\\\n.\\n\\nAll personalization maintained.\\n\\nClear call to action included.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Email]\\n[Company Website]\"\n}\n```"

Moving away from those dated 90s finishes and creating better lighting and flow will make such a dramatic difference. Reimagining your kitchen, all bathrooms, living areas, and primary suite as a unified, contemporary space is exactly the type of comprehensive project our team specializes in.\\n\\nWith your Q4 2025 timeline, we have an excellent window to execute this thoughtfully.

Either way, your budget is well-suited, but I'd love to clarify so we can provide the most accurate proposal.\\n\\nSince you prefer to be very involved in selections and decisions (which I love - this is your personal retreat!), our collaborative process will be perfect for you.

Our firm typically focuses on larger-scale, full-service design projects, and our minimum project threshold wouldn't be the right fit for a single guest bedroom refresh.

If your design needs evolve to include larger spaces or multiple rooms in the future, we'd be delighted to revisit working together.\\n\\nWishing you the very best with your project!\\n\\nWarm regards,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Title]\\n[Email]\\n[Company Website]\"\n}\n```\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing the email, verify:\n\n- [ ] Client name(s) used correctly and warmly\n- [ ] At least 3 specific details from their form referenced\n- [ ] Their style keywords incorporated naturally\n- [ ] Timeline/urgency addressed appropriately\n- [ ] Involvement preference acknowledged\n- [ ] Any concerns from notes addressed diplomatically\n- [ ] Clear, specific call-to-action with concrete options\n- [ ] Tone matches lead type (urgent for HOT, educational for budget mismatches, respectful for COLD)\n- [ ] **For COLD leads**: Rejection is tactful, includes helpful alternatives, maintains goodwill\n- [ ] Professional but conversational language\n- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors\n- [ ] Word count between 250-400 words\n- [ ] Subject line is compelling and specific\n\n## Important Reminders\n\n1. **Personalization is key** - Generic emails get ignored\n2. **Show, don't tell** - Prove you read their form by referencing specifics\n3. **Be human** - Write like you're talking to a friend of a friend\n4. **Respect their time** - Be concise and clear\n5. **Make it easy** - Remove friction from next step\n6. **Build trust** - Address concerns proactively\n7. **Stay positive** - Even when clarifying budget/scope issues\n8. **Create urgency without pressure** - Based on their timeline, not your sales goals\n9. **For COLD leads**: Rejection should feel respectful and helpful, not dismissive - protect your brand reputation"
