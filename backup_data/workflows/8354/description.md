## Tasks Briefing

This template posts a clean, Slack-ready **morning summary of your Google Tasks due today**. It fetches tasks, filters only those due “today” in your timezone, asks a local **LLM (via LangChain + Ollama)** to produce a short summary (no steps, just a concise brief), strips any hidden `&lt;think&gt;` blocks, and delivers the message to your chosen Slack channel.

## How it works

1. **Trigger at Morning (Cron)** – runs at **7:00 AM** (you can change the hour) to kick things off daily.
2. **Get many tasks (Google Tasks node)** – pulls tasks from your selected Google Tasklist.
3. **Code (Filter Due Today)** – normalizes dates to your timezone, keeps only tasks due today, and emits a fallback flag if none exist.
4. **If** – routes:

   * **True (has tasks)** → continues to the LLM summary path.
   * **False (no tasks)** → sends a “No tasks due today” message to Slack.
5. **Code (Build LLM Prompt)** – builds a compact, Markdown-only prompt for the model (no tool calls).
6. **Basic LLM Chain (LangChain)** + **Ollama Model** – generates a short summary for Slack.
7. **Code (Cleanup)** – removes any `&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;` content if the model includes it.
8. **Send a message (Slack)** – posts the final brief to your Slack channel.

## Required credentials

* **Google Tasks OAuth2 API** – to read tasks from your Google Tasklist.
* **Slack API** – to post the summary into a channel.
* **Ollama** – local model endpoint (e.g., `qwen3:4b`); used by the LangChain LLM nodes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Google Tasks credential**

   * In Google Cloud Console: enable **Google Tasks API**, create an **OAuth Client (Web)**, and set the redirect URI shown by n8n.
   * In n8n **Credentials**, add **Google Tasks OAuth2 API** with scope:

     * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` (read/write) or
     * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks.readonly` (read-only).
   * In the **Get many tasks** node, select your credential and your **Tasklist**.

2. **Slack credential & channel**

   * In n8n **Credentials**, add **Slack API** (bot/user token with `chat:write`).
   * In **Send a message** nodes, select your Slack credential and set the **Channel** (e.g., `#new-leads`).

3. **Ollama model (LangChain)**

   * Ensure **Ollama** is running on your host (default `http://localhost:11434`).
   * Pull a model (e.g., `ollama pull qwen3:4b`) or use another supported model (`llama3:8b`, etc.).
   * In **Ollama Model** node, select your **Ollama** credential and set the **model** name to match what you pulled.

4. **Timezone & schedule**

   * The **Cron** node is set to **7:00 AM**. Adjust as needed.
   * The **Code (Filter Due Today)** node is configured for **Asia/Dhaka**; change the `TZ` constant if you prefer a different timezone.

5. **(Optional) Cleanup safety**

   * The template includes a **Code (Cleanup)** node that strips `&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;` blocks from model output. Keep this connected before the Slack node.

6. **Test the flow**

   * Run the workflow once manually:

     * If you have tasks due today, you should see a concise summary posted to your Slack channel.
     * If none are due, you’ll receive a friendly “No tasks due today” message.

7. **Activate**

   * When everything looks good, toggle the workflow **Active** to receive the daily summary automatically.
