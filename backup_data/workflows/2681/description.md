Automate the curation and sharing of trending GitHub discussions from Hacker News to Twitter and LinkedIn. This workflow leverages AI to generate engaging posts, streamlining your social media content creation and distribution.

**How it Works**

1. **Crawl Hacker News for GitHub Posts**: The workflow fetches trending GitHub-related discussions from Hacker News.
2. **Extract Key Information**: Relevant data such as post titles, URLs, and metadata are extracted and filtered to focus only on unposted content.
3. **Fetch Additional Details**: For each GitHub post, the workflow retrieves extra information from the GitHub repository page to enrich the post content.
4. **Generate Social Media Posts**: Using AI, the workflow automatically generates tailored posts for Twitter and LinkedIn based on the collected data.
5. **Post to Twitter & LinkedIn**: The generated content is posted to your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts.
6. **Track and Log Posts**: Each post is logged in Airtable for tracking, and its status is updated to ensure no duplicate posts are made.
7. **Telegram Notification**: After posting, a summary of the posts is sent to your Telegram chat for real-time updates.
