### How it works

This workflow automates the entire product description process in a few high-level steps:
1.  **Reads Your Products**: The workflow starts by reading product data from your specified Google Sheet, including the product name, an image URL, and optional fields like brand voice or target market.
2.  **Analyzes Product Images**: It downloads each product image and uses an AI vision model (GPT-4o-mini) to perform a detailed visual analysis, extracting objective information like materials, colors, features, and structure.
3.  **Writes Optimized Copy**: The visual analysis and your original data are passed to two specialized AI agents. The first drafts a Shopify-optimized title and description, while the second refines it and generates additional SEO-focused copy for Google Merchant Center.
4.  **Updates Your Spreadsheet**: The final, optimized product titles and descriptions for both Shopify and Google are automatically written back to the original Google Sheet.

### Set up steps

Setting up this workflow takes only a few minutes. You will need to configure credentials for the following services:
* **Google Sheets**: To allow the workflow to read your product list and write back the results.
* **OpenAI**: To power the AI agents that analyze images and generate the copy.

Detailed instructions and customization tips are included in the sticky notes inside the workflow itself.
