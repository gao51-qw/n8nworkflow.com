  "title": "Financial analysis report chatbot agent with Gemini 2.5 Flash and Discord",
  "description": "This n8n template turns chat questions into structured financial reports using Gemini and posts them to a Discord channel via webhook. Ask about tickers, sectors, or theses (e.g., “NVDA long‑term outlook?” or “Gold ETF short‑term drivers?”) and receive a concise, shareable report.\n\nGood to know\n- Not financial advice: Use for insights only; verify independently.\n- Model availability can vary by region. If you see “model not found,” it may be geo‑restricted.\n- Costs depend on model and tokens. Check current Gemini pricing for updates.\n- Discord messages are limited to ~2000 characters per post; long reports may need splitting.\n- Rate limits: Discord webhooks are rate‑limited; add short waits for bursts.\n\nHow it works\n1. Chat Trigger collects the user’s question (public chat supported when the workflow is activated).\n2. Conversation Memory keeps a short window of recent messages to maintain context.\n3. Connect Gemini provides the LLM (e.g., gemini‑2.5‑flash‑lite) and parameters (temperature, tokens).\n4. Agent (agent1) applies a financial analysis System Message to produce structured insights.\n5. Structured Output Parser enforces a simple JSON schema: idea (one‑line thesis) + analysis (Markdown sections).\n6. Code formats a Discord‑ready Markdown report (title, question, executive summary, sections, disclaimer).\n7. Edit Fields maps the formatted report to a clean content field.\n8. Discord Webhook posts the final report to your channel.\n\nHow to use\n- Start with the built‑in Chat Trigger: click Open chat, ask a question, and verify the Discord post.\n- Replace or augment with a Cron or Webhook trigger for scheduled or programmatic runs.\n- For richer context, add HTTP Request nodes (prices, news, filings) and pass summaries to the agent.\n\nRequirements\n- n8n instance with internet access\n- Google AI (Gemini) API key\n- Discord server with a webhook URL\n\nCustomising this workflow\n- System Message: Adjust tone, depth, risk profile, and required sections (Summary, Drivers, Risks, Metrics, Next Steps, Takeaway).\n- Model settings: Switch models or tune temperature/tokens in Connect Gemini.\n- Schema: Extend the parser and formatter with fields like drivers[], risks[], or metrics{}.\n- Formatting: Edit the Code node to change headings, emojis, disclaimers, or add timestamps.\n- Operations: Add retries, message splitting for long outputs, and rate‑limit handling for Discord.\n",
