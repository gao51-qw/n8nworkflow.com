  "description": "This workflow automates the process of creating **short videos from multiple image references** (up to 7 images). It uses \"Vidu Reference to Video\" model, a video generation API to transform a user-provided prompt and image set into a consistent, **AI-generated video**.\n\nThis workflow automates the process of generating AI-powered videos from a set of reference images and then uploading them to **TikTok** and **Youtube**. The process is initiated via a user-friendly web form.\n\n---\n\n### Advantages\n\n* ✅ **Consistent Video Creation**: Uses multiple reference images to maintain subject consistency across frames.\n* ✅ **Easy Input**: Just a simple form with prompt + image URLs.\n* ✅ **Automation**: No manual waiting—workflow checks status until video is ready.\n* ✅ **SEO Optimization**: Automatically generates a catchy, optimized YouTube title using AI.\n* ✅ **Multi-Platform Publishing**: Uploads directly to Google Drive, YouTube, and TikTok in one flow.\n* ✅ **Time Saving**: Removes repetitive tasks of video generation, download, and manual uploading.\n* ✅ **Scalable**: Can run periodically or on-demand, perfect for content creators and marketing teams.\n* ✅ **UGC & Social Media Ready**: Designed for creating **viral short videos** optimized for platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.\n\n---\n### **How It Works**\n\n1.  **Form Trigger:** A user submits a web form with two key pieces of information: a text `Prompt` describing the desired video and a list of `Reference images` (URLs separated by commas or new lines).\n2.  **Data Processing:** The workflow processes the submitted image URLs, converting them from a text string into a proper array format for the AI API.\n3.  **AI Video Generation:** The processed data (prompt and image array) is sent to the **Fal.ai VIDU** API endpoint (`reference-to-video`) to start the video generation job. This node returns a `request_id`.\n4.  **Status Polling:** The workflow enters a loop where it periodically checks the status of the generation job using the `request_id`. It waits for 60 seconds and then checks if the status is `\"COMPLETED\"`. If not, it waits and checks again.\n5.  **Result Retrieval:** Once the video is ready, the workflow fetches the URL of the generated video file.\n6.  **Title Generation:** Simultaneously, the original user prompt is sent to an AI model (GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter) to generate an optimized, engaging title for the social media post.\n7.  **Upload & Distribution:**\n    *   The video file is downloaded from the generated URL.\n    *   A copy is saved to a specified Google Drive folder for storage.\n    *   The video, along with the AI-generated title, is automatically uploaded to **YouTube** and **TikTok** via the **Upload-Post.com** API service.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nThis workflow requires configuration and API keys from three external services to function correctly.\n\n**Step 1: Configure Fal.ai for Video Generation**\n1.  Create an account and obtain your API key.\n2.  In the **\"Create Video\"** HTTP node, edit the \"Header Auth\" credentials.\n3.  Set the following values:\n    *   **Name:** `Authorization`\n    *   **Value:** `Key YOUR_FAL_API_KEY` (replace `YOUR_FAL_API_KEY` with your actual key)\n\n**Step 2: Configure Upload-Post.com for Social Media Uploads**\n1.  Get an API key from your [Upload-Post Manage Api Keys](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=n3witalia&tenantId=upload-post-app) dashboard (10 free uploads per month).\n2.  In both the **\"HTTP Request\"** (YouTube) and **\"Upload on TikTok\"** nodes, edit their \"Header Auth\" credentials.\n3.  Set the following values:\n    *   **Name:** `Authorization`\n    *   **Value:** `Apikey YOUR_UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY` (replace `YOUR_UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY` with your actual key)\n4.  **Crucial:** In the body parameters of both upload nodes, find the `user` field and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the exact name of the social media profile you configured on Upload-Post.com (e.g., `my_youtube_channel`).\n\n**Step 3: Configure Google Drive (Optional Storage)**\nThe **\"Upload Video\"** node is pre-configured to save the video to a Google Drive folder named \"Fal.run\". Ensure your Google Drive credentials in n8n are valid and that you have access to this folder, or change the `folderId` parameter to your desired destination.\n\n**Step 4: Configure AI for Title Generation**\nThe **\"Generate title\"** node uses OpenAI to access the `gpt-5-mini` model..\n\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).",
