  "description": "This workflow allows you to check for preview for a link and return the preview if it exists.\n\n![workflow-screenshot](fileId:411)\n\n**Peekalink node:** This node checks if a preview is available for a URL or not. If a preivew is available the node returns `true`, otherwise `false`.\n\n**IF node:** The IF node checks the output from the previous node. If the condition is `true` the node connected to the ***true*** branch is executed. If the condition is `false` the node connected to the ***false*** branch is executed.\n\n**Peekalink1 node:** This node will fetch the preview of the URL. Based on your use-case, you can connect the **Slack node**, **Mattermost node** etc. to get the response on these platforms.\n\n**NoOp node:** Adding this node here is optional, as the absence of this node won't make a difference to the functioning of the workflow. We've added this as it can sometimes help others with a better understanding of the workflow, visually.",
