This example workflow allows you to create, update, and get a document in Google Cloud Firestore. 

The workflow uses the Set node to set the data, however, you might receive data from a different source. Add the node that receives the data before the Set node and set the values you want to insert in a document, in the Set node. Also, update the ***Columns/ attributes*** fields in the Google Cloud Firestore node.
