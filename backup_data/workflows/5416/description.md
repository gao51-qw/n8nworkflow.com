# AI News Scraping System

This n8n workflow automates the process of pulling in breaking AI-related headlines from curated RSS feeds, scraping their full content, and saving readable Markdown versions directly to Google Drive.

Use cases include:
- Creating a personal newsletter curation system
- Automating blog post research workflows
- Archiving news content for later summarization or AI use

## How it Works

1. **Scheduled Triggers**  
   The workflow runs every 3–4 hours using multiple `Schedule Trigger` nodes. Each trigger targets a different news source (e.g., Google News, OpenAI Blog, Hugging Face, etc.).

2. **Fetch and Parse Feeds**  
   RSS feeds are fetched via the `HTTP Request` node. Items from the feed are split into individual entries using the `Split Out` node.

3. **Scrape Article Content**  
   Each article URL is sent to the Firecrawl API with a prompt to extract only the main content in Markdown. The scraping skips navigation, headers, footers, and ads.

4. **Convert and Save**  
   The extracted Markdown is converted into a `.md` file using the `Convert to File` node. The file is then uploaded to a Google Drive folder.

## Good to Know

- This workflow uses the Firecrawl API for web scraping. Be sure to configure a Generic HTTP Header credential with your API key.
- Output files are saved in Markdown format
- You can add more `Schedule Trigger` + `HTTP Request` pairs to extend this workflow to additional feeds.

## Requirements

- Firecrawl API account for scraping
- Google Drive account (OAuth2 credentials must be configured in n8n)
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)

## Customization Ideas

- Replace or extend RSS feeds with sources relevant to your niche
- Load up scraped news stories into a prompt to create new content like TikToks and Reels
- Add a summarization step using an LLM like GPT or Claude
- Send the Markdown files to Notion, Slack, or a blog CMS
