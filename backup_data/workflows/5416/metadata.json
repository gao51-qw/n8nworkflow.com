  "description": "# AI News Scraping System\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of pulling in breaking AI-related headlines from curated RSS feeds, scraping their full content, and saving readable Markdown versions directly to Google Drive.\n\nUse cases include:\n- Creating a personal newsletter curation system\n- Automating blog post research workflows\n- Archiving news content for later summarization or AI use\n\n---\n\n## How it Works\n\n1. **Scheduled Triggers**  \n   The workflow runs every 3–4 hours using multiple `Schedule Trigger` nodes. Each trigger targets a different news source (e.g., Google News, OpenAI Blog, Hugging Face, etc.).\n\n2. **Fetch and Parse Feeds**  \n   RSS feeds are fetched via the `HTTP Request` node. Items from the feed are split into individual entries using the `Split Out` node.\n\n3. **Scrape Article Content**  \n   Each article URL is sent to the Firecrawl API with a prompt to extract only the main content in Markdown. The scraping skips navigation, headers, footers, and ads.\n\n4. **Convert and Save**  \n   The extracted Markdown is converted into a `.md` file using the `Convert to File` node. The file is then uploaded to a Google Drive folder.\n\n---\n\n## Good to Know\n\n- This workflow uses the Firecrawl API for web scraping. Be sure to configure a Generic HTTP Header credential with your API key.\n- Output files are saved in Markdown format\n- You can add more `Schedule Trigger` + `HTTP Request` pairs to extend this workflow to additional feeds.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Firecrawl API account for scraping\n- Google Drive account (OAuth2 credentials must be configured in n8n)\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n---\n\n## Customization Ideas\n\n- Replace or extend RSS feeds with sources relevant to your niche\n- Load up scraped news stories into a prompt to create new content like TikToks and Reels\n- Add a summarization step using an LLM like GPT or Claude\n- Send the Markdown files to Notion, Slack, or a blog CMS\n\n---\n\n## Example Feeds\n\n| Feed Name        | URL                                                                 |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Google News (AI) | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/AkOariu1C7YyUUMv.json                    |\n| OpenAI Blog      | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/xNVg2hbY14Z7Gpva.json                    |\n| Hugging Face     | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/sgHcE2ehHQMTWhrL.json                    |\n",
