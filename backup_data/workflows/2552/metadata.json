  "description": "**Purpose of workflow:**\nThe purpose of this workflow is to automate  scraping of a website, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it directly into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. \n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Web Scraping: Uses the Jina AI service to scrape website data and convert it into LLM-friendly text.\n2. Information Extraction: Employs an AI node to extract specific book details (title, price, availability, image URL, product URL) from the scraped data.\n3. Data Splitting: Splits the extracted information into individual book entries.\n4. Google Sheets Integration: Automatically populates a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the structured book data.\n\n**Step by step setup:**\n\n1. Set up Jina AI service:\n   - Sign up for a Jina AI account and obtain an API key.\n\n\n2. Configure the HTTP Request node:\n   - Enter the Jina AI URL with the target website.\n   - Add the API key to the request headers for authentication.\n\n3. Set up the Information Extractor node:\n   - Use Claude AI to generate a JSON schema for data extraction.\n   - Upload a screenshot of the target website to Claude AI.\n   - Ask Claude AI to suggest a JSON schema for extracting required information.\n   - Copy the generated schema into the Information Extractor node.\n\n4. Configure the Split node:\n   - Set it up to separate the extracted data into individual book entries.\n\n5. Set up the Google Sheets node:\n   - Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with columns for title, price, availability, image URL, and product URL.\n   - Configure the node to map the extracted data to the appropriate columns.\n",
