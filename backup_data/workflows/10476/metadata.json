  "description": "Monitor and manage Docker containers from Telegram with AI log analysis\n\nThis workflow gives you a smart Telegram command center for your homelab. It lets you monitor Docker containers, get alerts the moment something fails, view logs, and restart services remotely. When you request logs, they're automatically analyzed by an LLM so you get a clear, structured breakdown instead of raw terminal output.\n\n**Who it's for**\n\nAnyone running a self-hosted environment who wants quick visibility and control without SSHing into a server. Perfect for homelab enthusiasts, self-hosters, and DevOps folks who want a lightweight on-call assistant.\n\n**What it does**\n\nReceives container heartbeat alerts via webhook\n\nSends Telegram notifications for status changes or failures\n\nLets you request logs or restart services from chat\n\nAnalyzes logs with GPT and summarizes them clearly\n\nSupports manual “status” and “update all containers” commands\n\n**Requirements**\n\n- Telegram Bot API credentials\n\n- SSH access to your Docker host\n\n**How to set it up**\n\n1. Create a Telegram bot and add its token as credentials\n2. Enter your server SSH credentials in the SSH node\n3. Deploy the workflow and set your webhook endpoint\n4. Tailor container names or heartbeat logic to your environment\n\n**Customize it**\n\nSwap SSH commands for Kubernetes if you're on k8s\n\nChange the AI model to another provider\n\nExtend with health checks or auto-healing logic",
