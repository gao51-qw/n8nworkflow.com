# Scheduled Gmail Cleanup – Auto-Delete Spam, Promotions, Social & Trash to save the Gmail space and time
Managing Gmail manually can be tedious and time-consuming. Spam, Promotions, Social, and Trash folders quickly fill up with unwanted emails, taking up valuable storage and creating clutter. This workflow provides a simple yet powerful **Gmail automation** for efficient **email management**, helping you maintain a cleaner inbox with zero daily effort.  

This workflow is triggered by a **Schedule node** that runs once per day (customizable). It then uses multiple **Gmail nodes** to:  
1. **Fetch Spam Emails** – Identify all emails in the Spam folder.  
2. **Fetch Promotions Emails** – Collect promotional messages from Gmail’s Promotions category.  
3. **Fetch Social Emails** – Pull emails from the Social tab.  
4. **Fetch Trash Emails** – Find all items already marked as trash.  
5. **Delete Fetched Emails** – Automatically delete the emails retrieved from these categories.  

By default, the workflow deletes the selected emails permanently. Once removed, they are not recoverable.
