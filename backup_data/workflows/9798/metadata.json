  "description": "## Automated Invoice Creation & Team Notification with Jotform, Xero, Outlook, and Telegram\nThis workflow automates the entire process of receiving a product/service order, checking or creating a customer in **Xero**, generating an invoice, emailing it, and notifying the sales team for example after sometime if no action has been taken yet (via **Telegram**)  — all triggered by a form submission (via **Jotform**).\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Receive Submission**\n* Triggered when a user submits a form.\n* Collects data like customer details, selected product/service, etc.\n\n2. **Check If Customer Exists**\n* Searches Xero to determine if the customer already exists.\n* ✅ **If Customer Exists:** **Update** customer details.\n* ❌ **If Customer Doesn’t Exist:** **Create** a new customer in Xero.\n\n3. **Create The Invoice**\n* Generates a new invoice for the customer using the item selected.\n\n4. **Send The Invoice**\n* Automatically sends the invoice via email to the customer.\n\n5. **Wait For Sometime**\nNow we will wait for 30 seconds (by default, you can change it) and then get the invoice details from Xero\n\n6. **Notify The Team**\n* Notifies the sales team for example via Telegram in case no action has been taken on the invoice and thus the team can act fast.\n\n## Who Can Benefit from This Workflow?\n* **Freelancers**\n* **Service Providers**\n* **Consultants & Coaches**\n* **Small Businesses**\n* **E-commerce or Custom Product Sellers**\n\n## Requirements\n- Jotform webhook setup, more info [here](https://www.jotform.com/help/245-how-to-setup-a-webhook-with-jotform/)\n- Xero credentials, more info [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/xero)\n- Make sure that products/services values in Jotform are exactly the same as your item `Code` in your Xero account\n- Email setup, update email node (`Send email`), more info about Outlook setup [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftoutlook)\n- LLM model credentials\n- Telegram credentials, more info [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram)",
