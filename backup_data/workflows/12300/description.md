This workflow allows you to automatically expand your B2B target lists by discovering companies similar to your existing leads. 

Instead of manually searching for competitors or lookalikes, you can input a list of domains into Google Sheets and let the CompanyEnrich API generate high-quality lookalike suggestions along with similarity scores.

## Who is this for?
This template is ideal for **GTM Engineers**, **Sales Teams**, and **Growth Hackers** who want to enrich their lead databases and find new prospecting opportunities based on their current ideal customer profile (ICP).

## What it does
1. **Reads Source:** It pulls a list of company domains from a specified Google Sheet.
2. **Enriches:** It sends each domain to the CompanyEnrich API to find similar companies (competitors/lookalikes).
3. **Processes:** It merges the new data with your original list and formats the JSON response.
4. **Saves:** It appends the results (Similar Company Name, Domain, and Similarity Score) back into a new tab in your Google Sheet.

## Requirements
* **Google Sheets:** A spreadsheet with a column named `Domain` containing the websites you want to analyze.
* **CompanyEnrich API Key:** You need an API key from [CompanyEnrich](https://companyenrich.com).
* **n8n Credentials:** Connected Google Sheets account.

## How to set up
1. **Prepare Sheet:** Create a Google Sheet with two tabs. In the first tab, create a column header named `Domain` and add your target websites. Leave the second tab empty for results.
2. **Configure Nodes:** Open the "Read Source List" and "Write Results" nodes to select your spreadsheet file and the respective tabs.
3. **Add API Key:** Open the "Fetch Similar Companies" node. In the **Header Parameters** section, replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual API key (keep the `Bearer ` prefix).

## How to customize
* **Filter by Score:** You can add an "If" node after the API call to filter out results with a low similarity score.
* **Change Destination:** Instead of Google Sheets, you can easily swap the final node to write results to Airtable, Notion, or your CRM (HubSpot/Pipedrive).
