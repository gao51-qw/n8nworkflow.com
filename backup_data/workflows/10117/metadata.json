  "description": "## Event Participant Management and Automated Follow-up System\n\nThis workflow automates the entire process of managing event participants, from registration and payment to sending reminders and follow-up communications. It's designed for event organizers who want to streamline their operations and ensure a smooth experience for attendees.\n\n### Who is this for?\n\nThis template is ideal for event organizers, community managers, and businesses that host workshops, webinars, conferences, or any event requiring participant registration and communication.\n\n### How it works\n\nThe workflow is divided into three main parts:\n\n1.  **Registration and Onboarding:**\n    *   When a new participant registers via a Typeform, their details are immediately added to a Google Sheet.\n    *   Payment is processed via Stripe.\n    *   Upon successful payment, a confirmation email is sent to the participant, and the event is added to their Google Calendar.\n    *   The organizer receives a Slack notification about the new registration.\n\n2.  **Event Reminders:**\n    *   A daily scheduled trigger checks the Google Sheet for upcoming events.\n    *   It calculates if an event is within the specified reminder period (e.g., 3 days before).\n    *   If a reminder is needed, an email is automatically sent to the participant.\n\n3.  **Post-Event Follow-up:**\n    *   Another daily scheduled trigger checks for past events.\n    *   It calculates if an event is due for a follow-up (e.g., 2 days after).\n    *   A thank-you email, including a survey link, is sent to participants.\n    *   The participant's status in the Google Sheet is updated to mark the follow-up as sent.\n\n### How to set it up\n\n1.  **Typeform Registration Form:** Replace `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Typeform Form ID__&gt;` with your actual Typeform ID.\n2.  **Workflow Configuration:** Fill in the placeholder values for `Event Name`, `Event Date`, `Event Time`, `Event Location`, `Participation Fee Amount`, and `Slack Channel ID`.\n3.  **Google Sheets:**\n    *   Replace `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Google Sheets Document ID__&gt;` and `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Sheet Name (e.g., Participants)__&gt;` with your Google Sheet details. Ensure your sheet has columns for \"Name\", \"Email\", \"Phone\", \"Registration Date\", \"Event Name\", \"Event Date\", \"Payment Status\", \"Follow-up Sent\", and \"Follow-up Date\".\n    *   You will need to set up Google Sheets OAuth2 API credentials.\n4.  **Stripe (Process Payment):** Replace `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Customer ID__&gt;` and `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Source ID__&gt;` with your Stripe customer and source IDs. You will need Stripe API credentials.\n5.  **Gmail (Send Confirmation Email, Send Reminder Email, Send Thank You & Survey):** You will need to set up Gmail OAuth2 credentials.\n6.  **Google Calendar (Add to Calendar):** You will need to set up Google Calendar OAuth2 API credentials.\n7.  **Slack (Notify Organizer):** Replace `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Slack Channel ID__&gt;` (if not already set in Workflow Configuration) and set up Slack OAuth2 API credentials.\n8.  **Survey URL (Send Thank You & Survey):** Replace `&lt;__PLACEHOLDER_VALUE__Survey URL__&gt;` with the link to your post-event survey.\n\n### Requirements\n\n*   Typeform account and a registration form.\n*   Google Sheet for participant management.\n*   Stripe account for payment processing.\n*   Gmail account for sending emails.\n*   Google Calendar for event scheduling.\n*   Slack account for organizer notifications.\n*   n8n credentials for Google Sheets, Stripe, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Slack.\n\n### How to customize the workflow\n\n*   **Reminder/Follow-up Timing:** Adjust the `reminderDaysBefore` and `followupDaysAfter` values in the \"Workflow Configuration\" node to change when reminder and follow-up emails are sent.\n*   **Email Content:** Modify the HTML content in the \"Send Confirmation Email\", \"Send Reminder Email\", and \"Send Thank You & Survey\" nodes to match your branding and messaging.\n*   **Payment Currency:** Change the `currency` in the \"Process Payment\" node if your event uses a different currency.\n*   **Additional Data:** Extend the Google Sheets nodes to capture more participant information from Typeform if needed.\n*   **Integration:** Easily integrate with other services by adding more nodes, for example, a CRM to add new participants as leads.\n\n",
