  "description": "## Purpose\n\nThis workflow automatically creates Tasks from forwarded Emails, similar to Asana, but better. Emails are processed by AI and converted to rather actionable task.\n\nIn addition this workflow is build in a way, that multiple users can share this single process by setting up their individual configuration through a user friendly portal (internal tool) instead of the need to manage their own workflows.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7cIvSqJAY0E/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7cIvSqJAY0E)\n\n## How it works\n\n- One Gmail account is used to process inbound mails from different users.\n- A custom web portal enables users to define “routes”. Thats where the mapping between an automatically generated Gmail Alias and a Notion Database URL, including the personal API Token, happens.\n- Using a Gmail Trigger, new entries are split by the Email Alias, so the corresponding route can be retrieved from the Database connected to the portal.\n- Every Email then gets processed by AI to get generate an actionable task and get a short summary of the original Email as well as some metadata.\n- Based on a predefined structure a new Page is created in the corresponding Notion Database.\n- Finally the Email is marked as “processed” in Gmail.\n- If an error happens, the route gets paused for a possible overflow and the user gets notified by Email.\n\n## Setup\n\n- Create a new Google account (alternatively you can use an existing one and set up rules to keep your inbox organized)\n- Create two Labels in Gmail: “Processed” and “Error”\n- Clone [this Softr template including the Airtable dataset](https://studio.softr.io/dashboard?template_id=164f2a23-00c8-4e6b-8bb7-b413b8df6f3a) and publish the application\n- Clone this workflow and choose credentials (Gmail, Airtable)\n- Follow the additional instructions provided within the workflow notes\n- Enable the workflow, so it runs automatically in the background\n\n## How to use\n\n- Open published Softr application\n- Register as a new user\n- Create a new route containing the Notion API key and the Notion Database URL\n- Expand the new entry to copy the Email address\n- Save the address as a new contact in your Email provider of choice\n- Forward an Email to it and watch how it gets converted to an actionable task\n\n## Disclamer\n\n- Airtable was chosen, so you can setup this template fairly quickly. It is advised to replace the persistence by something you own, like a self hosted SQL server, since we are dealing with sensitive information of multiple users\n- This solution is only meant for building internal tools, unless you own an embed license for n8n.",
