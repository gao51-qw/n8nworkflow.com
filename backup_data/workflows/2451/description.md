This workflow downloads all files from a specific folder in a S3 Bucket and compresses them so you can download it via n8n or do further processings.

Fill in your **Credentials and Settings** in the Nodes marked with _"*"_.

Might serve well as Blueprint or as manual Download for S3 Folders. 

Since I found it rather tricky to compress all binary files into one zip file I figured might it be an interesting Template. 

**Hint:**
This is the expression to get every binary key to compress them dynamically. 
```{{ Object.keys($binary).join(',') }}```
(used in the "Compress"-Node)
