  "description": "This simple workflow demonstrates how to get an end user's browser to download a file. It makes use of the [Content-Disposition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition) header to set a filename and control the browser behaviour.\n\n![image.png](fileId:709)\n\nA use case could be the download of a PDF file at the end of an application process or to export data from a database without replacing the current page content in the browser.\n\nWith this approach, the current page remains open and the file is simply downloaded instead:\n\n![image.png](fileId:710)\n\nThe original idea was first present [here](https://community.n8n.io/t/webhook-to-excel-file/11059/24?u=mutedjam) by @dickhoning in the n8n community.",
