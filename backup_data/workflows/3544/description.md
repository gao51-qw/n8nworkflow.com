* Finding relevant keywords that match specific search intents
* Balancing between short-tail and long-tail keywords
* Generating comprehensive keyword lists that cover different aspects of a topic

## What this workflow does
This n8n workflow leverages AI to automatically generate a customized list of 15-20 high-potential keywords based on three simple inputs:
