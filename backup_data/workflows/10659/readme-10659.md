![Analyze & Summarize Amazon Product Reviews with Decodo, OpenAI and Google Sheets](fileId:3311)

This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping, analyzing, and summarizing Amazon product reviews using **Decodo’s Amazon Scraper**, **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini**, and **Google Sheets** for seamless reporting.

It turns messy, unstructured customer feedback into actionable product insights — all without manual review reading.


## Who this is for

This workflow is designed for:

* **E-commerce product managers** who need consolidated insights from hundreds of reviews.
* **Brand analysts and marketing teams** performing sentiment or trend tracking.
* **AI and data engineers** building automated review intelligence pipelines.
* **Sellers and D2C founders** who want to monitor customer satisfaction and pain points.
* **Product researchers** performing market comparison or competitive analysis.


## What problem this workflow solves

Reading and analyzing hundreds or thousands of Amazon reviews manually is inefficient and subjective.

This workflow automates the entire process — from **data collection** to **AI summarization** — enabling teams to instantly identify customer pain points, trends, and strengths.

Specifically, it:

* Eliminates manual review extraction from product pages.
* Generates **comprehensive and abstract summaries** using GPT-4.1-mini.
* Centralizes structured insights into **Google Sheets** for visualization or sharing.
* Helps track product sentiment and emerging issues over time.


## What this workflow does

Here’s a breakdown of the automation process:

1. **Set Input Fields**
   Define your Amazon product URL, geo region, and desired file name.

2. **Decodo Amazon Scraper**
   Fetches real-time product reviews from the Amazon product page, including star ratings and AI-generated summaries.

3. **Extract Reviews Node**
   Extracts raw customer reviews and Decodo’s AI summary into a structured JSON format.

4. **Perform Review Analysis (GPT-4.1-mini)**
   Uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to create two key summaries:

   * **Comprehensive Review:** A detailed summary that captures sentiment, recurring themes, and product pros/cons.
   * **Abstract Review:** A concise executive summary that captures the overall essence of user feedback.

5. **Persist Structured JSON**
   Saves the raw and AI-enriched data to a local file for reference.

6. **Append to Google Sheets**
   Uploads both the original reviews and AI summaries into a Google Sheet for ongoing analysis, reporting, or dashboard integration.

**Outcome:**
You get a structured, AI-enriched dataset of Amazon product reviews — summarized, searchable, and easy to visualize.
