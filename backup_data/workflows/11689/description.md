# AI-Powered Deal Content Recommendation and Personalization (Zoho CRM + OpenAI + Gmail + n8n)

This workflow automates personalized content recommendations for Zoho CRM deals by analyzing deal details, fetching relevant case studies and whitepapers and generating an AI-crafted email tailored to each prospect. It triggers when Zoho CRM sends a Deal ID to the n8n Webhook, processes contextual data, generates recommendations and emails the results automatically.

### 🚀 Quick Start: “5-Step Instant Setup”

1. Import this workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Zoho CRM workflow rule to the Webhook URL and pass the Deal ID.
3. Add Zoho CRM, OpenAI and Gmail credentials in n8n.
4. Update the API URLs for case studies and whitepapers.
5. Activate the workflow and test by updating a deal stage in Zoho CRM.


## What It Does

This workflow enables intelligent content automation by bridging Zoho CRM deal activity with AI-driven contextual recommendations. When a deal advances to a specific stage, Zoho CRM sends its Deal ID to the n8n Webhook. The workflow retrieves the complete deal details — including stage, amount, description, contact and account information — and uses them to determine the prospect’s needs.

It then fetches two content datasets (case studies and whitepapers) from configured API endpoints. The combined dataset is structured and passed to an OpenAI model that analyzes the deal’s industry, pain points and stage to select the most relevant content. The AI generates an email draft featuring these recommendations, which is parsed and automatically delivered via Gmail.

This eliminates manual research, speeds up sales follow-ups and ensures prospects receive focused and valuable resources at the right time.


## Who’s It For

* Sales teams working in Zoho CRM.
* Pre-sales and solution consultants.
* Marketing teams maintaining content libraries.
* CRM admins building smart sales workflows.
* Companies selling B2B products or services with long sales cycles.


## Requirements to Use This Workflow

- An active **n8n** instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- **Zoho CRM OAuth2** credentials
- **OpenAI API key** (for GPT-4o-mini or equivalent model)
- **Gmail OAuth2** credentials
- Two API sources providing:
	- Case studies
	- Whitepapers
- A Zoho CRM workflow rule capable of sending Deal ID to the Webhook


## How It Works & How To Set Up

### 1. Configure the Webhook Trigger

- Copy the Webhook URL from n8n.
- In Zoho CRM → Workflow Rules → Create Rule → choose “Deal Stage Updated.”
- Set Webhook to send the Deal ID to n8n.

### 2. Fetch Deal Details

- The workflow uses the Deal ID received from the Webhook to fetch deal data from Zoho CRM.
- Ensure your Zoho CRM credentials are connected in n8n.

### 3. Prepare Content API Configuration

- Open the “Set Content API Config” node.
- Replace placeholder URLs with your actual API endpoints for case studies and whitepapers.

### 4. Retrieve Content Assets

- The workflow queries your APIs and collects both datasets.
- This ensures updated, relevant assets are always used.

### 5. Structure All Data

- Deal information, case studies and whitepapers are merged into one contextual payload.
- This payload is optimized for the AI model.

### 6. Generate AI Recommendations

- The OpenAI node analyzes the complete dataset.
- It returns recommended case studies, recommended whitepapers and a personalized email draft.

### 7. Parse AI Output

- AI responses are parsed from code-block format into clean JSON for downstream usage.

### 8. Send the Email

- Gmail node sends the personalized email using the AI-generated content.
- Edit the recipient address as needed for production.


## How To Customize Nodes

### Deal Data Extraction

Add or remove fields inside the “Extract Deal Context” node based on your CRM schema.

### Content API Sources

Update URLs or switch to internal CMS, Airtable or Google Sheets.

### AI Prompt Customization

Modify tone, selection logic or output formatting in the OpenAI node prompt.

### Email Delivery

### Filtering Logic

Add rule-based filtering before sending data to AI—for example, industry, region or deal size.
