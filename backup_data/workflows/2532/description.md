# Usage Guide

This workflow backs up all workflows as JSON files named in the `[workflow_name].json` format.

## Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**  
   - Skip this step if using an existing repository.

2. **Add GitHub Credentials**  
   - In **Credentials**, add the GitHub credential for the repository owner.

3. **Download and Import Workflow**  
   - Import this workflow into n8n.

4. **Set Global Values**  
   - In the **Globals** node, set the following:
     - `repo.owner`: GitHub username of the repository owner.
     - `repo.name`: Name of the repository for backups.
     - `repo.path`: Path to the folder within the repository where workflows will be saved.

5. **Configure GitHub Nodes**  
   - Edit each GitHub node in the workflow to use the added credentials.

## Workflow Logic

Each workflow run handles files based on their status:

1. **New Workflow**  
   - If a workflow is new, create a new file in the repository.

2. **Unchanged Workflow**  
   - If the workflow is unchanged, skip to the next item.

3. **Changed Workflow**  
   - If a workflow has changes, update the corresponding file in the repository.

## Current Limitations / Needs work

1. **Name Change of Workflows**  
   - If a workflow is renamed or deleted in n8n, the old file remains in the repository.
2. **Deleted Workflows**  
   - Deleted workflows in n8n are not removed from the repository.
