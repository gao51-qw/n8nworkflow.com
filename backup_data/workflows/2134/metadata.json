  "description": "## How to scrap emails from websites\n\nThis workflow shows how to quickly build an Email scraping API using n8n.\n\nEmail marketing is at the core of most marketing strategies, be it content marketing, sales, etc. As such, being able to find contacts in bulk for your business on a large scale is key. \nThere are available tools available in the market that can do this, but most are premium; why not build a custom one with n8n?\n\n\n## Usage\nThe workflow gets the data from a website and performs an extraction based on the date around on the website\n\n1. Copy the webhook URL to your browser\n2. Add a query parameter eg ?Website=https://mailsafi.com . This should give you a URL like this {{$n8nhostingurl/webhook/ea568868-5770-4b2a-8893-700b344c995e?Website=https://mailsafi.com\n3. Click on the URL and wait for the extracted email to be displayed. \nThis will return the email address on the website, or if there is no email, the response will be \"workflow successfully executed.\"\n\n**Make sure to use HTTP:// for your domains**\n\nOtherwise, you may get an error. \n\n\n\n",
