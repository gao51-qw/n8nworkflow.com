## 🧾 AI Proposal Generator Engine

An n8n-based automation that generates client proposals from a form, lets you review everything in one place, and sends the proposal only when you approve it.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

The AI Proposal Generator Engine creates proposals directly from an **n8n Form**.
All proposal content and a draft email are generated automatically using OpenAI.

**Google Sheets is used only as a database**, where you:

* Review the generated proposal
* Review the draft email
* Control when the proposal is sent by updating the status

No proposal is sent until it is manually marked as `READY`.
