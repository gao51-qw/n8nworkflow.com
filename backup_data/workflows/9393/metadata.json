  "description": "This n8n template automates targeted lead discovery, AI-driven data structuring, and personalized cold-email sending at controlled intervals. It’s ideal for sales teams, founders, and agencies that want to scale outreach without losing personalization.\n\nGood to know\n\nCan run on an interval (e.g., every 10 minutes) to fetch and process new leads.\n\nRequires API keys for OpenAI (content + parsing) and Apify (lead discovery).\n\nEmails are sent one-by-one with delays (the Wait node) to reduce spam risk.\n\nLead data is written to Google Sheets—we recommend separate sheets for leads with and without emails.\n\nWorks with Gmail, Outlook, or your own SMTP—just plug in your credentials.\n\nHow it works\n\nForm Trigger (START)\nA form collects: Job Title, Company Size, Keywords, Location.\n\nApollo URL Generator (GPT)\nThe model turns the form fields into a precise Apollo search URL.\n\nRun Apify (Actor)\nApify fetches contacts/companies that match your preferences for downstream processing.\n\nLimit\nCaps how many records are prepared per run (e.g., max 5).\n\nParse Lead Data (GPT)\n\nExtracts key fields (full name, email, title, LinkedIn, company, company links).\n\nSynthesizes a short 2–3 sentence sales-ready summary for each lead.\n\nSorting (If)\nSplits leads into with email vs. without email.\n\nWith email → main sheet + email pathway\n\nWithout email → a separate sheet for later enrichment\n\nEmail Magic (GPT)\nUses the parsed data to personalize your fixed email template for each lead (keeps structure/intent, swaps in the right details).\n\nSending Emails (Loop + Wait + Sender)\n\nLoop Over sends messages individually.\n\nWait inserts a pause between sends (fully configurable).\n\nDelivery via Gmail or SMTP (custom domain / Outlook).\n\nConfirmation\nAfter the loop finishes, a Gmail node sends a “campaign complete” confirmation.\n\nHow to use\n\nEnable the workflow and open the start form.\n\nEnter preferences: job title, company size, keywords, location.\n\nAdd credentials:\n\nOpenAI (for parsing + email generation)\n\nApify (Bearer token in Run Apify)\n\nGoogle (Sheets + optionally Gmail)\n\nSMTP/Outlook (if not using Gmail)\n\nSet limits (the Limit node) and send interval (the Wait node).\n\nChoose sheets for leads with/without email.\n\nRun—the workflow will fetch leads, prepare emails, and send them with spacing.\n\nRequirements\n\nOpenAI API key\n\nApify API token (access to the chosen Actor)\n\nGoogle Sheets for storage\n\nGmail or SMTP/Outlook credentials for sending\n\nAn operational n8n instance\n\nCustomising this workflow\n\nEmail template: Edit the text in “Creating a email” while preserving placeholders.\n\nSegmentation: Add more conditions (role, industry, country) and route to different templates/sheets.\n\nFollow-ups: Add a second loop that reads statuses and sends timed reminders.\n\nData enrichment: Insert additional APIs before “Parse Lead Data.”\n\nAnti-spam: Increase Wait duration, rotate senders, vary subject lines.\n\nReporting: Add a “send status” sheet and an error log.\n\nSecurity & compliance tips\n\nStore API keys in n8n Credentials, not plain-text nodes.\n\nRespect GDPR/opt-out—track source and first-contact date in your sheet.\n\nStart with a small batch, validate deliverability, then scale up.\n\nIn short\n\nAutomated lead capture → AI cleaning + summary → personalized emails → spaced sending → completion notice.\nScalable, customizable, and ready to plug into your preferred sender and template.",
