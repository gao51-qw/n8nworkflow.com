This workflow automates the `Mark as Fulfilled` action in Shopify for each order, ensuring a seamless fulfillment process without manual intervention.

## How It Works
This workflow retrieves all unfulfilled orders and processes their fulfillment automatically. Since Shopify requires a [Fulfillment Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/fulfillmentorder#get-orders-order-id-fulfillment-orders) (not [Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/order#get-orders-order-id?fields=id,line-items,name,total-price)) to trigger fulfillment, the workflow follows these steps:

1️⃣ Get all unfulfilled orders using the Shopify node.
2️⃣ Retrieve the Fulfillment Order ID using the "List Fulfillment Orders" action.
3️⃣ Create a fulfillment request using "Mark fulfillment order as fulfilled."
4️⃣ Handle edge cases, such as partially fulfilled orders or API errors.

This ensures that every valid order is marked as fulfilled efficiently.

## Step-by-step
The workflow can be run as requested or on schedule

You can adjust these parameters within the Shopify and filter nodes:

**Shopify Admin URL** – A Global node to customize the Shopify store URL.
 - To find your Shopify store ID, login into your Shopify admin, then look at the URL in your browser's address bar, the subdomain portion (e.g., `example_store_id.myshopify.com`) is your store ID (in this case: `example_store_id`)

**Order Filtering** – Ensures only valid orders are fulfilled, particularly useful if:

- You sell digital downloads or gift cards exclusively.
- You use third-party fulfillment services for all products.

## Credentials
To run this workflow, you'll need:

- Shopify API Key – Required for authentication.

## Who Is This For?
Shopify store owners looking to automate their fulfillment process.

Merchants selling digital or personalized products who need instant fulfillment.
