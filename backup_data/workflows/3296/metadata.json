  "description": "This workflow automates the `Mark as Fulfilled` action in Shopify for each order, ensuring a seamless fulfillment process without manual intervention.\n\n![image.png](fileId:1030)\n\n## How It Works\nThis workflow retrieves all unfulfilled orders and processes their fulfillment automatically. Since Shopify requires a [Fulfillment Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/fulfillmentorder#get-orders-order-id-fulfillment-orders) (not [Order ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2025-01/resources/order#get-orders-order-id?fields=id,line-items,name,total-price)) to trigger fulfillment, the workflow follows these steps:\n\n1️⃣ Get all unfulfilled orders using the Shopify node.\n2️⃣ Retrieve the Fulfillment Order ID using the \"List Fulfillment Orders\" action.\n3️⃣ Create a fulfillment request using \"Mark fulfillment order as fulfilled.\"\n4️⃣ Handle edge cases, such as partially fulfilled orders or API errors.\n\nThis ensures that every valid order is marked as fulfilled efficiently.\n🔗 Ongoing discussions on this topic: [Relevant Shopify API Discussion](https://community.shopify.com/c/shopify-flow-app/how-can-i-use-flow-to-automatically-fulfil-one-product/m-p/2209832)\n\n## Step-by-step\nThe workflow can be run as requested or on schedule\n\nYou can adjust these parameters within the Shopify and filter nodes:\n\n**Shopify Admin URL** – A Global node to customize the Shopify store URL.\n - To find your Shopify store ID, login into your Shopify admin, then look at the URL in your browser's address bar, the subdomain portion (e.g., `example_store_id.myshopify.com`) is your store ID (in this case: `example_store_id`)\n\n**Order Filtering** – Ensures only valid orders are fulfilled, particularly useful if:\n\n- You sell digital downloads or gift cards exclusively.\n- You use third-party fulfillment services for all products.\n\n## Credentials\nTo run this workflow, you'll need:\n\n- Shopify API Key – Required for authentication.\n\n## Who Is This For?\nShopify store owners looking to automate their fulfillment process.\n\nMerchants selling digital or personalized products who need instant fulfillment.\n\n---\nExplore More Templates  \n👉 [Check out my other n8n templates](https://n8n.io/creators/bangank36/)\n",
