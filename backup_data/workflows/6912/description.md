# CDO Agent with Data Analytics Team

## Description
Complete AI-powered data analytics department with a Chief Data Officer (CDO) agent orchestrating specialized data team members for comprehensive data science, business intelligence, and analytics operations.

## Overview
This n8n workflow creates a comprehensive data analytics department using AI agents. The CDO agent analyzes data requests and delegates tasks to specialized agents for data science, business intelligence, data engineering, machine learning, data visualization, and data governance.

## Features
- Strategic CDO agent using OpenAI O3 for complex data strategy and decision-making
- Six specialized data analytics agents powered by GPT-4.1-mini for efficient execution
- Complete data analytics lifecycle coverage from collection to insights
- Automated data pipeline management and ETL processes
- Advanced machine learning model development and deployment
- Interactive data visualization and business intelligence reporting
- Comprehensive data governance and compliance frameworks

## Team Structure
- **CDO Agent**: Data strategy leadership and team delegation (O3 model)
- **Data Scientist Agent**: Statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms
- **Business Intelligence Analyst Agent**: Business metrics, KPI tracking, performance dashboards
- **Data Engineer Agent**: Data pipelines, ETL processes, data warehousing, infrastructure
- **Machine Learning Engineer Agent**: ML model deployment, MLOps, model monitoring
- **Data Visualization Specialist Agent**: Interactive dashboards, data storytelling, visual analytics
- **Data Governance Specialist Agent**: Data quality, compliance, privacy, governance policies

## How to Use
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance
2. Configure OpenAI API credentials for all chat models
3. Deploy the webhook for chat interactions
4. Send data analytics requests via chat (e.g., "Analyze customer churn patterns and create predictive models")
5. The CDO will analyze and delegate to appropriate specialists
6. Receive comprehensive data insights and deliverables

## Use Cases
- **Predictive Analytics**: Customer behavior analysis, sales forecasting, risk assessment
- **Business Intelligence**: KPI tracking, performance analysis, strategic business insights
- **Data Engineering**: Pipeline automation, data warehousing, real-time data processing
- **Machine Learning**: Model development, deployment, monitoring, and optimization
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards, executive reporting, data storytelling
- **Data Governance**: Quality assurance, compliance frameworks, data privacy protection

## Requirements
- n8n instance with LangChain nodes
- OpenAI API access (O3 for CDO, GPT-4.1-mini for specialists)
- Webhook capability for chat interactions
- Optional: Integration with data platforms and analytics tools

## Cost Optimization
- O3 model used only for strategic CDO decisions and complex data strategy
- GPT-4.1-mini provides 90% cost reduction for specialist data tasks
- Parallel processing enables simultaneous agent execution
- Template libraries reduce redundant analytics development work

## Integration Options
- Connect to data platforms (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks)
- Integrate with BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Grafana)
- Link to ML platforms (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, Google AI Platform)
- Export to business applications and reporting systems
