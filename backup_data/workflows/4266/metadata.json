  "description": "## 🔄 Reddit Content Operations via MCP Server\n\n### 🧑‍💼 Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is built for content creators, marketers, Reddit automation enthusiasts, and AI agent developers who want structured, programmable access to Reddit content. If you're researching niche communities, tracking trends, or automating Reddit engagement — this is for you.\n\n### 💡 What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nReddit has valuable content scattered across subreddits, but manual analysis or engagement is inefficient. This workflow acts as a centralized API interface to:\n\n- Query and manage Reddit posts\n- Create, fetch, delete, and reply to comments\n- Analyze subreddit metadata and behavior\n- Enable AI agents to autonomously operate on Reddit data\n\nIt does this using an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** over **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.\n\n### ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\nThis template sets up a custom **MCP Server** that listens for JSON-based operation commands sent via SSE. Based on the operation, it routes the request to one of the following branches:\n\n#### 🟥 Post CRUD\n\n- Create a new Reddit post\n- Search posts across subreddits\n- Fetch posts by ID\n- Delete existing posts\n\n#### 🟩 Comment CRUD\n\n- Create or reply to comments\n- Fetch multiple comments from posts\n- Delete specific comments\n\n#### 🟦 Subreddit Read Operations\n\n- Get information about subreddits\n- List subreddit posts\n- Retrieve subreddit rules\n\n### 🛠 Setup\n\n1. Import this workflow into your **self-hosted n8n instance**.\n2. Configure Reddit credentials (OAuth2).\n3. Connect your input system to the MCP Server Trigger node via SSE.\n4. Send operation payloads to the server like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"operation\": \"post_search\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"query\": \"AI agents\",\n    \"subreddit\": \"machinelearning\"\n  }\n}\nThe workflow will route to the appropriate node based on operation type.\n\n🧩 Supported Operations\npost_create\n\npost_get_many\n\npost_search\n\npost_delete\n\npost_get_by_id\n\ncomment_create\n\ncomment_reply\n\ncomment_get_many\n\ncomment_delete\n\nsubreddit_get_about\n\nsubreddit_get_many\n\nsubreddit_get_rules\n```\n\n### 🧠 How to customize this workflow to your needs\nAdd new operations to the operation_switch node for additional API functionality.\n\nChain results into Notion, Slack, Airtable, or external APIs.\n\nIntegrate with OpenAI/GPT to summarize posts or filter content.\n\nAdd logic to score and sort content by engagement, sentiment, or keywords.\n\n### 🟨 Sticky Notes\nEach operation group is color-coded (Posts, Comments, Subreddits).\n\nSticky Notes explain the purpose and dependencies of each section.\n\nEasy to maintain and extend with clear logical separation.\n\n### ⚠️ This template uses a custom MCP Server node and only works in self-hosted n8n.\n\n### 🖼 Workflow Preview\n\n![Screenshot 20250520 at 11.57.41 PM.png](fileId:1346)",
