All discovered URLs are added directly to your Google Sheet.\n\n**How to set up:**  \n1. Create an Extruct account at [www.extruct.ai/](https://www.extruct.ai/).  \n2. Open the Extruct table template, find the table ID in your browser’s address bar, and copy it.  \n3. Make a copy of the provided Google Sheets template to your own Google Drive.  \n4. In n8n, paste the table ID into the variables node of your flow.  \n5. Set up Bearer authentication in every HTTP Request node using your Extruct API token (found on the API page in Extruct).  \n6. In the Google Sheets node, paste the link to your copied template and connect your Google account.  \n7. Run the flow once to load the fields, then map the output fields to the correct columns in your sheet.  \n8. Activate the flow and start adding companies via the form.\n\n**Requirements:**  \n- Extruct account and API token  \n- Extruct table template  \n- Google account with Google Sheets\n\n**How to customize the workflow:**  \nYou can add your own columns to the Extruct table and your Google Sheet.
