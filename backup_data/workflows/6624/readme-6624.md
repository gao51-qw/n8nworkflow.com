## Who's it for

This template is perfect for:
* Business teams who maintain their knowledge base in Excel spreadsheets
* Organizations with existing data and processes in Microsoft 365

## How it works

The workflow combines OpenAI's language model with Microsoft Excel's spreadsheet capabilities to create a smart chatbot. When users ask questions, the AI agent automatically determines which Excel worksheets and data ranges are relevant and uses that information to generate helpful responses. The system maintains conversation history for natural, contextual interactions.

## How to set up

1. **Add your credentials:**
   - Configure your **Microsoft Excel** (Office 365) credentials in the Get Excel Data node
   - Set up your **OpenAI API** credentials in the OpenAI Chat Model node

2. **Configure your Excel connection:**
   - Click the **Get Excel Data** node
   - Select your Excel workbook containing your knowledge base data
   - The AI will automatically determine relevant worksheets and data ranges

3. **Customize the AI model:**
   - Open the **OpenAI Chat Model** node
   - Choose your preferred model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)
   - Adjust token limits if needed

4. **Test the chatbot:**
   - Click the **Chat** button to start a conversation
   - Ask questions related to your Excel data

5. **Optional - Make it public:**
   - Enable public access in the Chat Trigger node
   - Embed the provided code into your website

**Update System Instructions:**
Edit the Smart AI Agent's system message to change how the assistant behaves or add specific instructions for your use case.

**Connect Multiple Workbooks:**
Add additional Get Excel Data nodes to give the AI access to multiple Excel workbooks within your Microsoft 365 environment.

**Add Data Validation:**
Include nodes to validate Excel data format and structure before processing to ensure consistent AI responses.

**Add More Tools:**
Extend the AI agent with additional tools like web search, email sending, or integration with other Microsoft 365 services.
