  "description": "Extract Title tag and meta description from url for SEO analysis.\n\n## How it works\nThe workflows takes records from Airtable, get the url in the records and extract from the related webpage the title tag (&lt;title&gt;) and meta description (&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Some content\"&gt;). \n\nIf title tag and/or meta description tag isn't available on the webpage, the result will be empty.\n\n## Setup\n1. Set a Base in Airtable with a table with the following structure:\n  `url` (field type url), `title tag` (field type text string), `meta desc` (field type text field)\n\nMinimum suggested table structure is:\n\n**url** (https://example.com), **title** (Title example), *meta desc** (This is the meta description of the example page)\n\n2. Connect Airtable to both Airtable nodes in the template and, with the following formula, get all the records that miss `title tag` and `meta desc`.\nFormula: \n```\nAND(url != \"\", {title tag} = \"\", {meta desc} = \"\")\n```\n\n3. Insert the url to be analyzed in the table in the field `url` and let the workflow do the rest. \n\n\n## Extra\n\n* You can also calculate the length for title tag and meta desc using formula field inside Airtable. This is the formula:\n  `LEN({title tag})` or `LEN({meta desc})`\n* You can automate the process calling a Webhook from Airtable. For this, you need an Airtable paid plan.\n",
