## How it works

This workflow identifies HubSpot deals that have gone untouched for 21+ days and automatically updates their status to Closed Lost. It fetches associated contacts, retrieves their details, and sends personalized follow-up emails requesting feedback. Finally, it notifies your team via Slack about the deals moved to Closed Lost. The workflow runs on a scheduled interval, ensuring consistent lead management without manual intervention.

## Step-by-step

**1. Trigger the workflow**  
- **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow at a defined interval (daily, weekly, etc.).  
- **Get HubSpot Deals** – Retrieves all deals with key properties from HubSpot.  
- **Extract Deal Fields** – Normalizes deal data for consistent processing.  

**2. Identify and update cold deals**  
- **Filter Cold Leads (21+ days)** – Keeps only deals not updated in the past 21 days.  
- **Update Deal to Closed Lost** – Marks stale deals as Closed Lost in HubSpot.  

**3. Map deals to contacts**  
- **Fetch Deal Associations** – Retrieves contacts linked to filtered deals.  
- **Extract Contact IDs** – Parses associations to get contactId, dealId, and dealName.  
- **Get Contact Details** – Fetches enriched contact information.  
- **Extract Contact Email** – Simplifies data, keeping only the email field.  

**4. Follow-up & team notification**  
- **Send Gmail Feedback Request** – Sends a personalized thank-you email requesting feedback.  
- **Send Slack Notification** – Alerts the team about deals updated to Closed Lost.
