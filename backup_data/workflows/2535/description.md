**Facebook access tokens expire quickly, requiring regular updates for continued API access.** This workflow simplifies the process of exchanging short-lived tokens for long-lived ones, saving time and reducing manual effort.

**What this workflow does**
- Exchanges a short-lived Facebook User Access Token for a long-lived token using the Facebook Graph API.
- Optionally retrieves a long-lived Page Access Token associated with the user.
- Outputs both the user and page tokens for further use in automation or integrations.

**Setup**
**Prerequisites:**

- A valid Facebook App ID and App Secret.
- A short-lived User Access Token from the Facebook platform.
- (Optional) The App-Scoped User ID for fetching associated page tokens.

**Workflow Configuration:**
- Replace placeholder values in the "Set Parameter" node with your Facebook credentials and token.
- Run the workflow manually to generate long-lived tokens.
