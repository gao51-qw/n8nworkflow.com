## Verified Parent Consent Form Automation for School Trips

---

## 🎯 **Description**

This workflow automates the **entire parent consent process for school field trips**, replacing manual paper forms with a secure, verified, and legally compliant digital system.

When a parent submits consent data via **POST request (from Postman or any form)**, the workflow:

1. **Receives parent & trip details** through a Webhook trigger.
2. **Verifies the parent’s email** using the **VerifiEmail API** to prevent fake or disposable entries.
3. **Generates a unique Consent ID** and timestamps for tracking and legal validation.
4. **Creates a professional HTML-based digital consent form**, including child details, trip information, and a parent signature section.
5. **Converts the HTML document to a PDF** using the **HTMLCSSToPDF API** (ready for printing or archiving).
6. **Uploads the PDF to Google Drive** automatically, organizing it under a designated folder (e.g., `/School_Consents/2025/November`).
7. **Sends an automated Gmail notification** to the respective class teacher, including all verified details and the Drive reference.
8. **Responds instantly** to the original POST request with a success confirmation and all metadata (Consent ID, verification status, storage location, timestamp).
9. **Handles invalid emails gracefully**, returning a 400 error response for unauthorized or unverified submissions.
10. **Provides complete traceability**, digital audit, and tamper-proof documentation for school compliance.

**Use Case:**
Ideal for schools, institutions, or organizations that need **paperless consent workflows** with **email verification**, **cloud storage**, and **automated staff alerts** — ensuring authenticity, security, and compliance.
