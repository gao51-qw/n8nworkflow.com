# Automated SEO indexing: sitemap to GSC & indexing API

> This workflow helps SEO professionals and website owners automate the tedious process of monitoring and indexing URLs. It fetches your XML sitemap, filters for recent content, checks the current indexing status via Google Search Console (GSC), and automatically submits non-indexed URLs to the Google Indexing API.

By integrating a local submission state (Static Data), it ensures that your API quota is used efficiently by preventing redundant submissions within a 7-day window.

## Key Features

**Smart Sitemap Support**: Handles both standard sitemaps and Sitemap Indexes (nested sitemaps).

**Status Check**: Uses GSC URL Inspection to verify if a page is truly missing from Google's index before taking action.

**Quota Optimization**: Filters content by lastmod date and tracks submission history to stay within Google's API limits.

**Rate Limiting**: Includes built-in batching and delays to comply with Google's API throughput requirements.

## Prerequisites

**Google Search Console API**: Enabled in your Google Cloud Console.

**Google Indexing API**: Enabled for instant indexing.

**Service Account**: You need a Service Account JSON key with "Owner" permissions in your GSC Property.
