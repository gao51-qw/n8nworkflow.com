Your design is polished.\n\nBut…\n\n❌ Your page isn’t ranking where it should.\n❌ Your competitors are outranking you—even with weaker content.\n❌ You have no idea what’s wrong—or how to fix it.\n\nThe truth? SEO isn’t just about keywords.\n\nYour technical setup, content structure, and on-page elements must work together seamlessly.\nAnd if anything is off? Google won’t rank your page.\n\n## Who Is This For?\n- SaaS Founders & Startups – Get higher rankings & organic traffic that converts.\n- Marketing Teams & Agencies – Audit & optimize pages in seconds.\n- E-commerce & Content Sites – Improve rankings for product pages, blogs, and landing pages.\n\n## How It Works\n1.
