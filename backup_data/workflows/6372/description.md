💬🗂️🤖 This workflow automates the **translation of Google Slides presentations** from **any languages**, while preserving the original formatting and slide structure. It leverages **Google APIs**, **AI translation (Gemini/PaLM)**, and modular execution for high flexibility and accuracy.

**DISCLAIMER**: texts are split by Google Slides APIs into small blocks, so the translation will not always be contextualized.

###  **Key Benefits**

* **⚡ Time-Saving**: Automates a typically manual and error-prone task of translating slides.
* **🌍 AI-Powered Accuracy**: Uses Google Gemini to provide context-aware translations while respecting defined rules.
* **🔒 Safe & Non-Destructive**: The original presentation is never modified — a new copy is always created.
* **🎯 Precision**: Skips irrelevant text (e.g., emails, URLs, names) to avoid mistranslation.
* **🔁 Modular & Scalable**: Uses subworkflows and batching, ideal for presentations with many slides.
* **🎨 Layout Preservation**: Keeps the original design and formatting intact.

### **How it Works**  
1. **Initialization**:  
   - The workflow starts with a manual trigger ("When clicking ‘Execute workflow’"). 
   - Set the language to translate (IMPORTANT **format ISO-639**) 
   - It duplicates a specified Google Slides presentation ("Duplicate presentation") to create a new copy for translation, preserving the original.  

2. **Slide Processing**:  
   - The workflow retrieves slides from the copied presentation ("Get slides from a presentation") and processes them in batches ("Loop Over Items").  
   - For each slide, text content is extracted ("Extract Text") using a custom JavaScript snippet, which identifies and collects text elements while retaining the slide's `objectId`.  

3. **Translation**:  
   - The extracted texts are passed to a LangChain agent ("Translation expert"), which translates the content from Italian to English. The agent follows strict guidelines (e.g., skipping URLs, brand names, etc.).  
   - The translated text is sent to the "Translate Google Slides" node, which replaces the original text in the presentation using the slide's `objectId` for targeting.  

4. **Execution Flow**:  
   - The workflow includes delays ("Wait 10 sec" and "Wait 3 sec") to manage API rate limits and ensure smooth execution.  
   - The process repeats for each batch of slides until all content is translated.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Ensure access to the source Google Slides presentation (specified by `fileId` in "Duplicate presentation").  
   - Set up Google OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive and Slides (nodes reference credentials like "Google Slides account").  
   - Configure the Google Gemini (PaLM) API credentials for the translation agent.  

2. **Configuration**:  
   - Update the `fileId` in the "Duplicate presentation" node to point to your source presentation.  
   - Adjust the translation guidelines in the "Translation expert" node if needed (e.g., language pairs or exclusion rules).  
   - Modify batch sizes or wait times (e.g., "Wait 10 sec") based on API constraints.  

3. **Execution**:  
   - Run the workflow manually or trigger it via the "Execute Workflow" node from another workflow.  
   - Monitor progress in n8n’s execution log, as each slide is processed and translated sequentially.  

4. **Output**:  
   - The translated presentation is saved as a new file in Google Drive, with the filename including a timestamp (e.g., `NAME_PRESENTATION_{lang}_{timestamp}`).  

*Note*: The workflow is currently inactive (`"active": false`); enable it after configuration.
