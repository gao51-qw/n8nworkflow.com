## How it Works

This workflow automatically monitors your Google Ads campaigns every day, analyzing performance with AI-powered scoring to identify scaling opportunities and catch issues before they drain your budget. Each morning at 9 AM, it fetches all active campaign data including clicks, impressions, conversions, costs, and conversion rates from your Google Ads account.

The AI analysis engine evaluates four critical dimensions: CTR (click-through rate) to measure ad relevance, conversion rate to assess landing page effectiveness, cost per conversion to evaluate profitability, and traffic volume to identify scale-readiness. Each campaign receives a performance score (0-100 points) and is automatically categorized as Excellent (75+), Good (55-74), Fair (35-54), or Underperforming (0-34).

High-performing campaigns trigger instant Slack alerts to your PPC team with detailed scaling recommendations and projected ROI improvements, while underperforming campaigns generate urgent alerts with specific optimization actions. Every campaign is logged to your Google Sheets dashboard with daily metrics, and the system generates personalized email reports—action-oriented scaling plans for top performers and troubleshooting guides for campaigns needing attention.

The entire analysis takes minutes, providing your team with daily intelligence reports that would otherwise require hours of manual spreadsheet work and data analysis.

## Customization Guidance

- **Scoring Weights:** Adjust point values for CTR (30), conversion rate (35), cost efficiency (25), and volume (10) in the AI Performance Analysis node based on your business priorities.
- **Performance Thresholds:** Modify the 75-point Excellent threshold and 55-point Good threshold to match your campaign quality distribution and industry benchmarks.
- **Benchmark Values:** Update CTR benchmarks (5% excellent, 3% good, 1.5% average) and conversion rate targets (10%, 5%, 2%) for your industry.
- **Alert Channels:** Create separate Slack channels for different alert types or route critical alerts to Microsoft Teams, Discord, or SMS via Twilio.
- **Email Recipients:** Configure different recipient lists for scaling alerts (executives, growth team) vs. optimization alerts (campaign managers).
- **Schedule Frequency:** Change from daily to hourly monitoring for high-spend campaigns, or weekly for smaller accounts.
- **Additional Platforms:** Duplicate the workflow structure for Facebook Ads, Microsoft Ads, or LinkedIn Ads with platform-specific nodes.
- **Budget Controls:** Add nodes to automatically pause campaigns exceeding cost thresholds or adjust bids based on performance scores.
