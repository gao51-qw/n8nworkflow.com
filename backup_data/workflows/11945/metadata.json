  "description": "# Real-Time WooCommerce Return Surge Detection with Slack Alerts & Airtable Logging\n\n\nThis n8n workflow monitors WooCommerce refund activity to detect unusual spikes in product returns at the SKU level. It compares return volumes across rolling 24-hour windows, alerts teams in Slack when defined thresholds are exceeded and logs all detected events into Airtable for tracking and analysis.\n\n### 🚀 Quick Start – Get This Running Fast\n\n1. Import the workflow into n8n.\n2. Connect your WooCommerce API credentials.\n3. Configure Slack and Airtable credentials.\n4. Set your preferred schedule interval.\n5. Activate the workflow and start monitoring returns automatically.\n\n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow is designed to automatically detect abnormal return behavior in a WooCommerce store. On every scheduled run, it fetches recent orders and refunds directly from the WooCommerce REST API. Refund records are mapped back to their original orders to accurately identify affected SKUs.\n\nUsing a rolling time-window comparison, the workflow calculates current versus previous return counts per SKU. It identifies significant increases—either large percentage spikes or unusually high absolute return volumes. This ensures early detection of potential product quality, packaging or fulfillment issues.\n\nWhen a return surge is detected, the workflow sends a structured alert to a Slack channel and stores the alert data in Airtable. This creates a searchable, historical log that supports investigations, trend analysis and operational decision-making.\n\n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n- eCommerce operations teams.\n- Quality assurance and product managers.\n- Customer support leads.\n- Supply chain and fulfillment teams.\n- Store owners running WooCommerce at scale.\n\n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\nTo use this workflow, you will need:\n\n- An active **WooCommerce** store with REST API access.\n- **WooCommerce API credentials** (Consumer Key & Secret).\n- An active **Slack workspace** with permission to post messages.\n- An **Airtable base and table** for logging alerts.\n- An **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud).\n\n\n## How It Works & How To Set Up\n\n### Workflow Execution Flow\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs the workflow at a fixed interval.\n2. **Time Window** node defines current and previous 24-hour comparison windows.\n3. **HTTP Orders** fetches recent WooCommerce orders.\n4. **HTTP Refunds** fetches refund records.\n5. **Orders_Fetch (Code)** maps refunds to parent orders and extracts SKU-level data.\n6. **Refund_details (Code)** aggregates returns, compares windows, and calculates increases.\n7. **IF Node** checks surge conditions:\n   - ≥100% increase OR\n   - ≥25 current returns\n8. **Set Fields** enriches data with status, run date, and cooldown key.\n9. **Slack Node** sends a formatted alert message.\n10. **Code Node** normalizes Slack output into structured fields.\n11. **Airtable Node** stores alert records for future reference.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n- Replace `{your_woocommerce_domain}` with your actual store domain.\n- Verify WooCommerce API permissions allow order and refund access.\n- Select the correct Slack channel in the Slack node.\n- Ensure Airtable column names match the workflow mappings.\n\n\n## How To Customize Nodes\n\nYou can easily adapt this workflow by:\n\n- Changing the **schedule frequency** in the Schedule Trigger.\n- Adjusting **WINDOW_HOURS** in the Code nodes.\n- Modifying **alert thresholds** in the IF node.\n- Customizing the **Slack message format**.\n- Adding or removing **Airtable fields** for reporting needs.\n\n\n## Add-ons (Optional Enhancements)\n\nThis workflow can be extended with:\n\n- Email or Microsoft Teams notifications.\n- Jira or Linear ticket creation.\n- Product auto-pause for extreme return spikes.\n- Dashboard reporting using BI tools.\n- Cooldown logic to prevent repeated alerts per SKU.\n\n\n## Use Case Examples\n\nCommon use cases include:\n- Detecting defective product batches early.\n- Identifying packaging or shipping damage trends.\n- Monitoring supplier quality issues.\n- Supporting refund root-cause analysis.\n- Improving customer satisfaction metrics.\n\nThere can be many more operational and analytical use cases based on your business needs.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| No Slack alerts | Threshold not met | Lower IF condition limits |\n| Empty SKU values | Missing SKU in WooCommerce | Use product name or ID fallback |\n| No data in Airtable | Column mismatch | Verify field names and types |\n| API errors | Invalid credentials | Re-authorize WooCommerce API |\n| Duplicate alerts | Frequent schedule | Add cooldown or deduplication logic |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nNeed assistance setting this up or customizing it for your business?
