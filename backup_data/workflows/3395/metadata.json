  "description": "### This n8n template builds a simple automation to ensure no JIRA issues go unassigned for more than a week to prevent them falling through the cracks. It uses AI to perform searching tasks against a Supabase Vector Store.\nThis can be one way to help reduce the amount of manual work in managing the issue backlog for busy teams with little effort.\n\n### How it works\n* This template contains 2 separate flows which run continuously via schedule triggers.\n* The first populates our Supabase vector store with resolved issues within the last day. This helps keep our vector store up-to-date and relevant for the purpose of finding similar issues.\n* It does this by pulling the latest resolved issues from JIRA and populating the Supabase vectorstore with carefully chosen metadata. This will come in handy later.\n* The second flow watches for stale, unassigned issues for the purpose of aut-assigning to a relevant team member.\n* It does this by comparing the stale issue against our vector store of resolved issues with the goal of identifying which team member would have best context regarding the issue.\n* In a busy team, this may net a few team members as possible candidates to assign. Therefore, we can introduce additional logic to count each team member's assigned, in-progress issues. This is intended to not overload our busiest members.\n* The team member with the least assigned issues is pressumed to have the most capacity and therefore is assigned. A comennt is left in the issue to notify the team member that they've been auto-assigned due to age of issue.\n\n### How to use\n* Modify the project and interval parameters to match those of your use-case and team members.\n* Add additional criteria before assigning to a team member eg. department, as required.\n\n### Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM\n* JIRA for Issue Management\n* Supabase for Vector Store\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Not using JIRA or Supabase? The beauty of these AI templates are these components are entirely interchangeable with competing services. Try Linear and Qdrant instead!\n* Auto-assigning logic is simplified in this template. Expand criteria as required for your team and organisation. eg. Might be a good idea to pull in annual leave information from HR system to prevent assigning to someone who is on currently on holiday!",
