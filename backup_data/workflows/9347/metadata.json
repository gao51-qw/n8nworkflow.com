  "description": "### How it Works\n\nThis workflow lets you build a **Messenger AI Agent** capable of understanding **text**, **images**, **and voice notes**, and replying intelligently in real time.\n\nIt starts by receiving messages from a Facebook Page via a **Webhook**, detects the message type (text, image, or audio), and routes it through the right branch. Each input is then prepared as a **prompt** and sent to an **AI Agent** that can respond using text generation, perform quick calculations, or fetch information from Wikipedia.\n\nFinally, the answer is formatted and sent back to Messenger via the **Graph API**, creating a smooth, fully automated chat experience.\n\n\n### Set Up Steps\n\n\t1.\tConnect credentials\nAdd your **OpenAI API key** and **Facebook Page Access Token** in n8n credentials.\n\n\t2.\tPlug the webhook\nCopy the Messenger webhook URL from your workflow and paste it into your Facebook Page Developer settings (Webhook → Messages → Subscribe).\n\n\t3.\tCustomize the agent\nEdit the **System Message** of the AI Agent to define tone, temperature, and purpose (e.g. “customer support”, “math assistant”).\n\n\t4.\tEnable memory & tools\nTurn on **Simple Memory** to keep conversation context and activate tools like **Calculator** or **Wikipedia**.\n\n\t5.\tTest & deploy\nSwitch to production mode, test text, image, and voice messages directly from Messenger.\n\n\n### Benefits\n\n💬 **Multi-modal Understanding** — Handles text, images, and audio messages seamlessly.\n⚙️ **Full Automation** — End-to-end workflow from Messenger to AI and back.\n🧠 **Smart Replies** — Uses OpenAI + Wikipedia + Calculator for context-aware answers.\n🚀 **No-Code Setup** — Build your first Messenger AI in less than 30 minutes.\n🔗 **Extensible** — Easily connect more tools or APIs like Airtable, Google Sheets, or Notion.",
