### How it Works

This workflow lets you build a **Messenger AI Agent** capable of understanding **text**, **images**, **and voice notes**, and replying intelligently in real time.

It starts by receiving messages from a Facebook Page via a **Webhook**, detects the message type (text, image, or audio), and routes it through the right branch. Each input is then prepared as a **prompt** and sent to an **AI Agent** that can respond using text generation, perform quick calculations, or fetch information from Wikipedia.

Finally, the answer is formatted and sent back to Messenger via the **Graph API**, creating a smooth, fully automated chat experience.


### Set Up Steps

	1.	Connect credentials
Add your **OpenAI API key** and **Facebook Page Access Token** in n8n credentials.

	2.	Plug the webhook
Copy the Messenger webhook URL from your workflow and paste it into your Facebook Page Developer settings (Webhook → Messages → Subscribe).

	3.	Customize the agent
Edit the **System Message** of the AI Agent to define tone, temperature, and purpose (e.g. “customer support”, “math assistant”).

	4.	Enable memory & tools
Turn on **Simple Memory** to keep conversation context and activate tools like **Calculator** or **Wikipedia**.

	5.	Test & deploy
Switch to production mode, test text, image, and voice messages directly from Messenger.
