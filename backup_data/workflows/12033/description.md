## How It Works
This workflow automates monthly revenue reconciliation across Stripe, PayPal, and bank statements by standardizing data formats, detecting discrepancies, and producing audit-ready reports. It concurrently retrieves revenue data from multiple sources, normalizes datasets into consistent structures, consolidates records, and reconciles transactions against bank statements with intelligent mismatch detection. The system aggregates monthly totals, generates detailed audit reports with clearly flagged discrepancies, archives finalized outputs to Google Drive, and notifies tax agents. Designed for accounting firms, finance teams, and businesses, it enables automated revenue verification, multi-channel reconciliation, discrepancy identification, and compliance audit documentation without manual record matching or error-prone spreadsheet workflows.

## Setup Steps
1. Configure Stripe, PayPal.
2. Set up normalization rules for date, currency, and transaction ID mappings.
3. Connect Google Drive for report archiving and Gmail for agent notifications.
