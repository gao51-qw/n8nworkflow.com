## Who it's for
Project managers, AI builders, and teams who want structured, automated meeting summaries with zero manual work.

2. Point the Drive Trigger to your meeting notes folder.  
3. Paste the system prompt into the AI node.  
4. Set Gmail Email Type to **HTML** and Message to `{{$json.email_html}}`.  
5. Drop a test file and execute once.
