  "description": "![Captura de pantalla 20250828 a las 1.13.15.png](fileId:2267)\n\nThis automation template is a revolutionary AI-powered interior design and product visualization workflow that allows users to seamlessly place any object or artwork into real spaces using artificial intelligence. Upload two photos - one of your product/artwork and another of the target space - and watch as AI intelligently composites them together, then converts the result into a captivating animated video with professional camera movements. The final video is automatically published across TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts for maximum reach.\n\n***Note: This workflow uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) for intelligent image composition and FAL AI's WAN v2.2-a14b model for video generation. Each complete generation costs approximately $0.25 USD, making it an incredibly cost-effective solution for professional-quality content creation.***\n\n## Who Is This For?\n- **Interior Designers & Architects:** Visualize how furniture, artwork, or decor will look in client spaces before making purchases or installations.\n- **Art Dealers & Galleries:** Show potential buyers how paintings or sculptures would appear in their homes or offices with realistic placement and lighting.\n- **E-commerce Retailers:** Create compelling product demonstrations by showing furniture, artwork, or home decor items in realistic room settings.\n- **Real Estate Professionals:** Help clients visualize how their furniture or art collection would look in new properties.\n- **Content Creators & Influencers:** Generate engaging \"before and after\" style content showing product placements in various environments.\n- **Marketing Agencies:** Scale visual content production for furniture brands, art dealers, and home decor companies.\n\n## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve?\nTraditional product visualization requires expensive 3D rendering software, professional photography setups, or costly photoshoot arrangements. This workflow eliminates these barriers by:\n- **Intelligent Object Placement:** AI analyzes both the object/artwork and target space to determine optimal positioning, scale, and lighting integration.\n- **Realistic Integration:** Advanced AI composition ensures shadows, reflections, and lighting match perfectly between the object and environment.\n- **Professional Animation:** Converts static compositions into cinematic videos with smooth camera movements that highlight the placement naturally.\n- **Cost-Effective Production:** At just $0.25 per generation, it's exponentially cheaper than traditional 3D rendering or professional photography.\n- **Instant Multi-Platform Distribution:** Automatically formats and publishes content across all major social media platforms simultaneously.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Dual Image Upload:** Users upload two photos through an intuitive web form:\n   - **Photo 1:** The object, artwork, or furniture piece to be placed\n   - **Photo 2:** The target room or space where the item should appear\n   - **Optional Description:** Additional context about the desired placement\n2. **Image Processing & Hosting:** Both images are automatically uploaded to ImgBB for reliable cloud access throughout the workflow.\n3. **AI-Powered Composition:** Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) analyzes both images and intelligently composites the object into the space, considering:\n   - Proper scale and proportions\n   - Realistic lighting and shadows\n   - Perspective and depth matching\n   - Environmental integration\n4. **Video Generation:** FAL AI's WAN v2.2-a14b model transforms the composed image into a professional 4-second video featuring:\n   - Smooth camera panning movements\n   - Natural motion blur effects\n   - Cinematic framing and composition\n5. **Quality Assurance:** Automated status monitoring ensures successful generation before proceeding to publication.\n6. **Multi-Platform Publishing:** The final video is automatically uploaded to TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts with customizable captions.\n\n## Setup\n1. **FAL AI Credentials:** Create an account at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) and add your API credentials for:\n   - Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) image composition\n   - WAN v2.2-a14b image-to-video conversion\n2. **ImgBB API Setup:** \n   - Sign up at [imgbb.com](https://imgbb.com) for free image hosting\n   - Generate an API key and update the `imgbb_api_key` value in the \"Set APIs Vars\" node\n3. **Upload-Post Configuration:** \n   - Create an account at [upload-post.com](https://upload-post.com)\n   - Connect your TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube accounts\n   - Add your Upload-Post credentials to the \"Upload Post\" node\n4. **Prompt Customization:** In the \"Set Prompts\" node, fine-tune:\n   - `prompt-image-edit`: \"Place the [object] in the room on the back wall, respecting the [object] perfectly and the background room and the camera frame in the photo of the room.\"\n   - `prompt-image-to-video`: Camera movement style and cinematic effects\n5. **Cost Management:** Monitor usage as each generation costs approximately $0.25 USD through the FAL AI services.\n\n## Requirements\n- **Accounts:** n8n, fal.ai, imgbb.com, upload-post.com, social media accounts (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube).\n- **API Keys & Credentials:** FAL AI API token, ImgBB API key, Upload-Post authentication.\n- **Budget:** Approximately $0.25 USD per complete workflow execution.\n- **Social Media Setup:** Business/Creator accounts connected through Upload-Post platform.\n\n## Features\n- **Dual-Image Intelligence:** Sophisticated AI analysis of both object and space for perfect integration\n- **Cost-Effective Processing:** Only $0.25 per generation compared to hundreds for traditional methods\n- **Advanced AI Models:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Nano Banana) + FAL WAN v2.2-a14b for premium quality\n- **Realistic Lighting Integration:** AI matches shadows, reflections, and ambient lighting automatically\n- **Professional Video Output:** Cinematic camera movements optimized for social media engagement\n- **Multi-Platform Optimization:** Automatic formatting for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts\n- **Robust Error Handling:** Built-in retry mechanisms and quality verification\n- **Scalable Production:** Handle multiple object-space combinations efficiently\n\nTransform your product visualization workflow today - simply upload a photo of any object and the space where you want to place it, and let AI create stunning, professional videos that showcase perfect integration for just $0.25 per generation.",
