  "description": "# Zoho CRM - Conversation Intelligence Analyzer\n\nThis workflow automatically processes customer call recordings, transcribes them using OpenAI Whisper, extracts key topics, identifies commitments, analyzes sentiment, generates follow-up suggestions and updates the corresponding Zoho CRM Lead — all without manual efforts.\n\nIt eliminates the need for listening to calls or writing summaries and equips your sales team with instant AI-generated insights.\n\n## ⚡ Quick Start (Fast Setup)\n\n- Import the workflow JSON into n8n.\n- Add Zoho CRM OAuth2 & OpenAI API credentials.\n- Copy the webhook URL and configure your telephony system to POST call recordings.\n- Map Zoho custom fields.\n- Upload a test recording → Confirm CRM updates → Activate workflow.\n\n\n## 📘 What It Does\n\nThis workflow turns every incoming call recording into structured insights which your sales & customer support team can immediately use. When a recording is received, the call is automatically transcribed using OpenAI’s Whisper model. That transcript is then processed by multiple AI nodes that detect topics, customer sentiment, commitments and possible follow-up actions.\n\nAll extracted data — such as mood, sentiment score, subjects, action items and commitments is merged into a clean result object and pushed to the matching Lead in Zoho CRM. The sales team gets ready-to-use call intelligence instantly, improving decision-making, accuracy and speed.\n\nThis automation works 24/7 and replaces hours of manual review work with reliable AI-generated summaries.\n\n\n## 👤 Who’s It For\n\n- Sales & Customer support teams using Zoho CRM.\n- Support teams handling inbound/outbound calls.\n- Businesses wanting call analytics without manual transcription.\n- Zoho CRM admins who want automation with minimal maintenance.\n- Organizations using telephony/VoIP systems that support call exports.\n\n\n## 🧾 Requirements\n\nTo use this workflow, you need:\n\n- An n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- Zoho CRM OAuth2 credentials\n- OpenAI API key (Whisper + GPT models)\n- A telephony system capable of POSTing audio files to a webhook\n- Zoho fields to store: \n\t- Topics\n\t- Main subject\n\t- Action items \n\t- Sentiment \n\t- Mood \n\t- Follow-up text \n\t- Commitments (optional)\n\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works & How to Set Up\n\n### 1.

Sentiment & Mood Analysis\n\nAI analyzes:\n- Customer mood \n- Sales rep tone \n- Overall sentiment \n- Sentiment score \n\n### 6.

Follow-up Generation\n\nGPT generates 3–5 follow-up suggestions based on the transcript & commitments.\n\n### 8. Combine All Insights\n\nA Set node merges transcription, topics, sentiment, commitments and follow-up text.\n\n### 9.
