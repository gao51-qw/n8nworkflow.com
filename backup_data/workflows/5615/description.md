This workflow listens for incoming book request emails, extracts the user's intent using the Ollama LLM, queries book data (title, summary, details) via an API, and sends a personalized recommendation email. Ideal for automated book suggestions using LLMs and structured APIs, great for newsletters, reading clubs, and educational bots.

## How It Works

1. **Email Request:** Triggers the workflow when a new email with a book request is received.
2. **Analyze Email with Ollama:** Extracts user intent and book preferences using the Ollama LLM.
3. **Create Book Search Query:** Generates a query based on the analyzed intent.
4. **Book Search API:** Fetches book data (title, summary, details) from an API.
5. **Check API Response:** Validates the API response for book availability.
6. **Handle No Book Found:** Manages cases where no suitable book is found.
7. **Extract Book Summary:** Pulls the summary from the API response.
8. **Wait for Summary Response:** Pauses to ensure summary data is ready.
9. **Retrieve Book Details:** Gathers additional book details.
10. **Format Book Data:** Structures the book information for the recommendation.
11. **Enhance Data with Code:** Refines the data using custom code.
12. **Generate Email Content:** Creates a personalized email recommendation.
13. **Send Email:** Delivers the recommendation to the user.

## How to Use
