    "description": "**Unleash the power of AI to automate your job search, tailor your applications, and boost your chances of landing your dream job!** This comprehensive workflow handles everything from finding relevant job postings to generating personalized resumes and cover letters.\n\n**Use cases are many:**\n* **Automate your entire job application process:** Spend less time searching and more time preparing for interviews.\n* **Tailor your resume and cover letter for every application:** Maximize your ATS compatibility and stand out to recruiters.\n* **Efficiently track your applications:** Keep all your job search activities organized in one place.\n* **Discover new job opportunities:** Leverage the Adzuna API to find relevant listings.\n\n---\n\n**Good to know:**\n\n* **Free Adzuna API:** This workflow utilizes the *free* Adzuna API, making job search capabilities accessible without initial cost.\n* **OpenRouter Chat Model Costs:** AI model usage (for resume rewriting and cover letter generation) will incur costs based on the OpenRouter pricing model. Please check OpenRouter's official website for updated pricing information.\n* **Model Availability:** The AI models used may have geo-restrictions. If you encounter a \"model not found\" error, it might not be available in your country or region.\n\n---\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1.  **Webhook Trigger:** The workflow is initiated via a webhook, allowing you to trigger it manually or integrate it with other systems (e.g., a form submission with your desired job title and resume).\n2.  **Resume Extraction:** Your uploaded resume (e.g., PDF) is automatically extracted into a readable text format.\n3.  **Job Search (Adzuna API):** Using the provided job title, the workflow queries the Adzuna API to fetch relevant job postings.\n4.  **Job Filtering:** Duplicate job listings are filtered out to ensure you receive unique opportunities.\n5.  **Job Info Extraction:** Key details like job description, company name, and job URL are extracted from each posting.\n6.  **Skills Extraction (AI):** An AI model (OpenRouter) analyzes the job description to identify the top skills and qualifications required.\n7.  **Resume Match Scoring (AI):** Your resume is compared against the extracted job skills by an AI model, generating a compatibility score (1-5).\n8.  **Conditional Resume & Cover Letter Generation:**\n    * **If the resume match score is satisfactory (≥ 3):**\n        * **Tailored Resume Generation (AI):** An AI model rewrites your resume, specifically highlighting the skills and experience most relevant to the target job, in an ATS-friendly and human-readable JSON/HTML format.\n        * **Personalized Cover Letter Generation (AI):** A custom cover letter is drafted by AI, uniquely tailored to the job description and your newly optimized resume, generated as well-formatted HTML.\n9.  **Google Sheets Integration:** The generated cover letter, tailored resume, job URL, and application status are automatically updated in your designated Google Sheet for easy tracking.\n10. **Gmail Notification:** A personalized email containing the generated cover letter, tailored resume, and a direct link to the job posting on Adzuna is sent to your specified email address.\n11. **Webhook Response:** A final text response is sent back via the webhook, summarizing the sent application materials.\n\n---\n\n**How to use:**\n\n* **Manual Trigger:** The workflow is set up with a manual trigger (Webhook) for initial testing and demonstration. You can easily replace this with an n8n form, a scheduled trigger, or integrate it into your existing tools.\n* **Input:** Provide your desired job search keyword and your resume (e.g., as a PDF) to the webhook.\n* **Review & Apply:** Review the AI-generated cover letter and tailored resume sent to your email, then proceed to apply for the job using the provided Adzuna link.\n\n---\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* **n8n Instance:** A running n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).\n* **Adzuna API Key:** A free Adzuna API key (easily obtainable from their developer portal).\n* **OpenRouter Account:** For AI model access (costs apply based on usage).\n* **Google Sheets Account:** To store and track your job applications.\n* **Gmail Account:** To send automated application emails.\n\n---\n\n**Customizing this workflow:**\n\nThis workflow is highly customizable. You can:\n* Integrate with other job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed) using their APIs.\n* Add more sophisticated AI models or custom prompts for even finer control over resume and cover letter generation.\n* Connect to other services for CRM, calendar management, or applicant tracking.\n* Implement different filtering criteria for job postings.\n* Expand the data stored in your Google Sheet (e.g., interview dates, feedback).\n\nStart automating your job search today and streamline your path to career success!",

Keyword Analysis & Integration\n- **Extract Keywords**: Identify all relevant keywords from the job description including:\n  - Technical skills and software\n  - Soft skills and competencies  \n  - Industry terminology and jargon\n  - Required qualifications and certifications\n  - Job titles and role-specific terms\n  - Action verbs used in job requirements\n\n- **Strategic Placement**: Integrate keywords naturally into:\n  - Professional summary (3-4 most critical keywords)\n  - Skills section (comprehensive keyword list)\n  - Work experience descriptions (context-appropriate usage)\n  - Education section (relevant coursework, projects)\n\n- **Keyword Matching Rules**:\n  - Use exact phrasing from job description when possible\n  - Include both full terms and abbreviations (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\")\n  - Maintain natural language flow\n  - Avoid keyword stuffing\n\n### 3. Content Restructuring\n\n#### Professional Summary\n- Create a 3-4 line summary that mirrors the job requirements\n- Lead with the most important keywords for the role\n- Quantify experience where possible\n- Align career trajectory with the position\n\n#### Work Experience\n- Reorder and emphasize experiences most relevant to the target role\n- Rewrite bullet points to incorporate job description keywords\n- Quantify achievements with specific metrics\n- Use action verbs that match the job posting\n- Highlight transferable skills for career changers\n\n#### Skills Section\n- Create a comprehensive skills section with relevant keywords\n- Organize into categories: Technical Skills, Software Proficiency, Languages, Certifications\n- Include both hard and soft skills mentioned in job description\n- Use exact terminology from the posting\n\n#### Education & Certifications\n- Highlight relevant coursework, projects, or academic achievements\n- Include any certifications that match job requirements\n- Add relevant keywords in descriptions\n\n### 4. ATS Compatibility Rules\n- Use standard date formats (MM/YYYY or Month YYYY)\n- Spell out abbreviations at least once\n- Use standard job titles when possible\n- Include city, state format for locations\n- Avoid headers and footers\n- Use clear section breaks\n\n### 5. Quality Assurance\n- Ensure all information remains truthful and accurate\n- Maintain professional tone and readability\n- Verify keyword integration feels natural\n- Check that the resume tells a coherent career story\n- Ensure the final version would appeal to human recruiters\n\n## Output Format\nProvide the optimized resume in clean, ATS-friendly format with:\n\n1. **Optimization Summary**: Brief explanation of key changes made\n2. **Keyword Integration Report**: List of keywords incorporated and their placement\n3. **ATS Compatibility Score**: Your assessment of how well the resume will perform\n4. **Complete Optimized Resume**: Full restructured resume ready for application\n\n## Important Notes\n- Never fabricate experience, skills, or qualifications\n- Focus on reframing existing experience rather than inventing new content\n- Maintain the candidate's authentic voice and career narrative\n- Prioritize the most critical 15-20 keywords rather than trying to include everything\n- Balance ATS optimization with human readability\n\n\nRemember: The goal is to help qualified candidates get past initial ATS screening to reach human recruiters, not to misrepresent their qualifications.\n"
