  "description": "Get automated weather updates delivered directly to your Telegram chat at scheduled intervals. This workflow fetches current weather data from OpenWeatherMap and sends formatted weather reports via a Telegram bot.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Daily morning weather briefings\n- Regular weather monitoring for outdoor activities\n- Automated weather alerts for specific locations\n- Personal weather assistant for travel planning\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore setting up this workflow, ensure you have:\n\n- An OpenWeatherMap API account (free tier available)\n- A Telegram bot token\n- Your Telegram chat ID\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Step 1: Create OpenWeatherMap Account\n1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and sign up for a free account\n2. Navigate to the API keys section in your account\n3. Copy your API key (you'll need this for the workflow configuration)\n\n### Step 2: Create Telegram Bot\n1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`\n2. Start a chat and use the `/newbot` command\n3. Follow the prompts to create your bot and get the bot token\n4. Save the bot token securely\n\n### Step 3: Get Your Telegram Chat ID\n1. Start a conversation with your newly created bot\n2. Send any message to the bot\n3. Visit `https://api.telegram.org/bot&lt;YourBOTToken&gt;/getUpdates` in your browser\n4. Look for your chat ID in the response (it will be a number like `123456789`)\n\n### Step 4: Configure the Workflow\n1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance\n2. Configure each node with your credentials:\n\n#### Schedule Trigger Node\n- Set your preferred schedule (default: daily at 8:00 AM)\n- Use cron expression format (e.g., `0 8 * * *` for 8 AM daily)\n\n#### Get Weather Node\n- Add your OpenWeatherMap credentials\n- Update the `cityName` parameter to your desired location\n- Format: `\"CityName,CountryCode\"` (e.g., `\"London,UK\"`)\n\n#### Send a text message Node\n- Add your Telegram bot credentials (bot token)\n- Replace `XXXXXXX` in the `chatId` field with your actual chat ID\n\n## Customization Options\n\n### Location Settings\nIn the \"Get Weather\" node, modify the `cityName` parameter to change the location. You can specify:\n- City name only: `\"Paris\"`\n- City with country: `\"Paris,FR\"`\n- City with state and country: `\"Miami,FL,US\"`\n\n### Schedule Frequency\nIn the \"Schedule Trigger\" node, adjust the cron expression:\n- Every 6 hours: `0 */6 * * *`\n- Twice daily (8 AM & 6 PM): `0 8,18 * * *`\n- Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM: `0 9 * * 1`\n\n### Message Format\nIn the \"Format Weather\" node, you can customize the message template by modifying the `message` variable in the function code. Current format includes:\n- Current temperature with \"feels like\" temperature\n- Min/max temperatures for the day\n- Weather description and precipitation\n- Wind speed and direction\n- Cloud coverage percentage\n- Sunrise and sunset times\n\n### Language Support\nIn the \"Get Weather\" node, change the `language` parameter to get weather descriptions in different languages:\n- English: `\"en\"`\n- Spanish: `\"es\"`\n- French: `\"fr\"`\n- German: `\"de\"`\n- Polish: `\"pl\"`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n**Weather data not updating:**\n- Verify your OpenWeatherMap API key is valid and active\n- Check if you've exceeded your API rate limits\n- Ensure the city name format is correct\n\n**Messages not being sent:**\n- Confirm your Telegram bot token is correct\n- Verify the chat ID is accurate (should be a number, not username)\n- Make sure you've started a conversation with your bot\n\n**Workflow not triggering:**\n- Check if the workflow is activated (toggle switch should be ON)\n- Verify the cron expression syntax is correct\n- Ensure your n8n instance is running continuously\n\n### Testing the Workflow\n1. Use the \"Test workflow\" button to run manually\n2. Check each node's output for errors\n3. Verify the final message format in Telegram\n\n## Node Descriptions\n\n### Schedule Trigger\nAutomatically starts the workflow based on a cron schedule. Runs at specified intervals to fetch fresh weather data.\n\n### Get Weather\nConnects to OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather conditions for the specified location.\n\n### Format Weather\nProcesses the raw weather data and creates a user-friendly message with emojis and organized information.\n\n### Send a text message\nDelivers the formatted weather report to your Telegram chat using the configured bot.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nYou can extend this workflow by:\n- Adding weather alerts for specific conditions (temperature thresholds, rain warnings)\n- Including weather forecasts for multiple days\n- Sending reports to multiple chat recipients\n- Adding location-based emoji selection\n- Integrating with other notification channels (email, Slack, Discord)\n\n## Security Notes\n\n- Keep your API keys and bot tokens secure\n- Don't share your chat ID publicly\n- Consider using n8n's credential system for storing sensitive information\n- Regularly rotate your API keys for better security\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Arkadiusz, the only person who supports me in n8n mission to make automation great again.\n",
