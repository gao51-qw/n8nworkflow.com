  "description": "# Carbon Footprint Tracker with ScrapeGraphAI Analysis and ESG Reporting Automation\n\n## 🎯 Target Audience\n- Sustainability managers and ESG officers\n- Environmental compliance teams\n- Corporate social responsibility (CSR) managers\n- Energy and facilities managers\n- Supply chain sustainability coordinators\n- Environmental consultants\n- Green building certification teams\n- Climate action plan coordinators\n- Regulatory compliance officers\n- Corporate reporting and disclosure teams\n\n## 🚀 Problem Statement\nManual carbon footprint calculation and ESG reporting is complex, time-consuming, and often inaccurate due to fragmented data sources and outdated emission factors. This template solves the challenge of automatically collecting environmental data, calculating accurate carbon footprints, identifying reduction opportunities, and generating comprehensive ESG reports using AI-powered data collection and automated sustainability workflows.\n\n## 🔧 How it Works\n\nThis workflow automatically collects energy and transportation data using ScrapeGraphAI, calculates comprehensive carbon footprints across all three scopes, identifies reduction opportunities, and generates automated ESG reports for sustainability compliance and reporting.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger** - Runs automatically every day at 8:00 AM to collect environmental data\n2. **Energy Data Scraper** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to extract energy consumption data and emission factors\n3. **Transport Data Scraper** - Collects transportation emission factors and fuel efficiency data\n4. **Footprint Calculator** - Calculates comprehensive carbon footprint across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions\n5. **Reduction Opportunity Finder** - Identifies cost-effective carbon reduction opportunities\n6. **Sustainability Dashboard** - Creates comprehensive sustainability metrics and KPIs\n7. **ESG Report Generator** - Automatically generates ESG compliance reports\n8. **Create Reports Folder** - Organizes reports in Google Drive\n9. **Save Report to Drive** - Stores final reports for stakeholder access\n\n## 📊 Carbon Footprint Analysis Specifications\n\nThe template calculates and tracks the following emission categories:\n\n| Emission Scope | Category | Data Sources | Calculation Method | Example Output |\n|----------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Scope 1 (Direct)** | Natural Gas | EPA emission factors | Consumption × 11.7 lbs CO2/therm | 23,400 lbs CO2 |\n| **Scope 1 (Direct)** | Fleet Fuel | EPA fuel economy data | Miles ÷ MPG × 19.6 lbs CO2/gallon | 11,574 lbs CO2 |\n| **Scope 2 (Electricity)** | Grid Electricity | EPA emission factors | kWh × 0.92 lbs CO2/kWh | 46,000 lbs CO2 |\n| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Employee Commute | EPA transportation data | Miles × 0.77 lbs CO2/mile | 19,250 lbs CO2 |\n| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Air Travel | EPA aviation factors | Miles × 0.53 lbs CO2/mile | 26,500 lbs CO2 |\n| **Scope 3 (Indirect)** | Supply Chain | Estimated factors | Electricity × 0.1 multiplier | 4,600 lbs CO2 |\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n**Estimated setup time: 25-30 minutes**\n\n### Prerequisites\n- n8n instance with community nodes enabled\n- ScrapeGraphAI API account and credentials\n- Google Drive API access for report storage\n- Organizational energy and transportation data\n- ESG reporting requirements and standards\n\n### Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n#### 1. Install Community Nodes\n```bash\n# Install required community nodes\nnpm install n8n-nodes-scrapegraphai\n```\n\n#### 2. Configure ScrapeGraphAI Credentials\n- Navigate to Credentials in your n8n instance\n- Add new ScrapeGraphAI API credentials\n- Enter your API key from ScrapeGraphAI dashboard\n- Test the connection to ensure it's working\n\n#### 3. Set up Schedule Trigger\n- Configure the daily schedule (default: 8:00 AM UTC)\n- Adjust timezone to match your business hours\n- Set appropriate frequency for your reporting needs\n\n#### 4. Configure Data Sources\n- Update the Energy Data Scraper with your energy consumption sources\n- Configure the Transport Data Scraper with your transportation data\n- Set up organizational data inputs (employees, consumption, etc.)\n- Customize emission factors for your region and industry\n\n#### 5. Customize Carbon Calculations\n- Update the Footprint Calculator with your organizational data\n- Configure scope boundaries and calculation methodologies\n- Set up industry-specific emission factors\n- Adjust for renewable energy and offset programs\n\n#### 6. Configure Reduction Analysis\n- Update the Reduction Opportunity Finder with your investment criteria\n- Set up cost-benefit analysis parameters\n- Configure priority scoring algorithms\n- Define implementation timelines and effort levels\n\n#### 7. Set up Report Generation\n- Configure Google Drive integration for report storage\n- Set up ESG report templates and formats\n- Define stakeholder access and permissions\n- Test report generation and delivery\n\n#### 8. Test and Validate\n- Run the workflow manually with test data\n- Verify all calculation steps complete successfully\n- Check data accuracy and emission factor validity\n- Validate ESG report compliance and formatting\n\n## 🔄 Workflow Customization Options\n\n### Modify Data Collection\n- Add more energy data sources (renewables, waste, etc.)\n- Include additional transportation modes (rail, shipping, etc.)\n- Integrate with building management systems\n- Add real-time monitoring and IoT data sources\n\n### Extend Calculation Framework\n- Add more Scope 3 categories (waste, water, etc.)\n- Implement industry-specific calculation methodologies\n- Include carbon offset and credit tracking\n- Add lifecycle assessment (LCA) capabilities\n\n### Customize Reduction Analysis\n- Add more sophisticated ROI calculations\n- Implement scenario modeling and forecasting\n- Include regulatory compliance tracking\n- Add stakeholder engagement metrics\n\n### Output Customization\n- Add integration with sustainability reporting platforms\n- Implement automated stakeholder notifications\n- Create executive dashboards and visualizations\n- Add compliance monitoring and alert systems\n\n## 📈 Use Cases\n\n- **ESG Compliance Reporting**: Automate sustainability disclosure requirements\n- **Carbon Reduction Planning**: Identify and prioritize reduction opportunities\n- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet environmental reporting mandates\n- **Stakeholder Communication**: Generate transparent sustainability reports\n- **Investment Due Diligence**: Provide ESG data for investors and lenders\n- **Supply Chain Sustainability**: Track and report on Scope 3 emissions\n\n## 🚨 Important Notes\n\n- Respect data source terms of service and rate limits\n- Implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid rate limiting\n- Regularly review and update emission factors for accuracy\n- Monitor API usage to manage costs effectively\n- Keep your credentials secure and rotate them regularly\n- Ensure compliance with local environmental reporting regulations\n- Validate calculations against industry standards and methodologies\n- Maintain proper documentation for audit and verification purposes\n\n## 🔧 Troubleshooting\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI connection errors: Verify API key and account status\n- Data source access issues: Check website accessibility and rate limits\n- Calculation errors: Verify emission factors and organizational data\n- Report generation failures: Check Google Drive permissions and quotas\n- Schedule trigger failures: Check timezone and cron expression\n- Data accuracy issues: Validate against manual calculations and industry benchmarks\n\n**Support Resources:**\n- ScrapeGraphAI documentation and API reference\n- n8n community forums for workflow assistance\n- EPA emission factor databases and methodologies\n- GHG Protocol standards and calculation guidelines\n- ESG reporting frameworks and compliance requirements\n- Sustainability reporting best practices and standards\n",
