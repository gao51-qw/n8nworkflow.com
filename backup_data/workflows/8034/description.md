"*I used to spend hours every week just copy-pasting product descriptions to find the right tariff codes for our international shipments. It was tedious and prone to errors.*" - Accounting specialist.


This workflow eliminates that manual work entirely. It automatically finds customs tariff numbers (also known as HS Codes or "Zolltarifnummern") for your products and enriches your data in Google Sheets. It offers two powerful modes: bulk processing for entire product lists and an on-demand chat interface for quick single lookups.

## new features
- added the API score in percentage (80 to 100% is perfect, 70-80% still good)
- added description of the found HS Code to better verify the accuracy
-please keep in mind, that is still a **beta**
