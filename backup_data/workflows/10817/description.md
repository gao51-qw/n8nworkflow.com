## How it works
This workflow listens for new products in Shopify and transforms the product data into polished social media content. It generates captions and hashtags using an AI model, then posts the product to Instagram and Facebook using the Facebook Graph API. It logs every post to Google Sheets and sends a confirmation message to Discord. The flow ensures consistent publishing across all platforms with automated formatting and tracking.

## Step-by-step

- **Trigger on Shopify product creation**

  - **Create Instagram Media Container** – Sends the image and caption to create a media container.  
  - **Wait for Processing** – Waits for the container to finish processing.  
  - **Publish Instagram Media** – Publishes the processed container to the Instagram feed.

- **Publish to Facebook**  
  - **Download Image for Facebook** – Downloads the product image from Shopify.  
  - **Post to Facebook Page** – Uploads the image with the caption and hashtags to the Facebook Page.

- **Merge publishing results**  
  - **Merge** – Combines responses from Instagram and Facebook for unified logging.

- **Log post to Google Sheets**
