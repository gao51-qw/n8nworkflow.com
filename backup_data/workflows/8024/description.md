This workflow pulls articles from multiple RSS feeds, filters them by date, fetches the full webpage content, and summarizes each article into a clean, structured Markdown format using **Google Gemini (via LangChain)**. Summaries are automatically saved into Google Sheets for long-term storage and into a daily sheet for fresh news.

👉 Example Google Sheet (pre-configured for this workflow):
