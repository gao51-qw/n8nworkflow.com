## How It Works

This workflow automates the complete end-to-end processing of daily revenue transactions for finance and accounting teams. It systematically retrieves, validates, and standardizes transaction data from multiple sources, computes applicable tax obligations, identifies anomalies, and generates regulatory compliance reports. Designed primarily for accountants and financial analysts, it significantly reduces manual workload, improves the accuracy of tax calculations, and automates submission to relevant authorities. Transaction data flows through integrated sources, undergoes validation and AI-driven tax assessment, and ultimately produces well-formatted reports ready for secure archiving or automated email distribution.
