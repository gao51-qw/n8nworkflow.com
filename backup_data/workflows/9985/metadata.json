  "description": "## Analyze Trustpilot & Sitejabber sentiment with Decodo + Gemini to Sheets\n\nSign up for Decodo [HERE](https://visit.decodo.com/discount) for Discount\n\nThis template scrapes public reviews from **Trustpilot** and **Sitejabber** with a Decodo tool, converts findings into a **flat, spreadsheet-ready JSON**, generates a concise sentiment summary with **Gemini**, and appends everything to **Google Sheets**. It’s ideal for reputation snapshots, competitive analysis, or lightweight BI pipelines that need structured data and a quick narrative.\n\n## Who’s it for?\nMarketing teams, growth analysts, founders, and agencies who need repeatable review collection and sentiment summaries without writing custom scrapers or manual copy/paste.\n\n## How it works\n1. A **Form Trigger** collects the *Business Name or URL*.\n2. **Set (Config Variables)** stores `business_name`, `spreadsheet_id`, and `sheet_id`.\n3. The **Agent** orchestrates the Decodo tool and enforces a **strict JSON schema** with at most **10 reviews per source**.\n4. **Gemini** writes a succinct summary and recommendations, noting missing sources with: “There’s no data in this website.”\n5. A **Merge** node combines JSON fields with the narrative.\n6. **Google Sheets** appends a row.\n\n## How to set up\n1. Add **Google Sheets**, **Gemini**, and **Decodo** credentials in Credential Manager.\n2. Replace `(YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID)` and `(YOUR_SHEET_ID)` in **Set: Config Variables**.\n3. In **Google Sheets**, select **Define below** and map each column explicitly.\n4. Keep the parser and agent connections intact to guarantee flat JSON.\n5. Activate, open the form URL, submit a business, and verify the appended row.\n",
