  "description": "\n## Use Case\n\nManaging SSL certificates manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to unexpected downtime or security risks due to expired certificates.\n\n## What This Workflow Does\n\nThis workflow automatically monitors SSL certificates for a list of websites, checks their expiry status using SSL-Checker.io, and sends timely notifications if a certificate is about to expire.\n\n## Setup\nAdd your credentials for Google Sheets, Gmail, and SSL-Checker.io.\n\nCreate a Google Sheet with a list of URLs for the websites you want to monitor.\n\nConfigure the workflow to check the SSL status weekly.\n\nSet up email notifications to alert you when a certificate is close to expiry.\n\nActivate the workflow to automate monitoring and notification.\n\n## How to Adjust It to Your Needs\n\n- Customize the URL Source: Replace Google Sheets with another data source like Airtable or CSV files.\n- Modify Notification Thresholds: Change the expiry threshold (e.g., notify for 14 days instead of 7).\n- Add Additional Actions: Integrate with tools like Slack or Teams for team-wide notifications.\n- Automate Renewal Requests: Add a step to send renewal requests directly to your SSL provider if a certificate is nearing expiry.",
