Tech Startup (150 Engineers)\nEngineer requests \"Advanced Kubernetes\" training. AI identifies skill gap as \"high severity\" due to upcoming cloud migration project. Checks department budget ($22K remaining of $50K), recommends $1,800 4-day course with 92% match score. Auto-routes to engineering manager with business impact analysis. Manager approves in 2 hours. Training scheduled for next month. Post-training, engineer leads internal workshop, multiplying impact across 10-person team. Migration completes 3 weeks early, saving $50K.\n2. Enterprise Sales Org (500 Reps)\nSales rep requests \"Negotiation Mastery\" after losing 3 deals. AI assesses urgency as \"justified\" based on revenue impact. Recommends $1,100 2-day course but also suggests lower-cost alternative: internal mentoring from top performer ($0). Manager sees both options, chooses mentoring first. Rep closes next deal with new techniques. Training budget preserved for broader team enablement. ROI: $200K deal closed with $0 training spend.\n3. Healthcare System (2,000 Nurses)\nNurse requests ACLS recertification. AI flags as \"compliance-critical\" with \"immediate\" urgency (expiring in 30 days). Checks budget, finds sufficient funds. Auto-approves and schedules next available session. Sends pre-training materials 1 week before. Tracks attendance, generates certificate upon completion. Updates nurse's credential profile in HRIS. Compliance maintained, no manual intervention needed.\n4. Financial Services Firm\nAnalyst requests CFA Level 1 prep course ($2,500). AI assesses as \"high ROI\" but identifies budget constraint (department at 95% utilization). Recommends deferring to next quarter when new budget allocated. Suggests free Khan Academy courses as interim solution. Manager sees complete analysis, approves deferral, adds analyst to Q2 priority list. Transparent communication maintains morale despite delay.\n5. Manufacturing Company\nMaintenance tech requests PLC programming training. AI identifies 5 other techs with same skill gap. Recommends group training session ($1,200 per person vs $2,000 individual). Calculates team multiplier effect: 6 techs trained = reduced downtime across 3 shifts. Manager approves group session, saving $4,800. All 6 techs complete training together, creating peer support network. Equipment downtime reduced 40%.\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n1.
