Description
Automatically evaluates and maps AI governance responses to ISO 42001:2023 clause requirements using AI-powered logic. Designed for GRC consultants, audit teams, and AI-focused security programs to reduce time spent on manual clause interpretation and alignment.

Who’s It For:
GRC Consultants handling AI governance controls

Internal Auditors preparing for ISO 42001 audits

Security teams implementing AI assurance frameworks

Organizations adopting Responsible AI principles

How It Works:
Triggers manually or on schedule (e.g., clause review cycles)

Reads AI control responses from a connected Google Sheet

Uses AI to evaluate each response against ISO 42001 clauses

Flags compliance status (match / partial / gap) with clause mapping

Outputs a clean control map with automated summary

Requirements:
Gmail or SMTP node for email

Google Sheets connected (OAuth)

OpenAI or AI node (optional but recommended for advanced clause interpretation)

Google Sheet Requirements:
Columns: ClauseID, Clause_Description, Control_Response, Evaluation_Result

Each row must correspond to one ISO 42001 clause

Headers in the first row

Optional: add column for Suggested_Remediation

File Templates:
ISO42001_Mapping_Template.xlsx

Includes: clause ID, clause text, response, result, suggested fix

Customization Tips:
Modify clause response logic in the evaluation node (e.g., strict vs lenient mapping)

Enable multi-framework mapping (e.g., align to NIST AI RMF as well)

Auto-send mapping result to Drive or S3 as audit evidence

Ethics & Compliance:
This module assists with clause interpretation and reporting only. It does not simulate AI models or assess ethical risk directly. For internal reporting, policy alignment, and audit preparation use only.

Setup Instructions:
Copy the provided Google Sheet template (ISO42001_Mapping_Template.xlsx)

Fill in your control responses (row = clause)

Connect Google Sheets node using OAuth credentials

In the AI node:

Evaluate clause response using GPT or internal prompt

Flag match/partial/gap

Optional: auto-send report via email or upload to storage

Review results and update your compliance register accordingly

Supports:
ISO 42001:2023

AI Governance Principles (OECD, NIST AI RMF)

SOCI Act compliance efforts (AI assurance layer)
