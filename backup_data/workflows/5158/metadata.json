  "description": "The **Sound Effects Generator** is an automated workflow that allows users to create realistic sound effects using AI and save them directly to Google Drive. It generates high-quality sound effects (up to 30 seconds long) based on user prompts.\n\n---\n### How It Works:\n\n1. **User Input via Web Form**\n   A form is presented to the user asking for:\n\n   * A **prompt** describing the sound (e.g. \"waves crashing\", \"laser blast\").\n   * A **duration** in seconds (up to 30 seconds).\n\n2. **API Request to Generate Audio**\n   The input is sent to CassetteAI via a `POST` request using API with proper authentication.\n\n3. **Status Polling**\n   The workflow waits for 10 seconds and then checks the status of the request.\n\n4. **Conditional Flow**\n\n   * If the audio generation is complete (`COMPLETED`), it proceeds to fetch the audio file URL.\n   * If not, it waits and retries.\n\n5. **Download & Save**\n\n   * The audio file is downloaded from the URL.\n   * It is automatically uploaded to a specific folder in the user’s **Google Drive**, with a timestamped filename.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Advantages**\n\n* **Fast & Efficient**: Generates up to 30 seconds of audio in just 1 second of processing time.\n* **No Coding Required**: Entire flow can be triggered via a simple form interface.\n* **Automated Storage**: Files are automatically saved to a preconfigured Google Drive folder.\n* **Scalable**: Can be reused for multiple projects by simply changing the input prompts.\n* **Secure**: Uses secure API key-based authentication for interaction with Fal.run and Google Drive.\n* **Customizable**: Easy to adapt or extend—for example, sending download links via email or Telegram.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Form Submission**: The workflow starts with a form where users input a prompt and the desired duration (max 30 seconds) for the sound effect.  \n2. **Audio Creation**: The submitted data is sent to the CassetteAI Sound Effects Generator API via an HTTP request, which initiates the sound effect generation process.  \n3. **Status Check**: The workflow periodically checks the status of the request. If the status is \"COMPLETED,\" it proceeds to fetch the audio file.  \n4. **Audio Retrieval**: The generated audio file is downloaded from the provided URL and uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder, with a timestamped filename for organization.  \n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **API Key Configuration**:  \n   - Create an account on [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/) and obtain an API key.  \n   - In the \"Create audio\" node, set the \"Header Auth\" with:  \n     - **Name**: `Authorization`  \n     - **Value**: `Key YOURAPIKEY` (replace `YOURAPIKEY` with your actual API key).  \n\n2. **Google Drive Integration**:  \n   - Ensure the Google Drive node is configured with the correct OAuth2 credentials and folder ID.  \n   - Adjust the folder ID in the \"Upload Audio\" node if a different destination is preferred.  \n\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
