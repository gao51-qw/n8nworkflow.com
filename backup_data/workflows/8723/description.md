# Coach Onboarding & Training Automation - Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Google Sheets account

## Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Settings Node
Update the "Configuration Settings" node with:

- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Your Twilio number (format: +1XXXXXXXXXX)
- `BUSINESS_NAME`: Your company name
- `TRAINING_PROGRAM_NAME`: Your program name
- `MAIN_PRODUCT_NAME`: Your main product/service

### 2. Create Google Sheets Database

Create a new Google Sheet with 2 tabs:

**Sheet1 (Coaches) - Column headers:**

Name | Phone | Email | Goals | Status | Start Date | Current Day | Last Contact

**Sheet2 (Training Content) - Column headers:**

Day | Topic | Message | Audio_URL

Add your 30-day training content to Sheet2 (rows 1-30).

### 3. Setup Credentials in n8n

- Name: "Google Sheets account"
- Follow Google OAuth setup in n8n

**Twilio API:**

### 4. Configure Webhooks

**Registration Webhook:** `/webhook/coach-registration`
- Accepts POST with: name, phone, email, goals

**Response Webhook:** `/webhook/coach-response`
- Configure in Twilio for incoming SMS

### 5. Activate Workflow

Enable the workflow and test with sample data.

## Testing

Test registration:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n-url/webhook/coach-registration \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
