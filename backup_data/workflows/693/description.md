This workflow will gather data every minute from the GitHub (https://github.com), Docker (https://www.docker.com/), npm (https://www.npmjs.com/) and Product Hunt (https://www.producthunt.com/) website APIs and display select information on a Smashing (https://smashing.github.io/) dashboard.

For convenience sake, the dashboard piece can be easily downloaded as a docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/tephlon/n8n_dashboard) and installed into your docker environment.
