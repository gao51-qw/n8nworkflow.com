This AI Agent helps you create short links from your original URLs.  
Each generated short link is automatically stored in a database table for easy management and tracking.

---

## How It Works

1. Provide a long URL to the Agent.  
2. The Agent saves your original link in the database.  
3. It generates a short link in the following format:

```
Short link:  https://{webhook_url}/webhook/shortLink?q={shortLinkId}
```

When users open the short link, they are automatically redirected to your original link.

## How to Use

- Send your link to the Agent.  
- The Agent will respond with a generated short link.

## Requirements
