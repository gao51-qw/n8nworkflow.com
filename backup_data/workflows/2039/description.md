## About the workflow
The workflow reads every reply that is received from a cold email campaign and qualifies if the lead is interested in a meeting. If the lead is interested, a deal is made in pipedrive. You can add as many email inboxes as you need!

## Setup:
- Add credentials to the Gmail, OpenAI and Pipedrive Nodes.
- Add a in_campaign field in Pipedrive for persons. In Pipedrive click on your credentials at the top right, go to company settings &gt; Data fields &gt; Person and click on add custom field. Single option [TRUE/FALSE].
- If you have only one email inbox, you can delete one of the Gmail nodes.
- If you have more than two email inboxes, you can duplicate a Gmail node as many times as you like. Just connect it to the Get email node, and you are good to go!
- In the Gmail inbox nodes, select Inbox under label names and uncheck Simplify.
