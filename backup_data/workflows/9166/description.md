### How it works
• Twilio webhook detects missed/unanswered calls automatically
• Analyzes call context (time of day, business hours, weekend/weekday)
• Checks CRM for existing customer data and purchase history (optional)
• AI Chain (GPT-4o) generates personalized recovery messages for SMS and Email
• Sends instant apology with booking link via SMS and/or Email
• Logs all interactions to Airtable for tracking
• Slack alerts sales team with customer priority and context
• Waits 24 hours and checks if customer booked
• Sends automatic follow-up SMS if no booking detected
• Structured output parser ensures reliable JSON formatting

### Set up steps
• **Time to set up:** 15-20 minutes
• Add Twilio credential and configure phone number in both SMS nodes
• Get Slack channel ID for sales team alerts
• Create Airtable base with 10 columns (Caller_Number, Customer_Name, Call_Time, Priority, SMS_Sent, Email_Sent, Booking_Link, Status, Urgency_Score, Follow_Up_Date)
• Replace booking URL with your Cal.com or Calendly link
• Configure business email for SMTP sending
• Update business phone and name in follow-up SMS
• Add credentials: Twilio API, OpenAI (GPT-4o), Slack OAuth2, Airtable Token, SMTP Email
• Replace placeholder IDs in Slack and Airtable nodes
• Optional: Configure CRM API for existing customer lookup (or disable those nodes)
