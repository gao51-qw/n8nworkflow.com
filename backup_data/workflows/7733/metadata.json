But could be adjusted for many other creations as well.\n\n### How it works\n* It will run automatically every 6:00 AM\n* Get latest News from TechRadar\n* Parse it into readable JSON\n* AI will decide, which news resonates with your profile\n* Then give the title and description of that news to generate the final linkedin carousal content.\n* This step is also trigerred by Form trigger\n* After carousal generation, it will give it to Post Nitro to create images on that content. \n* Post Nitro provides the PDF file.\n* We Upload the PDf file to Linkedin and get the file ID, in next step, it will be used.\n* Finally create the Post description and Post it to Linkedin\n\n### How to use\n* It will run every 6:00 AM automatically. Just make it Live\n* Submit the form, with correct title and description ( i did not added tests for that so must give that correct 😅 )\n\n### Requirements\n* Install Post Nitro community Node\n@postnitro/n8n-nodes-postnitro-ai\n\n* We need the following API keys to make it work\n1.
