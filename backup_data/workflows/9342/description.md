## **🤖 Automated YouTube Script Generator (Shorts & Long-Form)**

This workflow is a content multiplier. Provide a single video topic via a form, and it automatically researches, outlines, and writes two separate scripts: one for a **YouTube Shorts** and another for a **Long-form video**, saving both directly to Google Docs.

---

### **✨ Key Features**

- **Dual-Format Output:** Creates tailored scripts for both Shorts and long-form videos from one idea.
- **AI-Powered Writing:** Uses **Google Gemini** for all creative steps, from building a structured outline to writing the final scripts.
- **Up-to-Date Research:** Integrates **Tavily AI** to pull fresh, relevant information from the web.
- **Fully Automated:** An end-to-end process that takes a form submission and delivers final documents to your Google Drive with no manual steps.

### **⚙️ How It Works**

After a topic is submitted, the workflow splits into two parallel branches:

1.  **The Shorts Branch:** This path is built for speed. It performs a quick web search and immediately uses an AI agent to write a short, punchy script.
2.  **The Long-Form Branch:** This path focuses on structure. It conducts a web search, uses an AI agent to first create a detailed outline, and then uses another AI agent to write a comprehensive script based on that outline.

### **🔑 Prerequisites**
