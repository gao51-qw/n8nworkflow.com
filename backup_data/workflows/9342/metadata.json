  "description": "## **🤖 Automated YouTube Script Generator (Shorts & Long-Form)**\n\nThis workflow is a content multiplier. Provide a single video topic via a form, and it automatically researches, outlines, and writes two separate scripts: one for a **YouTube Shorts** and another for a **Long-form video**, saving both directly to Google Docs.\n\n---\n\n### **✨ Key Features**\n\n- **Dual-Format Output:** Creates tailored scripts for both Shorts and long-form videos from one idea.\n- **AI-Powered Writing:** Uses **Google Gemini** for all creative steps, from building a structured outline to writing the final scripts.\n- **Up-to-Date Research:** Integrates **Tavily AI** to pull fresh, relevant information from the web.\n- **Fully Automated:** An end-to-end process that takes a form submission and delivers final documents to your Google Drive with no manual steps.\n\n---\n\n### **⚙️ How It Works**\n\nAfter a topic is submitted, the workflow splits into two parallel branches:\n\n1.  **The Shorts Branch:** This path is built for speed. It performs a quick web search and immediately uses an AI agent to write a short, punchy script.\n2.  **The Long-Form Branch:** This path focuses on structure. It conducts a web search, uses an AI agent to first create a detailed outline, and then uses another AI agent to write a comprehensive script based on that outline.\n\n---\n\n### **🔑 Prerequisites**\n\n- An active n8n instance.\n- A form to submit your video topic.\n- API keys for **Tavily AI** and **Google Gemini**.\n- Google Account credentials (OAuth2) configured in n8n for **Google Docs**.\n\n---\n\n### **🛠️ Setup Guide**\n\n1.  **On form submission Trigger:** Configure your form to accept a field for your video topic (e.g., a field named `topic`).\n2.  **Tavily Nodes:** In both `Tavily` nodes, select or create your Tavily API credential and paste in your **API key**.\n3.  **Google Gemini Chat Model:** In the nodes labeled `AI Agent` and `Create Outline`, select your Google AI credential linked to your Gemini **API key**.\n4.  **Google Docs Nodes:** For all four Google Docs nodes (`Create Doc`, `Update Doc`, etc.), select your **Google OAuth2** credential.\n5. **Activate the Workflow:** Once all credentials are in place, save and activate the workflow.\n\n---\n\n### **🚀 How to Use**\n\n1.  **Activate** the workflow.\n2.  **Submit** your topic via the connected form.\n3.  **Check** your Google Drive a few moments later for your the new script!",
