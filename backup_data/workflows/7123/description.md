# 🎙️ VoiceScribe AI: Telegram Audio Message Auto Transcription with OpenAI Whisper
&gt; Automatically transcribe Telegram voice messages and store them as structured logs in Google Sheets, while backing up the audio in Google Drive.

## 🧑‍💼 Who’s it for

- Journalists, content creators, or busy professionals who often record voice memos or short interviews on the go.
- Anyone who wants to turn voice recordings into searchable, structured notes.

## ⚙️ How it works / What it does

1. User sends a voice message to a Telegram bot.
2. n8n checks if the message is an audio voice note.
3. If valid, it downloads the audio file and:
   - Transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper (or your LLM of choice).
   - Uploads the original audio to Google Drive for safekeeping.
4. The transcript and audio metadata are merged.
5. The workflow:
   - Logs the data into a Google Sheet.
   - Sends a formatted confirmation message to the user via Telegram.

If the input is not audio, the bot politely informs the user that only voice messages are accepted.
