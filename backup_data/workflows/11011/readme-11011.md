# Analyze customer sentiment with Zoho CRM, Google Gemini & send Gmail alerts

> # Zoho CRM → AI Sentiment Analysis for customer interactions & Automatic Alerts Workflow

This workflow analyzes newly created Notes (in Any module) in Zoho CRM, detects customer sentiment using an AI model, updates the related CRM record with custom fields - sentiment label and score, and sends an instant alert whenever negative sentiment is detected. It runs on a scheduled interval and gives teams real-time visibility into customer emotions and potential risks.

### Quick Implementation Steps
1. Connect Zoho CRM OAuth2 credentials 
2. Add custom fields in Zoho CRM: `Sentiment_Label` and `Sentiment_Score` 
3. Add AI provider credentials 
4. Set Gmail alert recipient 
5. Activate workflow and test by adding a Note 

## What It Does
This workflow automatically monitors Zoho CRM Notes. When a new Note is detected, the text is extracted and analyzed through an AI-powered sentiment model. The AI classifies the text as Positive, Neutral or Negative and produces a numeric sentiment score.

The workflow updates the related CRM module with these values. If the sentiment is negative, a Gmail alert is triggered so your team can follow up quickly. This automation helps organizations maintain high customer satisfaction and detect potential issues early.

## Who’s It For
- Support teams 
- Sales teams 
- CRM administrators 
- Customer success managers 
- Businesses needing automated customer sentiment tracking 

## Requirements
- n8n instance 
- Zoho CRM OAuth2 credentials 
- Gmail OAuth2 credentials 
- AI provider key 
- Custom fields in Zoho CRM: Sentiment_Label & Sentiment_Score (if you are using different field name then do changes in workflow accoredingly)

## How It Works & Setup

### Step 1: Schedule Trigger
Runs periodically to check for new or updated Notes.

### Step 2: Fetch Latest Note
Retrieves the most recently modified Note.

### Step 3: Extract Details
Extracts Note text, note_id, parent_id and module name.

### Step 4: AI Sentiment Analysis
Sends text to the AI (via LangChain chain) for sentiment classification.

### Step 5: Conditional Branching
- If Negative: Send Gmail alert and update CRM 
- Otherwise: Just update CRM 

### Step 6: Update CRM
Writes sentiment data back into the related parent record.

## How to Customize Nodes
- Adjust sentiment output by modifying the AI prompt.
- Change field mappings in Zoho update nodes.
