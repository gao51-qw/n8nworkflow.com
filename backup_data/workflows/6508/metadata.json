  "title": "CYBERPULSE AI RedOps: Role-based LinkedIn profile discovery with Google OSINT",
  "description": "## Description:\nAutomates public profile discovery for CISO, CEO, and other key roles using Google Programmable Search. Extracts LinkedIn profile links, names, and timestamps to a structured Google Sheet for OSINT, exposure analysis, or Red Team prep.\n\n## Who’s It For:\nRed Teams planning phishing simulations\n\nOSINT investigators and social engineers\n\nCybersecurity trainers mapping exposure risk\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis workflow simulates role-based OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) by performing automated LinkedIn discovery using Google Search. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Trigger**: \n   - Can run manually or via Cron for daily/weekly scraping tasks.\n\n2. **Load Roles to Target**: \n   - Reads role-based search queries (e.g., `\"CISO site:linkedin.com/in/\"`) from a pre-filled input list or Google Sheet.\n\n3. **Query Google Custom Search API**: \n   - Sends requests to the Programmable Search Engine using secure API credentials (CSE ID + API Key).\n   - Each query returns up to 10 LinkedIn profile results.\n\n4. **Parse and Extract**:  \n   - Captures full name, title snippet, LinkedIn URL, and description using JSON response parsing.\n\n5. **Output**:  \n   - Logs results to a structured Google Sheet for review or later enrichment.\n   - Sheet columns include: `role`, `name`, `snippet`, `url`, `timestamp`\n\nOptional enhancements can include:\n- Entity tagging by organization\n- Filtering by location or keyword\n- Lead scoring based on search terms\n- Search query editing\n- \n## Requirements:\nGoogle Programmable Search Engine (API key + CX ID)\n\nGoogle Sheets credentials\n\n## File Templates:\nRedOps_SocialGraph_Log_Template.xlsx\n\nname\tlinkedin\tteam\tstatus\tmodule\ttimestamp\nJohn Doe\thttps://linkedin.com/in/johndoe\tGRC\tactive\tSocial_Graph_Builder\t2025-07-27T12:00:00Z\n\n## Customization Tips:\nUpdate queries (CISO, CEO, VP IT, etc.)\n\nFilter results by region or org using site filters\n\nExtend to track Twitter or GitHub links\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. Set up a Google Programmable Search Engine (CSE) at https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/\n2. Restrict it to search only `linkedin.com/in/`\n3. Copy your **CSE ID** and generate a **Google API Key** from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials\n4. In n8n, use the HTTP Request node:\n   - Select `Use Authentication: Yes`\n   - Store your API Key and CSE ID in n8n credentials (not in query parameters)\n5. Configure pagination to extract multiple results\n6. Optional: Append results to Google Sheets or another storage system\n\n## Ethics Note:\nThis tool uses public Google Search results. It is meant for educational or internal red teaming only. Do not use for scraping or unauthorized targeting.\n\n🔗 Part of the CYBERPULSE AI RedOps Suite\n🌐 https://cyberpulsesolutions.com\n📧 info@cyberpulsesolutions.com",
