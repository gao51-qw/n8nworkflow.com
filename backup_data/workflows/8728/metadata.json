  "description": "This workflow streamlines how employees request **equipment/items** and how those requests reach the **Procurement** team. It validates the employee by enrollment number, detects whether a **manager** exists, and then either requests approval (if the requester has a manager) or routes the request **directly to Procurement** (if the requester is a manager). All messages are written in a professional tone using an LLM, and emails are sent via Gmail with a built-in **approve/deny** step for managers.\n\n## Who’s it for\n\nHR/IT/Operations teams that handle equipment requests, need a lightweight approval flow, and want clean, professional emails without manual drafting.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Employee submits their **enrollment number**.\n2. Workflow fetches employee (and manager, if any).\n3. Employee describes the requested item(s).\n4. If a manager exists → an **approval email** (double opt-in) is sent to the manager.\n\n   * Approved → notify employee and forward a polished request to **Procurement**.\n   * Denied → notify employee.\n5. If the requester is a **manager** → skip approval and send directly to **Procurement**.\n6. End pages confirm the outcome.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* MySQL (or compatible DB) with an `employees` table (`id, name, email, enrollment_number, manager`).\n* Gmail credentials (OAuth) in n8n.\n* LLM provider (OpenAI or compatible) for message polishing.\n\n## How to customize\n\n* Replace the Procurement **NoOp** nodes with your email, helpdesk, or ERP integration.\n* Adjust email copy and tone in the LLM prompt nodes.\n* Add tracking IDs, SLA text, or CCs for auditing.\n* Style the forms with your brand (CSS blocks provided).\n",
