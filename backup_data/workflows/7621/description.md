# Complete account-based outreach automation with Octave context engine

## Who is this for?
Revenue teams, account-based marketing professionals, and growth operators who want a complete, automated pipeline from account identification to contextualized outreach. Built for teams ready to move beyond fragmented point solutions to an integrated, context-aware GTM engine.

## What problem does this solve?
Most GTM teams are flying blind with disconnected tools that can't talk to each other. You qualify accounts in one system, find contacts in another, research context manually, then hope your email sequences land. Each step loses context, and by the time you're writing outreach, you've forgotten why the account was qualified in the first place. Octave centralizes all this typically fragmented context - your ICP definitions, personas, value propositions, and business logic - so every agent operation can act on the same unified understanding of your market. This workflow demonstrates how Octave's agents work together seamlessly because they all share the same context foundation.

## What this workflow does

**Complete Account-to-Outreach Pipeline:**
This workflow demonstrates the full power of Octave's context engine by connecting multiple agent operations in a seamless flow. Unlike traditional tools that lose context at each handoff, Octave centralizes your business context - ICP definitions, personas, value propositions, competitive positioning - so every agent operates from the same unified understanding of your market.

**External Context Research:**
- Gathers real-time external data about target accounts (job postings, news, funding, etc.)
- Processes this information to create runtime context for later use in outreach
- Establishes the "why reach out now" foundation for the entire workflow

**Company-Level Qualification:**
- Uses Octave's company qualification to assess account fit against your specific offering
- Leverages Product and Segment-level fit criteria defined in your Library
- Filters out accounts that don't meet your qualification thresholds
- Ensures only high-potential accounts proceed through the workflow

**Intelligent Contact Discovery:**
- Runs Octave's prospector agent on qualified accounts
- Finds relevant stakeholders based on responsibilities and business context, not just job titles
- Discovers multiple contacts per account for comprehensive coverage
- Maintains qualification context when identifying the right people

**Runtime Context Integration:**
- Takes the external context gathered at the beginning and injects it into sequence generation
- Creates truly dynamic, timely outreach that references current company events
- Generates sequences that feel impossibly relevant and well-researched

**Multi-Contact Sequence Generation:**
- Splits discovered contacts into individual records for processing
- Generates contextualized email sequences for each contact
- Maintains account-level context while creating contact-specific messaging
- Produces sequences (1-7 emails) that feel unmistakably meant for each person

**Automated Campaign Deployment:**
- Automatically adds all qualified contacts with their contextualized sequences to email campaigns
- Maps dynamic content to campaign variables for seamless execution
- Maintains the context chain from qualification through delivery
