  "description": "## ✅ What problem does this workflow solve?\nAutomatically monitor multiple websites every 5 minutes, log downtime, notify your team instantly via multiple channels, and track uptime/downtime in a Google Sheet—without relying on expensive monitoring tools.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ What does this workflow do?\n\n1. Triggers every 5 minutes to monitor website health.\n2. Fetches a list of website URLs from a Google Sheet.\n3. Checks the status of each website one by one.\n4. Sends instant alerts if a website is **down** (Email, Slack, Telegram, Voice Call).\n5. Logs downtime events in Google Sheets.\n6. Tracks when websites are back **up** and updates the log.\n7. Sends recovery notifications when a site is live again (Email, Slack, Telegram).\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup\n\n### 📄 Google Sheets Setup\n- Sheet 1: List of website URLs to monitor.\n- Sheet 2: Log to store uptime/downtime records.\nSample Format: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_VVpkIvpYQigw5q0KmPXUAC2aV2rk1nRQLQZ7YK2KwY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_VVpkIvpYQigw5q0KmPXUAC2aV2rk1nRQLQZ7YK2KwY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### ✉️ Gmail, Slack & Telegram Setup\n- Connect Gmail, Slack, and Telegram to n8n.\n- Configure each service with proper credentials or OAuth.\n\n### 📞 Vapi (Voice Call) Setup\n- Create a Vapi account.\n- Generate an API key.\n- Configure API Parameters (`vapi_api_key`, `assistant_id`, `number`, `phone_number_id`) on VAPI Node.\n- Insert the First Message specified in the Workflow.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it Works\n\n### ⏱ 1. Scheduled Monitoring\nA **Schedule Trigger** runs the workflow every 5 minutes. It reads the list of URLs from the Google Sheet and loops through each one.\n\n### 🌍 2. Website Health Check\nEach website is pinged to check if it’s online.\n\n### 🔴 3. If Website is Down:\n- It verifies if a downtime record already exists.\n- If not, it:\n  - Adds a new row in the Google Sheet with the timestamp.\n  - Sends notifications via:\n    - 📧 **Email**\n    - 💬 **Slack**\n    - 📲 **Telegram**\n    - 📞 **Voice Call via Vapi**\n\n### 🟢 4. If Website is Back Up:\n- It fetches the matching downtime record.\n- Updates the sheet with:\n  - ✅ Uptime timestamp\n  - ⏱ Total downtime duration\n- Sends recovery notifications via:\n  - 📧 **Email**\n  - 💬 **Slack**\n  - 📲 **Telegram**  \n(No phone call is made for uptime.)\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who can use it?\n\nThis is perfect for:\n- 🚀 **Startups**\n- 👨‍💻 **Freelance Developers**\n- 🛠 **SaaS Product Owners**\n- 🖥 **IT/DevOps Teams**\n\nIf you're looking to replace tools like **UptimeRobot**, **Pingdom**, or **StatusCake**, this no-code solution gives you full control, customization, and cost-efficiency.\n\n---\n",
