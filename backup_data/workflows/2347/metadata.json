  "description": "This n8n workflow is a fun way to query and search over your credentials on your n8n instance.\n\n**Good to know**\nYour credentials should remain safe as this workflow does not decrypt or use any decrypted data.\n\n## Example Usage\n* \"Which workflows are using Slack and Google Calendar?\"\n* \"Which workflows have AI in their name but are not using openAI?\"\n\n## How it works\n* Using the n8n API, it fetches all workflow data on the instance. Workflow data contains references to credentials used so this will be extracted.\n* With some necessary reformatting, the workflows and their credentials metadata are stored to a SQLite database.\n* Next, an AI agent is used with a custom SQL tool that reads the SQLite database created in the previous step. \n* The AI agent is instructed to perform SQL queries against our workflow credential table when asked about credentials by the user.\n\n## Requirements\n* You'll need an n8n API key. Please note that only workflows will be scoped to your API key.\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nAdd extra table fields to the SQLite database to answer even more complex queries such as:\n* workflow status to differentiate between active and inactive workflows.",
