### Weekly Summaries and Budget Alerts
## Who’s it for
This workflow is perfect for individuals who want a simple expense tracker without needing a full app. If you already use Telegram daily, this makes it effortless to log purchases, track spending, and stay accountable to your budget.

## How it works / What it does
* Send an expense in Telegram using the format /spent 5 lunch.
* n8n parses the message and appends the entry to Google Sheets.
* Every Sunday at 11:00, the workflow sends a weekly expense summary to Telegram.
* If you exceed your weekly budget (default €100), you’ll instantly get a budget warning alert.
* Optionally, the sheet can be cleared weekly to start fresh.

## How to set up
1. Create a Telegram bot with BotFather, copy the token, and get your Chat ID via getUpdates.
2. Make a copy of the provided Google Sheets template and connect your Google credentials in n8n.
3. Replace &lt;YOUR_CHAT_ID&gt; and &lt;YOUR_SHEET_ID&gt; placeholders in the workflow.
4. Adjust the budget threshold in the “Check Weekly Budget” node if needed.
5. Activate the workflow and test with a sample expense.
