# Create a Daily Digest of Todoist, Gmail, and RSS and Send via Gmail

## Overview
This workflow is designed to automatically generate a daily digest by aggregating information from your Gmail, RSS feeds, and Todoist. The digest summarizes your latest emails, top news headlines, and pending tasks, then sends a beautifully formatted email directly to your inbox. With daily digest automation, you start your day with a concise summary of key information, helping you stay organized and informed.

## Use Case Scenario
Imagine starting your morning with an email that provides a quick snapshot of your day's most important emails, trending news, and task list. Whether you're a busy professional, entrepreneur, or team leader, this workflow takes the hassle out of manually checking multiple platforms. Instead, you receive a curated summary that enables you to prioritize your day effectively. This workflow is ideal for professionals who want to streamline their morning routine and ensure they never miss a critical update.

## Workflow Details
