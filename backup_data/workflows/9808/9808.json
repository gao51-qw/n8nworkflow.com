It listens for new audio files in a Google Drive folder, transcribes them, extracts action items using AI, and sends a formatted list to a designated Slack channel.\n\n## Who’s it for\nThis template is perfect for project managers, teams, and anyone who wants to save time on post-meeting administrative tasks. If you record your meetings and use Google Drive for storage and Slack for team communication, this workflow will streamline your follow-up process and ensure no action item is missed.\n\n## What it does\nThis workflow automates the entire process of turning spoken words from a meeting into actionable tasks for your team.\n\n1.  **Trigger on New Audio:** The workflow starts automatically when you upload a new audio file (e.g., MP3, M4A, WAV) to a specific folder in your Google Drive.\n2.  **Transcribe Audio:** It takes the audio file and uses Google Gemini to generate a full text transcript of the recording.\n3.  **Extract To-Do Items:** The transcript is then passed to another Google Gemini node with a specialized prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to carefully analyze the text and extract all action items.\n4.  **Format Output:** The AI formats the extracted tasks into a clean JSON array. Each task includes a description, the assigned person, a deadline, and its priority.\n5.  **Send to Slack:** Finally, the workflow sends the structured to-do list as a message to your specified Slack channel, making it easy for the whole team to see and act upon.\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Configure Credentials:** Ensure you have configured your credentials for Google Drive, Google Gemini, and Slack in n8n.\n2.  **Set Google Drive Folder:** In the \"Looking for uploading file\" node, select the Google Drive folder you want the workflow to monitor.\n3.  **Set Slack Channel:** In the \"Send a message\" node, choose the correct Slack account and select the channel where you want the to-do list to be posted.\n4.  **Activate Workflow:** Save your changes and activate the workflow using the toggle at the top right.\n5.  **Test It:** Upload a meeting recording to the designated Google Drive folder to see the magic happen!\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- **Change AI Model:** You can easily swap the Google Gemini nodes for other AI models like OpenAI or Anthropic to handle transcription and analysis based on your preference.\n- **Modify the AI Prompt:** Adjust the prompt in the \"Analyze document\" node to change the output format. For example, you could ask for a meeting summary in addition to the to-do list.\n- **Change Notification Service:** Replace the Slack node with another notification service like Discord, Microsoft Teams, or an email node.\n- **Archive Results:** Add a node (e.g., Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable) after the \"Analyze document\" node to save a history of all meeting transcripts and their corresponding action items.",

Your sole responsibility is to analyze the provided meeting transcript and extract all actionable tasks (To-Do items).\n\nYour output MUST be a valid JSON array of objects. Each object in the array represents a single action item and must contain the following keys:\n- \"task_description\": A clear and concise description of the task.\n- \"assigned_to\": The name of the person responsible. If not mentioned, use null.\n- \"deadline\": The due date for the task. If not mentioned, use null. Try to format it as YYYY-MM-DD.\n- \"priority\": The priority of the task (\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"). Infer this from the context. If it's unclear, default to \"Medium\".\n\nCRITICAL RULES:\n- Only output the JSON array. Do not include any explanatory text, introductory sentences, or markdown formatting like ```json.\n- If no action items are found in the transcript, output an empty array: 対象議事録なし.\n- Do not include summaries, discussion points, or any information that is not a specific, actionable task.?\n\n{{ $('Transcribe a recording1').item.json.text }}",
