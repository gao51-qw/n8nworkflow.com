Perfect for recruiters, sales professionals, and anyone building their professional network systematically.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Contact Management**: Store your prospects in a Google Sheet with their LinkedIn profile URLs\n2. **Connection Verification**: Automatically check if you're already connected to avoid duplicate invitations\n3. **Smart Invitations**: Send personalized invitations to new contacts\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Update the Google Sheet with invitation status\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\n- **Google account** with Sheets access\n- **Browserflow account** with available credits ([sign up here](https://browserflow.io/))\n- **n8n instance** (tested on version 1.109.1)\n\n### Step-by-Step Setup\n1. **Prepare Your Contact List**\n   - Download the [Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFKp3wmbV9qp2tpGGsN72zdiC32y8H1nhjdgP885y-U/edit?usp=sharing)\n   - Make a copy to your Google Drive\n   - Extract the Sheet ID from your URL (the string between `/d/` and `/edit`)\n\n2. **Configure Workflow Settings**\n   - Open the `settings` node and enter your Google Sheet ID\n   - Customize your invitation message in the `message` node\n   - Set up your Google Sheets credentials\n   - Configure your Browserflow credentials\n\n3. **Populate Your Data**\n   - Add contacts to your Google Sheet with their LinkedIn profile URLs\n\n4. **Test & Deploy**\n   - Run a test with 1-2 contacts first (update the `Limit` node)\n   - Monitor execution and adjust `Wait` if needed \n\n## Important Considerations\n\n- **Responsible Usage**: This tool mimics human behavior and respects LinkedIn's natural usage patterns. It's designed for quality networking, not mass spamming.\n\n- **Rate Limits**: Stay within LinkedIn's acceptable limits.\n\n- **Account Safety**: Excessive automation can result in LinkedIn restrictions.
