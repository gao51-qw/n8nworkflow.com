It ensures invoices are generated, sent professionally, and updated in Google Sheets with minimal manual work.\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 How It Works\n\n1. **Trigger**\n\n   * Activated manually (`Execute Workflow`) when you want to process invoices.\n\n2. **Fetch Invoices**\n\n   * Reads client invoice data from a **Google Sheet (Client Invoices)**.\n\n3. **Filter Pending Invoices**\n\n   * Passes through only invoices with `Status = Pending`.\n\n4. **Prepare Invoice Data**\n\n   * Collects and formats details:\n\n     * Invoice ID\n     * Client Name & Address\n     * Project Name\n     * Amount (USD)\n     * Invoice Date (today’s date)\n     * Due Date (7 days later)\n\n5. **Loop Over Invoices**\n\n   * Processes each invoice **one by one**.\n\n6. **AI Email Draft**\n\n   * Uses **GPT-4.1-mini** to generate a **polite, professional email**.\n   * Tone: friendly but business-oriented.\n   * Signed as **Upward Engine Team**.\n\n7. **Extract Email Parts**\n\n   * Separates **subject** and **body** from the AI output using an **Information Extractor**.\n\n8. **Generate Invoice PDF**\n\n   * Uses **CraftMyPDF** to create a formatted **invoice PDF** with:\n\n     * Company details (Upward Engine)\n     * Client details\n     * Invoice ID, Date, Due Date\n     * Amount due\n     * Footer message\n\n9. **Send Email to Client**\n\n   * Sends invoice email via **Gmail**, attaching the **PDF invoice**.\n\n10. **Update Invoice Status**\n\n    * Updates **Google Sheets** to mark the invoice as **Completed**.\n    * Saves Invoice ID, Date, Due Date, and updated status.\n\n11. **Loop Continuation**\n\n    * Continues until all pending invoices are processed.\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 Tools & Integrations\n\n* **Google Sheets** → Stores client & invoice data\n* **Filter Node** → Selects only `Pending` invoices\n* **GPT-4.1-mini (OpenAI)** → Generates professional emails\n* **Information Extractor** → Separates subject & body\n* **CraftMyPDF** → Creates PDF invoices\n* **Gmail** → Sends invoice emails with PDF attachments\n\n---\n\n## 🔹 Example Workflow\n\n✅ **Google Sheets:** Invoice marked as `Pending`\n➡️ AI generates email → “Invoice INV-1023 for Web Design Project – Due Sep 5”\n➡️ PDF invoice created & attached\n➡️ Email sent to client with subject + body\n➡️ Status updated in Google Sheet → `Completed`\n\n---\n\n⚡ This agent ensures **zero missed invoices**, **professional client communication**, and **up-to-date tracking** — fully automated for agencies and small businesses.\n\n---",
