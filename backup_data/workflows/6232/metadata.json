  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis template is a hands-on, practical exam designed to test your understanding of the fundamental JSON data types. It's the perfect way to solidify your knowledge after learning the basics.\n\nThink of it as the **\"driver's test\"** that comes after the \"theory lesson\". You'll be given a series of tasks, and the workflow will automatically check your answers, providing instant feedback.\n\nThe test is broken down into six sequential challenges, each focusing on a core data type:\n1.  **String:** Writing text values correctly.\n2.  **Number:** Using integers and decimals.\n3.  **Boolean:** Working with `true` and `false`.\n4.  **Null:** Representing a non-existant value.\n5.  **Array:** Creating ordered lists of data.\n6.  **Object:** Building nested key-value structures.\n\nFor each challenge, you'll modify a `Set` node with the correct JSON syntax. When you execute the workflow, a corresponding `IF` node will validate your input. A green path means you passed and can move to the next challenge. A red path means you need to try again!\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: &lt; 1 minute**\n\nThis workflow is a self-contained test and requires no setup or credentials.\n\n1.  Read the instructions on the main sticky note to understand the goal.\n2.  Start with the first challenge, **\"Test - String\"**. Activate and modify the node according to the instructions on the purple sticky note next to it.\n3.  Click **\"Execute Workflow\"**.\n4.  If the execution path is green, you've passed! You can move on to the next \"Test\" node in the sequence to continue. If the path is red, read the hint in the error message and try again.\n5.  Repeat the process until you reach the final success message.\n\n**Good luck!**",
