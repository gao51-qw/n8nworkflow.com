## How It Works
This solution centralizes communication data from Slack, Microsoft Teams, Gmail, and GitHub into a unified AI-powered analysis and documentation workflow for teams managing distributed knowledge. Manual aggregation across multiple tools is time-consuming and leads to information silos that obscure key decisions and context. By automating secure data collection and normalization, the workflow enables AI models to analyze conversations, extract decisions, action items, and key themes, and convert these insights into continuously updated documentation such as design notes and knowledge base articles. This improves visibility, preserves organizational knowledge, and supports more effective collaboration and decision-making.

* **Connect credentials:** Slack App API, Microsoft Teams credentials, Gmail OAuth, GitHub Personal Access Token, Anthropic API key
