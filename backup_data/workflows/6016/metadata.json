Here’s how you can customize each part of the workflow:\n\n### 🔄 Replace Perplexity AI with Your Preferred AI Search Tool\nIf you don’t have access to Perplexity’s API or prefer another tool, swap it out easily:\n\nClaude AI (Anthropic)\n\nUse Claude for deeper, context-aware responses.\n\nReplace the Perplexity HTTP Request node with an Anthropic-compatible OpenAI node using claude-3-opus or similar via https://api.anthropic.com.\n\nGemini (Google)\n\nUse Vertex AI or Gemini API to generate summaries or travel tips.\n\nCustom Web Scraper + GPT-4\n\nScrape restaurant/event URLs and feed scraped data to GPT for summarization.\n\nExample:\nInstead of Perplexity suggesting restaurant reviews, use Claude to analyze Google Maps reviews and suggest the top 3 things to try.\n\n### 📆 Replace Google Calendar with Another Calendar Provider\nUse a different calendar tool by adjusting your data source:\n\nMicrosoft Outlook Calendar\n\nUse n8n’s Microsoft Graph integration.\n\nRequires Azure App registration and Calendars.Read scope.\n\n\nNotion Calendar (via Notion API)\n\nPull event data from a Notion table that acts like a calendar.\n\nCSV or Google Sheets Input\n\nParse a CSV or Sheet that stores event information and act on that.\n\nExample:\nUse Outlook Calendar to pull events for the day, fetch weather via OpenWeatherMap, and message you on Slack.\n\n### 📲 Replace Telegram with Other Notification Platforms\nYou can notify yourself through your preferred messaging app:\n\n✅ WhatsApp (via Twilio or Ultramsg)\nUse n8n’s HTTP Request node to call Twilio API for WhatsApp.\n\nSend templated messages including time, location, and action items.\n\n✅ Slack\nUse Slack’s Webhook URL or Slack Node in n8n.\n\nGreat for team-wide prep messages or workspace reminders.\n\n✅ Discord\nUse a Discord Webhook to post prep summaries into a private server or DM.\n\n✅ Email\nUse the Email node in n8n to send daily summaries to your inbox.\n\nExample:\nInstead of sending alerts on Telegram, send a beautifully formatted Slack message 30 minutes before a flight.\n\n### 🌐 Enhance with Other External Data Sources\nGo beyond weather and flights:\n\nFlightAware API: For accurate flight status updates, delays, and gate changes\n\nGoogle Maps API: Estimate travel time to event location + suggest departure time\n\nEventbrite or Ticketmaster API: Fetch event entry rules, artist lineup, or parking info\n\nChatGPT Plugins (via Browser automation or 3rd-party wrappers): Fetch contextual insights from anywhere online\n\nExample:\nIf your event is an outdoor concert, fetch artist bios via Ticketmaster, weather updates from OpenWeather, and Uber travel estimates from Google Maps API.\n\n### 🧠 Personalize the AI Prompts for Your Needs\nCustomize the way OpenAI responds:\n\nAdd your name, preferences, or tone of voice in the system prompt\n\nTell it your travel habits, favorite cuisines, or packing preferences\n\nPrompt Example:\n“I’m a vegan traveler with asthma — summarize how I should prepare for this flight from NYC to Delhi and what the AQI is expected to be.”.\n\n## Setup Instructions\nHere are step-by-step setup instructions for integrating each of the requested services in n8n:\n\n## 1.
