This automation finds new postings, uses AI to summarize what clients need, and emails you a clean digest.\n\n**How it works:**  \nRuns on schedule → scrapes the Make.com professional services forum → filters jobs from last 7 days → AI summarizes each posting → sends formatted email digest.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n1. **Freelancers**: Get daily job alerts without forum browsing, respond to opportunities faster\n2. **Agencies**: Keep sales teams informed of potential clients needing Make.com expertise\n3. **Job Seekers**: Track contract and full-time positions requiring Make.com skills\n\n### Detailed Workflow\n\n**Scraping:** HTTP module pulls HTML from the Make.com forum job board\n\n**Parsing:** Extracts job titles, dates, authors, and thread links\n\n**Filtering:** Only jobs posted within last 7 days pass through (configurable)\n\n**AI Processing:** GPT-5-mini analyzes each post to extract:\n- Project type\n- Key requirements\n- Complexity level\n- Budget/timeline (if mentioned)\n\n**Email Generation:** Aggregates summaries into organized HTML email with direct links\n\n**Delivery:** Sends via SMTP to your inbox\n\n### Setup Steps\n\n**Time:** ~10 minutes\n\n**Requirements:**\n- OpenRouter API key ([get one here](https://openrouter.ai/))\n- SMTP credentials (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Import template\n2. Add OpenRouter API key in \"OpenRouter Chat Model\" node\n3. Configure SMTP settings in \"Send email\" node\n4. Update recipient email address\n5. Set schedule (recommended: daily at 8 AM)\n6.
