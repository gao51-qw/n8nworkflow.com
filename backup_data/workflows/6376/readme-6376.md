# Process images with Background Remover AI and track results in Google Sheets

> ### **AI-Powered Image Background Removal Workflow with Google Sheets Integration**

## **Flow Description:**

This workflow utilizes **AI-powered image background removal** integrated with **Google Sheets** to create a fully automated and streamlined process for handling and managing image files. The flow is triggered when a user uploads an image through a form. The image is sent to the API  [**Background Remover AI**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/background-remover-ai3), where it undergoes automatic background removal. Upon successful processing, the new image is uploaded to a temporary file storage service using the [**Temp File Upload**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/temp-file-upload). Afterward, the relevant data, including the image link and status, is logged in a **Google Sheets** document for easy access and tracking.

In case the process fails, the system automatically logs a failure status in the same Google Sheet, along with the reason (if applicable). This allows users to have a transparent, organized, and real-time view of both successful and failed background removal attempts.

### **Used APIs:**
1. [**Background Remover AI**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/background-remover-ai3): An AI-powered service that removes backgrounds from images. This service offers a fast, accurate, and scalable solution for background removal in images.
2. [**Temp File Upload**](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/temp-file-upload): This API facilitates the upload of processed images to a temporary file storage service, making it easy to access and manage files before permanent storage.
