Turn any topic into a ready-to-study Anki deck. This workflow generates vocabulary flashcards with AI images and native pronunciation, then sends the .apkg file straight to your inbox.

**What it does**
1. You fill out a simple form (topic, languages, difficulty)
2. GPT-4 creates vocabulary with translations, readings, and example sentences
3. DALL-E 3 generates a unique image for each word
4. ElevenLabs adds native pronunciation audio (word + example)
5. Everything gets packaged into a real .apkg file
6. The deck lands in your email, ready to import into Anki
7. A backup copy saves to Google Sheets

**Why I built this**
I was spending hours making flashcards by hand for language learning. Finding images, recording audio, formatting everything for Anki... it took forever. This workflow does all of that in about 3 minutes.

**Setup (~15 min)**
1. Install npm packages: `jszip` and `sql.js`
2. Add OpenAI credentials (for GPT-4 + DALL-E)
3. Add ElevenLabs credentials
4. Connect Gmail and Google Sheets via OAuth
5. Update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the DALL-E code node
6. Update the Spreadsheet ID in the Sheets node

**Features**
- 20 languages supported
- 7 image styles (minimal icons, kawaii, realistic, watercolor, pixel art...)
- 6 difficulty levels (A1 to C2)
- Optional reverse cards (target→native AND native→target)
- Works on Anki desktop and mobile
