This template can be used as a real-time listening and processing of search results with [Icypeas](https://www.icypeas.com/). Be sure to have an active account to use this template. 

**How it works**
This workflow can be divided into two steps :
1. A webhook node to link your Icypeas account with your n8n workflow.
2. A set node to retrieve the relevant informations.

**Set up steps**
 You will need a working icypeas account to run the workflow and you will have to paste the production URL provided by the n8n webhook node.
