## How it works  
This workflow automates the complete employee leave approval process from submission to final resolution. Employees submit leave requests through a form, which are summarized professionally using AI and sent for approval via email. The workflow waits for the approver’s response and then either sends an approval confirmation or schedules a clarification discussion automatically. All communication is handled consistently with no manual follow-ups required.

## Step-by-step  
- **Step 1: Capture leave request, generate summary, and request approval**  
  - **On form submission** – Captures employee details, leave dates, reason, and task handover information.  
  - **AI Agent** – Generates a professional, manager-ready summary of the leave request.  
    - **OpenAI Chat Model** – Provides the language model used to generate the summary.  
    - **Structured Output Parser** – Extracts the email subject and HTML body from the AI response.  
  - **Send message and wait for response** – Emails the summary to the approver and pauses the workflow until approval or rejection.  
  - **If** – Routes the workflow based on the approval decision. 

- **Step 2: Notify employee or schedule discussion automatically**   
    - **Approved path**  
      - **Send a message** – Sends an official leave approval email to the employee.  
    - **Clarification or rejection path**  
      - **Booking Agent** – Determines the next business day and finds the first available 10-minute slot.  
        - **OpenAI** – Applies scheduling logic to select the earliest valid slot.  
        - **Get Events** – Fetches existing calendar events to avoid conflicts.  
        - **Check Availability** – Confirms free time within working hours.  
        - **Output Parser** – Extracts the final meeting start time.  
      - **Send a message1** – Emails the employee with the scheduled discussion details.
