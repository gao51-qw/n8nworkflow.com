# Rewrite viral LinkedIn posts in your voice with AI and Telegram approval using Google Gemini

## Who's it for

This workflow is designed for LinkedIn creators, personal brand builders, thought leaders, and content marketers who want to consistently create engaging content without starting from scratch. Perfect for professionals who admire viral posts from others but want to adapt those ideas to their own unique voice and style.

If you're struggling to maintain a consistent posting schedule, looking for content inspiration, or want to repurpose trending ideas while keeping your authentic voice, this automation handles the creative heavy lifting while giving you full control over what gets published.

## How it works

The workflow transforms viral LinkedIn posts into personalized content that matches your writing style, complete with AI-generated images, all controlled through Telegram.

**The process flow:**
1. Send any LinkedIn post URL to your Telegram bot
2. Security check validates your Telegram user ID
3. ConnectSafely.ai scrapes the original post content and engagement metrics
4. Your custom persona profile is loaded (tone, phrases, formatting preferences)
5. Google Gemini AI rewrites the post to match YOUR voice
6. Gemini generates a professional, on-brand image for the post
7. Preview is sent to Telegram for your review
8. Approve or reject with a simple reply
9. On approval, the post goes live on LinkedIn automatically

## Customization

### Persona Customization

The **👤 Load Your Persona** node is where you define your unique voice. Key areas to customize:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `tone` | Overall communication style | "Professional yet approachable, data-driven" |
| `voice` | Perspective and personality | "First-person, authentic, vulnerable" |
| `formatting` | Structure preferences | "Short paragraphs, emoji bullets, line breaks" |
| `hooks` | Opening style | "Start with contrarian takes or personal stories" |
| `expertiseAreas` | Your niche topics | ["SaaS growth", "Leadership", "Remote work"] |
| `commonPhrases` | Signature expressions | ["Here's the truth:", "I learned this the hard way:"] |

### Image Generation

The **📝 Create Image Prompt** node generates the image prompt. Modify the style parameters to match your brand:

- **Current style**: Modern, clean, corporate, vector art
- **Customize**: Change to photography, illustrations, or abstract visuals

### Post Length

In the persona configuration, adjust `postLength`:
- `"short"` - Quick insights (under 500 characters)
- `"medium"` - Standard posts (500-1500 characters)
- `"long"` - Deep dives (1500-3000 characters)

### AI Model Selection

The workflow uses `gemini-2.5-pro` for text. You can switch to other models in the **Google Gemini Chat Model** node based on your needs.
