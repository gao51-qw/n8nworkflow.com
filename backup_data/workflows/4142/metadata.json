  "description": "This workflow creates a powerful AI assistant in Telegram that helps you manage your tasks in Notion. The assistant leverages OpenAI's language models to understand natural language commands, process voice messages, and maintain context through conversations.\n\nKey features:\n- Processes both text and voice messages in Telegram\n- Transcribes voice messages automatically\n- Maintains conversation context with memory\n- Manages Notion tasks through a custom tool:\n  • List all tasks\n  • Add new tasks with priority (today/later)\n  • Complete or uncomplete tasks\n  • Change task timing\n\nThe workflow consists of two main parts:\n1. AI Agent section: Handles Telegram connectivity, message processing, voice transcription, and conversation management\n2. Notion Tool section: Implements the custom tool that connects to your Notion database, allowing the AI to interact with your tasks\n\nSetup requires:\n- A Telegram bot token\n- OpenAI API credentials\n- Notion integration token and database ID\n\n[Example Notion Database](https://minglesai.notion.site/1feb53dccd6a81a1a12aedea55bff6a6?v=1feb53dccd6a81f5880c000c0387b716&pvs=4)\n\n\nPerfect for personal productivity, team task management, or as a foundation for building more complex AI assistants with additional tools.",
