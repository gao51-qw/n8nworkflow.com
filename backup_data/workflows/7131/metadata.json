  "description": "## This n8n workflow promotes your brand/company/platform by mentioning it in Twitter comments. The responses look human-like, the workflow is robust and designed to avoid bans.\n\n#### Good to know\nThe workflow is configured to maximize efficiency while minimizing costs and ensuring your Twitter account won't get banned or shadow-banned. Generating more than 17 comments per day would require a paid Twitter subscription plan.\n\n### How it works\n- The User sets a keyword that would be used to find relevant Posts. An AI Agent analyzes each Post and writes a response, promoting User's Brand.\n- After each reponse is submitted, the result is  logged in a Report Table for tracking and convenience.\n\n### Set up steps\n- Set your target keyword and start the workflow.\n- Detailed instructions and tutorials can be found in the workflow's sticky notes.\n\n### Requirements\n- Twitter and Google accounts.\n- twitterapi.io subscription (used to overcome official Twitter API limitaions).\n- Anthropic subscription (GPT models are also supported, but I personally recommend using Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 for text generation).",
