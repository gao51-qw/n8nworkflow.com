  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the enrichment of a company list by discovering and extracting each company’s official LinkedIn URL using Bright Data’s search capabilities and Google Gemini AI for HTML parsing and result interpretation.\n\n![image.png](fileId:1451)\n\n## Who is this template for?\nThis workflow is ideal for sales, business development, and data research professionals who need to collect official LinkedIn company profiles for multiple organizations, starting from a list of company names in Google Sheets. It’s especially useful for teams who want to automate sourcing LinkedIn URLs, enrich their prospect database, or validate company data at scale.\n\n## How it works\n**Manual Trigger:**\nThe workflow is started manually (useful for controlled batch runs and testing).\n**Read Company Names:**\nCompany names are loaded from a specified Google Sheets table.\n**Loop Over Each Company:**\nEach company is processed one-by-one:\n- A custom Google Search URL is generated for each name.\n- A Bright Data Web Unlocker request is sent to fetch Google search results for “site:linkedin.com [company name]”.\n- Parse LinkedIn Profile URL Using AI:\nGoogle Gemini (or your specified LLM) analyzes the fetched search page and extracts the most likely official LinkedIn company profile.\n\n**Result Handling:**\n- If a profile is found, it’s stored in the results.\n- If not, an empty result is created, but you can add custom logic (notifications, retries, etc.).\n\n**Batch Data Enrichment:**\nAll found company URLs are bundled into a single request for further enrichment from a Bright Data dataset.\n**Export:**\nThe workflow appends the final, structured data for each company to another sheet in your Google Sheets file.\n## Setup instructions\n**1. Replace API Keys:**\nInsert your Bright Data API key in these nodes:\n- Bright Data Web Request - Google Search for Company LinkedIn URL\n- HTTP Request - Post API call to Bright Data\n- Snapshot Progress\n- HTTP Request - Getting data from Bright Data\n\n**2. Connect Google Sheets:**\nSet up your Google Sheets credentials and specify the sheet for reading input and writing output.\n\n**3. Customize Output Structure:**\nAdjust the Python code node (see sticky note in the template) if you want to include additional or fewer fields in your output.\n\n**4. Adjust for Scale or Error Handling:**\n- You can modify the logic for “not found” results (e.g., to notify a Slack channel or retry failed companies).\n\n**5. Run the Workflow:**\nStart manually, monitor the run, and check your Google Sheet for results.\n\n## Customization guidance\n**Change Input/Output Sheets:**\nUpdate the sheet names or columns if your source/target spreadsheet has a different structure.\n\n**Use Another AI Model:**\nReplace the Google Gemini node with another LLM node if preferred.\n\n**Integrate Alerts:**\nAdd Slack or email nodes to notify your team when a LinkedIn profile is not found or when the process is complete.",
