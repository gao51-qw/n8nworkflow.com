  "description": "This workflow automates **image processing using VLM Run**, extracting signed URLs, downloading results, and distributing them via multiple channels (Google Drive & Telegram).\n\n## ✅ Key Features\n\n* Upload image files through a **Form Trigger**.\n* Process images through two VLM Run agents simultaneously:\n\n  * **Segmentation Agent** → extracts objects.\n  * **Detection Agent** → generates bounding boxes.\n* Webhooks capture completed results asynchronously.\n* **Code Node** extracts the full signed URL for secure downloading.\n* Downloaded images are automatically:\n\n  * Uploaded to **Google Drive**\n  * Sent to a **Telegram chat**\n\n## ⚙️ Workflow Flow\n\n1. **User Uploads File** → Form Trigger node\n2. **VLM Run Agents** → Segmentation & Detection agents\n3. **Webhook Nodes** → Receive processed results\n4. **Code Node** → Extract signed URLs\n5. **Download Node** → Retrieve processed images\n6. **Distribution Nodes** → Upload to Google Drive & Telegram\n\n## 📌 Notes\n\n* Ensure **Google Drive OAuth2** credentials have upload permissions.\n* Telegram Bot token and chat ID must be configured correctly.\n* Regex in the Code Node is critical for capturing full signed URLs including query parameters.\n* Workflow allows multi-channel sharing of images automatically.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Community Node Disclaimer\n\n&gt; **This workflow uses VLM Run node**\n\n\n",
