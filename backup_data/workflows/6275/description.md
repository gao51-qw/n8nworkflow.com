### This n8n template helps you automate the process of generating, uploading, and saving SEO-optimized articles as drafts in your Wordpress site using AI agents for both content and visuals.

Use cases are many: 
- **Blog Owners**: Effortlessly keep your Wordpress blog updated with automated, SEO-optimized articles and featured images.
- **Affiliate Marketers**: Rapidly publish keyword-rich Wordpress posts to boost traffic and affiliate earnings without manual writing.
- **Newsrooms & Content Teams**: Instantly draft and upload timely Wordpress articles to stay ahead on trending topics with minimal effort.
- **Agencies**: Automate content creation and publishing across multiple client Wordpress sites, scaling your agency’s output.

## How It Works
- The workflow begins with a manual trigger in n8n.
- The target Wordpress website domain - where the article will be published - is specified using the **Fields – Set Website** node.
- The **Agent – Topic Chooser & Title Generator** uses Google Gemini to randomly select one of your pre-defined website-related topics and requests the model to generate article elements in your specified format. The results are then parsed and routed to the next AI agent.
- The **Agent – Article Generator** (powered by Google Gemini) creates a complete, SEO-optimized article tailored to your settings and the selected topic.
- The workflow then uploads the AI-generated article as a draft post to your Wordpress site.
- Next, the article content is sent to the **OpenAI** to generate a unique, relevant featured image.
- The generated image is uploaded and set as the featured image in the draft post.
- (Optional) Finally, the workflow can notify you via **Telegram** (or any connected messaging app) that the post is ready as a draft on your Wordpress account for further review.


⚠️ **Important Note**: 

In the default prompt setup of the first **Agent – Topic Chooser & Title Generator**, the website domain is set to **Agent Circle**, the industry is **Technology and Artificial Intelligence**, and the **5 available topics** for article generation are: Artificial Intelligence (AI); AI Agents; Automation; Workflow; Prompts). 

To get the best results for your site, please make sure to adjust this part of the prompt to match your own website domain, your industry, and the topics most relevant to your audience.
