## 📘 Description:
This workflow automates end-to-end validation, assessment, and reporting of n8n workflow JSON templates using Google Drive, Azure OpenAI GPT-4o, Gmail, and Slack.
It retrieves workflows from a Drive folder, validates their integrity, analyzes their quality against official n8n Template Publishing Guidelines, generates a structured report, converts it into a formatted .txt file, and archives it with instant notifications sent via Slack and email.
It ensures a fully autonomous review cycle for workflow publishing, complete with error tracking, AI-based evaluations, and automated reporting.

## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)

▶️ When Clicking ‘Execute Workflow’ (Manual Trigger)
 Initiates the validation pipeline manually, allowing users to start the batch evaluation process on demand.

📂 Fetch Workflow Files from Drive
 Retrieves all JSON workflow files from the “n8n json checker” Google Drive folder, including their metadata (ID, name, timestamps).
 Acts as the primary input source for the validation loop.

🔄 Process Files One by One
 Splits the list of files into individual items to ensure controlled, sequential processing.
 Prevents API overload and maintains order during AI evaluation.

⬇️ Download Workflow JSON File
 Fetches each workflow file from Drive using its file ID.
 Ensures a complete, uncorrupted copy before validation begins.

🔍 Validate File Download Success (IF Node)
 Checks if the downloaded file includes a valid id and JSON structure.
 ✅ True Path: Continues to parsing and analysis.
 ❌ False Path: Logs the failed file to a Google Sheet for audit and debugging.

🧾 Parse JSON Workflow Structure
 Converts raw JSON files into object data structures readable by AI.
 Verifies JSON syntax and schema readiness for further evaluation.

🧠 GPT-4o Language Model Configuration
 Initializes Azure OpenAI’s GPT-4o as the reasoning engine for advanced workflow quality analysis.

🗂 Conversation Context Buffer
 Maintains contextual memory across multiple files, enabling GPT-4o to stay consistent across batch validations and apply uniform judgment standards.

🤖 AI-Powered Workflow Quality Analyzer
 Uses GPT-4o to evaluate each workflow against eight defined quality checkpoints:
 1️⃣ JSON Validity
 2️⃣ Documentation Presence
 3️⃣ Security & Credentials
 4️⃣ Node Naming Standards
 5️⃣ Workflow Validity
 6️⃣ Originality & Usefulness
 7️⃣ Industry-Readiness
 8️⃣ Visual Presentation

Produces a structured JSON output summarizing each checkpoint’s result, reason, and overall assessment.

🧩 Format AI Response to JSON Schema
 Normalizes GPT-4o output into a clean JSON schema for easy parsing.
 Ensures consistency across all AI-generated reports.

📝 Generate Human-Readable Report
 Transforms structured JSON results into a formatted plain-text report with headers, dividers, and human-friendly phrasing.
 Provides an executive-style summary of workflow quality.

📋 Convert Report to Text File Format
 Converts the formatted analysis into a .txt file suitable for archival.
 Preserves visual layout and divider styles for readability.

☁️ Archive Validation Report to Drive
 Uploads the finalized text report to the “EOD Updates report” Google Drive folder.
 Automatically names files with a timestamp (e.g., workflow_report_2025-11-03_103020.txt) for easy tracking.

📧 Email Detailed Report to Stakeholders
 Sends an HTML-formatted email summary including report metadata: file name, size, type, created time, and owner.
 Includes “View in Drive” and “Download” buttons for quick access.

💬 Send Validation Summary to Slack
 Notifies internal teams with a Slack message summarizing the workflow’s assessment result, report name, size, and links to Drive resources.
 Ensures real-time transparency for the QA team.

⚠️ Log Failed Downloads to Error Sheet
 Captures download or validation errors in a dedicated Google Sheet.
 Supports quick debugging and failure traceability across runs.

## 🧩 Prerequisites
Google Drive OAuth connection (Techdome Account)
Azure OpenAI GPT-4o credentials
Gmail and Slack API integrations
