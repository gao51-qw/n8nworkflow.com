**How it works**
Create a form for customer feedback, have OpenAI classify the sentiment of the feedback (positive/neutral/negative) and store it in Google sheets!


**Set up steps**
1. Connect Google sheets
2. Connect your OpenAi account (api key + org Id)
3. Create a customer feedback form, use an existing one or use the one below as example. 
All set!
