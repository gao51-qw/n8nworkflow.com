  "description": "# Viral Marketing Reel & Autopost with Sora2 + Blotato\n\nCreate funny, ultra-realistic marketing reels on autopilot using n8n, Sora2, Blotato, and OpenAI.\nThis beginner-friendly template generates a comedic video prompt, creates a 12-second Sora2 video, writes a caption, and auto-posts to Instagram/TikTok — all on a schedule.\n\n🎥 Watch the full step-by-step tutorial:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKZknEzhivo\n\n## What this template does\n\nThis workflow automates an entire short-form content production pipeline:\n\nScheduled Trigger: Runs automatically at your chosen time (e.g., every evening at 7PM).\n\nAI “Video Prompt Agent”: Creates a cinematic, funny, 12-second Sora2 text-to-video prompt designed to promote a product (default: Sally’s Coffee).\n\nInsert Row (Data Table): Logs each generated video prompt for tracking, reuse, or inspiration.\n\nSora2 (via Wavespeed):\n\nSends POST request to generate a video.\n\nWaits 30 seconds.\n\nPolls the prediction endpoint until the video is completed.\n\nBlotato Integration:\n\nUploads the finished video to your connected social account(s).\n\nAutomatically publishes or schedules the post.\n\nCaption Generator:\n\nUses an AI agent to create an Instagram/TikTok-ready caption with relevant hashtags.\n\nThis turns n8n into a hands-free comedic marketing engine that writes, creates, and posts content for you.\n\n## Why it’s useful\n\nCreate daily or weekly marketing reels without filming, editing, or writing scripts.\n\nExperiment with new comedic formats, hooks, and product placements in seconds.\n\nPerfect for small businesses, agencies, creators, and social media managers.\n\nDemonstrates how to combine AI agents + Sora2 + polling + external posting services inside one workflow.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore running this template, configure:\n\nOpenAI API Key (for the prompt agent & caption model)\n\nWavespeed / Sora2 API credentials\n\nBlotato account connected to Instagram/TikTok (for posting)\n\nn8n Data Table (optional, or replace with your own)\n\n⚠️ All credentials must be added manually after import.\nNo real credentials are included in the template.\n\n## How it works\n1. Schedule Trigger\n\nRuns at a fixed time or interval.\n\n2. Video Prompt Agent (LangChain Agent)\n\nGenerates a cinematic, realistic comedic video idea.\n\nBuilt with a detailed system prompt.\n\nEnsures brand integration (e.g., Sally’s Coffee) happens naturally.\n\n3. Insert Row (Data Table)\n\nLogs each generated prompt so future videos can be referenced or reused.\n\n4. Sora2 POST Request\n\nSends the generated prompt to Sora2 via Wavespeed’s /text-to-video endpoint.\n\n5. Wait 30s + GET Sora2 Result\n\nPolls the result until data.status === \"completed\".\n\nContinues looping if still “processing”.\n\n6. Upload Media (Blotato)\n\nUploads the finished video file.\n\n7. Caption Generator\n\nCreates a funny, platform-ready Instagram/TikTok caption with hashtags.\n\n8. Create Post (Blotato)\n\nPublishes (or schedules) the video + caption.\n\nSetup Instructions (Step-by-Step)\n\nImport template into n8n.\n\nOpen Video Prompt Agent → review or customize the brand name, style, humor tone.\n\nAdd your OpenAI API credentials:\n\nFor prompt generation\n\nFor caption generation\n\nAdd your Wavespeed/Sora2 credentials to the POST and GET nodes.\n\nConnect your Blotato credential for uploading and posting.\n\n(Optional) Replace the Data Table ID with your own table.\n\nAdjust the Schedule Trigger time to your desired posting schedule.\n\nRun once manually to confirm:\n\nPrompt is generated\n\nVideo is created\n\nCaption is written\n\nVideo uploads successfully\n\nEnable workflow → your daily/weekly comedic autoposter is live.\n\n## Customization Ideas\n\nChange the brand from Sally’s Coffee to any business, product, or influencer brand.\n\nModify the prompt agent to enforce specific camera styles, settings, or comedic tones.\n\nSwap posting destinations:\nBlotato supports multiple networks—configure IG/TikTok/Facebook/YouTube Shorts.\n\nAdd approval steps:\nInsert a Slack/Telegram “Approve before posting” step.\n\nAdd analytics logging:\nStore video URLs, caption, and AI cost estimate.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSora video stuck in processing: Increase the wait time or add another polling loop.\n\nUpload fails: Ensure media URL exists and Blotato account has posting permissions.\n\nCaption empty: Reconnect OpenAI credential or check model availability.\n\nPosting fails: Confirm your Blotato API key is valid and linked to a connected account.\n\nCategory: Marketing, AI Video, Social Media Automation\n\nDifficulty: Beginner–Intermediate\n\nCore Nodes: LangChain Agent, HTTP Request, Wait, Data Table, Blotato, OpenAI\n\nIncludes: System prompts, polling logic, caption generator, posting workflow",
