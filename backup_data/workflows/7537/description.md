### How it works
This workflow starts whenever a new lead comes in through Typeform (form submission) or Calendly (meeting booking). It captures the lead’s information, standardizes it into a clean format, and checks the email domain. If it’s a business domain, the workflow uses AI to enrich the lead with company details such as industry, headquarters, size, and website. Finally, it merges all the data and automatically saves the enriched contact in HubSpot CRM.

### Step-by-step

**Capture Leads**

- The workflow listens for new form responses in Typeform or new invitees in Calendly.

- Both sources are merged into a single stream of leads.

**Standardize Data**

-  All incoming data is cleaned and formatted into a consistent structure: Name, Email, Phone, Message, and Domain.

**Filter Domains**

- Checks the email domain.

- If it’s a free/public domain (like Gmail or Yahoo), the lead is ignored.

- If it’s a business domain, the workflow continues.

**AI Company Enrichment**

- Sends the domain to an AI Agent (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini).

- AI returns structured company details:

	- 	Company Name

	- 	Industry

	- 	Headquarters (city & country)

	- 	Employee Count

	- 	Website

	- 	LinkedIn Profile

	- 	Short Company Description

**Merge Lead & AI Data**

- Combines the original lead details with the AI-enriched company information.

- Adds metadata like timestamp and workflow ID.

**Save to HubSpot CRM**

- Creates or updates a contact record in HubSpot.

- Maps enriched fields like company name, LinkedIn, website, and description.
