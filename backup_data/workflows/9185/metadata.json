  "description": "This n8n workflow automates the process of creating high-quality, scroll-stopping LinkedIn posts based on live research, AI insight generation, and Google Sheets storage.\n\nInstead of relying on recycled AI tips or boring summaries, this system combines real-time trend discovery via Perplexity, structured idea shaping with GPT-4, and content generation tailored to a bold, human LinkedIn voice. The workflow saves each post idea (with image prompt, tone, and summary) to a Google Sheet, sends you a Telegram alert, and even formats your content for direct publishing.\n\nPerfect for solopreneurs, startup marketers, or anyone who posts regularly on LinkedIn and wants to sound original, not robotic.\n\n## Who’s it for\n- Content creators and solopreneurs building an audience on LinkedIn\n- Startup teams, PMs, and tech marketers looking to scale thought leadership\n- Anyone tired of generic AI-generated posts and craving structured, edgy output\n\n## How it works\n- Daily trigger at 6 AM starts the workflow.\n- Pulls recent post history from Google Sheets to avoid repeated ideas.\n- Perplexity AI scans the web\n- Generates 3 structured post ideas (including tone, hook, visual prompt, and summary).\n- GPT-4 refines each into a bold, human-style LinkedIn post, following detailed brand voice rules.\n- Saves everything to Google Sheets (idea, content, image prompt, post status).\n- Sends a Telegram notification to alert you new ideas are ready.\n\n## How to set up\n- Connect your Perplexity, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Telegram credentials.\n- Point to your preferred Google Sheet and sheet tab for storing post data.\n- Adjust the schedule trigger if you want more or fewer ideas per week.\n- (Optional) Tweak the content style prompt to match your personal tone or niche.\n\n## Requirements\n- Perplexity API account\n- OpenAI API access (GPT-4 or GPT-4-mini)\n- Telegram bot connected to your account\n- Google Sheets document with appropriate column headers\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- Change the research sources or prompt tone (e.g., more tactical, more spicy, more philosophical)\n- Add an image generation tool to turn prompts into visuals for each post\n- Filter or tag ideas based on type (trend, tip, story, etc.)\n- Post automatically via LinkedIn API or Buffer integration",
