  "description": "**How it works**\n- Trigger: Listens for an incoming chat message\n- Copy Assistant: Feeds the message (plus memory) into an OpenAI Chat Model and exposes two “tools”\n\n**Cold Email Writer Tool**\n\n\n**Sales Letter Tool**• \n\nTool execution: Depending on the user’s intent, the appropriate tool generates the copy\n• Save output: Writes the generated email or sales letter into your target document via the Update a document node\n\n**Set up steps**\n- • Configure your OpenAI Chat Model credentials in n8n (no hard-coded keys!)\n- • Add and authenticate the Simple Memory credential (to keep context across messages)\n- • Create Google Docs (or MS Word) credentials for the Update a document node\n- • Ensure your Chat trigger is pointing at your incoming-message endpoint\n- • Mandatory: Drop sticky-note annotations on each tool node explaining where to enter API keys and how to tweak prompts\n\nOnce everything’s wired up, send a test chat message like “Write me a cold email for a fintech startup” and watch the workflow spin up a polished draft in your document.\n\n**How to use**\n\nImport the workflow JSON into n8n.\n\nConfigure your Chat trigger (webhook or form) to receive incoming messages.\n\nSend a chat prompt like:\n\n“Write me a cold email for a B2B SaaS offering.”\n\nThe “Copy Assistant” custom GPT picks the right tool (Cold Email or Sales Letter).\n\nGenerated copy is written directly into your linked Google Doc or Word document.\n\n**Requirements**\nOpenAI API Key (with Chat Completions & Custom GPTs enabled)\n\nCustom Assistant created in your ChatGPT dashboard (Assistant ID pasted into the Chat Model node)\n\nn8n instance (Cloud or self-hosted) with credentials set up for:\n\nSimple Memory (to persist context)\n\nGoogle Docs or Microsoft Word (for document output)\n\n**Customising this workflow**\nTweak system and user prompts inside the Copy Assistant node to fit your brand voice.\n\nSwap in Slack, Teams or email nodes instead of a document writer to deliver copy where you need it.\n\nAdd or remove tools (e.g., “Follow-up Email Writer”) by duplicating the existing tool pattern.\n\nUse sticky-note annotations on every node to explain where to enter API keys, Assistant IDs, or prompt tweaks.",
