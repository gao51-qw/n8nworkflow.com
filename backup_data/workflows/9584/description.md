**DMARC Reporter**
Gmail and Yahoo send DMARC reports as `.zip` or `.gz` xml attachments that can be hard to read.  This workflow unpacks them on a schedule, turns the data into a simple table, and emails you an easy-to-read report.

##### DMARC insights at a glance:
- Confirm that your published policy is correct and consistent.

- Quickly spot unknown or suspicious IPs trying to send as you.
 
- Distinguish between legitimate high-volume senders (e.g. your ESP) and one-off or small-scale abuse.

- Makes it easy to confirm your legitimate servers are authenticating correctly, and to detect spoofed mail that fails DKIM/SPF.
