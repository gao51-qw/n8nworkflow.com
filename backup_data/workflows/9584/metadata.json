  "description": "**DMARC Reporter**\nGmail and Yahoo send DMARC reports as `.zip` or `.gz` xml attachments that can be hard to read.  This workflow unpacks them on a schedule, turns the data into a simple table, and emails you an easy-to-read report.\n\n![DMARC report](https://sensorpro.co/i/dmarc-report.png)\n##### DMARC insights at a glance:\n- Confirm that your published policy is correct and consistent.\n\n- Quickly spot unknown or suspicious IPs trying to send as you.\n \n- Distinguish between legitimate high-volume senders (e.g. your ESP) and one-off or small-scale abuse.\n\n- Makes it easy to confirm your legitimate servers are authenticating correctly, and to detect spoofed mail that fails DKIM/SPF.\n\n##### Who is this For?\n- Email Marketing Team\n- Mailchimp, Sensorpro, Omnisend users \n- Compliance Team\n\n\n##### Customize:\n- Adjust the Gmail node to include other DMARC reporters by changing the search parms.\n- If not using Gmail you can use any of the n8n email nodes.\n- To keep a record, add an Airtable node after the Set node.",
