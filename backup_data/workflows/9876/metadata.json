  "title": "Automated DHL shipment tracking bot for web forms and email inquiries",
  "description": "This n8n template automates responses to customer inquiries about DHL shipment status, handling requests from both web forms and emails.\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Automate Customer Support**: Provide 24/7 instant answers to the common \"Where is my order?\" question without human intervention.\n- **Reduce Support Tickets**: Decrease the volume of repetitive tracking inquiries by providing customers with immediate, self-service information.\n- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Offer a consistent and rapid response across multiple channels (your website and email), allowing customers to use their preferred method of contact.\n\n## Good to know\n\n- **DHL API Key is required**: You'll need to register on the [DHL Developer Portal](https://developer.dhl.com/) to get your API key.\n- This workflow requires **Gmail credentials** (OAuth2) to monitor incoming emails and send replies.\n- The webhook URL must be configured in your website's contact or tracking form to receive submissions.\n\n## How it works\n\n1.  The workflow is initiated by one of two triggers: a **Webhook** (from a website form) or a **Gmail Trigger** (when a new email arrives).\n2.  A **Merge node** combines the data from both triggers into a single, unified flow.\n3.  The \"Extract Tracking Number\" **Code node** intelligently parses the tracking number from either the form data or the email body. It also extracts the customer's name and email address.\n4.  The **HTTP Request node** sends the extracted tracking number to the DHL API to fetch the latest shipment status.\n5.  The \"Format Response Message\" **Code node** takes the API response and composes a user-friendly message for the customer. It also handles cases where tracking information is not found.\n6.  An **If node** checks the original source of the inquiry to determine whether it came from the webhook or email.\n7.  If the request came from the webhook, a **Respond to Webhook node** sends the tracking data back as a JSON response.\n8.  If the request came from an email, the **Gmail node** sends the formatted message as an email reply to the customer.\n\n## How to use\n\n1.  **Configure the Triggers**:\n    - **Webhook Trigger**: Copy the Test URL and set it as the action endpoint for your web form. Once you activate the workflow, use the Production URL.\n      ```\n      Webhook URL: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/dhl-tracking-inquiry\n      ```\n    - **Gmail Trigger**: Connect your Gmail account using OAuth2 credentials and set the desired filter conditions (e.g., unread emails with a specific subject).\n\n2.  **Set up the DHL API**:\n    - Open the \"Get DHL Tracking Status\" (HTTP Request) node and navigate to the \"Headers\" tab.\n    - Replace `YOUR_DHL_API_KEY` with your actual DHL API key.\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"DHL-API-Key\": \"YOUR_DHL_API_KEY\"\n      }\n      ```\n\n3.  **Configure the Gmail Send Node**:\n    - Connect the same Gmail credentials to the \"Send Gmail Response\" node.\n    - Customize options like the `replyTo` address as needed.\n\n4.  **Activate the workflow**.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- A **DHL Developer Portal account** to obtain an API key.\n- A **Gmail account** configured with OAuth2 in n8n.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n- **Add More Carriers**: Duplicate the HTTP Request node and response formatting logic to support other shipping carriers like FedEx or UPS.\n- **Log Inquiries**: Add a node to save inquiry details (tracking number, customer email, status) to a Google Sheet or database for analytics.\n- **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling, such as sending a Slack notification to your support team if the DHL API is down or returns an unexpected error.",
