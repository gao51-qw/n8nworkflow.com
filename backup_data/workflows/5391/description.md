# Smart Invoice Collection System with OpenAI, Gmail & Google Sheets

**Categories:** Financial Automation, AI Business Tools, Cash Flow Management

This workflow creates an intelligent invoice collection system that automatically follows up on overdue invoices using AI-powered personalization. The system monitors your invoice database, analyzes email history to prevent inappropriate follow-ups, and sends increasingly urgent but professional reminders at precise intervals. Built to solve one of the biggest cash flow killers for small businesses, this automation can easily generate an additional $10-15K per year in recovered payments.

## **Benefits**

- **Escalating Urgency** - Four template levels from gentle reminders to firm collection notices
- **Professional Communication** - Maintains business relationships while ensuring payment
- **Zero Manual Work** - Complete automation from overdue detection to email delivery
- **High-Value Service** - Easily sold to clients for $1,500-3,000 per implementation

## **How It Works**

**Invoice Monitoring System:**
- Connects to Google Sheets containing your invoice database with sent dates and client information
- Automatically calculates days overdue using date difference calculations
- Filters invoices to process only those at specific intervals (7, 14, 21, 28 days overdue)
- Runs on schedule (daily recommended) to catch invoices as they become overdue

**Email History Intelligence:**
- Retrieves recent email conversations with each client using Gmail integration
- Analyzes communication patterns to identify recent discussions about invoices
- Prevents sending follow-ups within 72 hours of relevant email conversations
- Aggregates email threads with timestamps for comprehensive context analysis

**AI-Powered Follow-up Generation:**
- Uses OpenAI to analyze conversation history and determine follow-up appropriateness
- Selects appropriate template based on days overdue and escalation schedule
- Generates personalized emails that reference specific client names and invoice details
- Adapts tone from friendly reminders to more urgent payment requests over time

**Professional Email Delivery:**
- Creates properly formatted emails with personalized subject lines and content
- Maintains professional tone while applying appropriate urgency levels
- Includes clear next steps and payment instructions for clients
- Optionally creates drafts for review or sends automatically based on your preference

**Smart Template Escalation:**

- **14 Days:** Professional follow-up with assistance offer ("Here to help if anything's unclear")
- **21 Days:** More direct approach with specific timeline expectations
- **28 Days:** Firm but professional final notice before escalation

## **Required Google Sheets Setup**

- `Status` - Payment status (Pending, Paid, Overdue - optional)

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Create Google Sheet with exact column headers listed above
2. Populate with your outstanding invoice data
3. Connect Google Sheets OAuth credentials in n8n
4. Update the Google Sheets document ID in the "Google Sheets" node
5. Configure Gmail OAuth for email access and sending
6. Set schedule trigger for daily execution (recommended 9 AM business hours)

**Template Customization:**
The system includes 4 pre-written templates that you can customize:
- Modify sender name and signature in the AI prompt
- Adjust urgency levels and escalation timing
- Customize company-specific language and policies
- Add payment links or specific instructions
