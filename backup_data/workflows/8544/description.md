## Optional: Background Image/Video Behind Avatar

- Open SETUP HEYGEN node and set parameter 'has_background_video' to `true`  
- Open SETUP HEYGEN node and replace video URL in parameter 'background_video_url'

## Tips & Tricks
- Perplexity API account must have billing funded  
- HeyGen API requires paid plan  
- Make sure you copied your avatar ID correctly (not the group avatar ID)  
- If your script is long, it takes more time for your video to finish  
- While testing:
  - Enable only 1 social platform and deactivate the rest  
  - Update AI writer prompt to return a 5-second script instead of 30 seconds to reduce processing time
- Go to HeyGen and check that your avatar video is being processed  
- After the workflow finishes, check your social media account for the final post  
- If successful, enable another social media node and continue testing
