Do not output anything else. NEVER include intermediate thoughts, notes, or formatting.\n\n3.

Consider that generative AI tools tend to be more conversational in nature and have a Q&A type format, so search engines will want to pull in snippets that concisely answer a user’s question.\n\n- what is ask engine optimization in the age of AI?\n- How does traditional SEO compare to ask engine optimization today?\n- top tips and tricks to get started with ask engine optimization?\n\n#ai #askengineoptimization #chatgpt #seo\n</example>\n\n4.

Then, install \"Blotato\" verified community node.\n- Create Blotato credential\n- Sign up for Heygen web plan and API plan\n- Paste your Heygen API key\n- Paste your Heygen avatar ID\n- Paste your Heygen voice ID\n- Complete the 2 setup steps in BROWN sticky notes in this template\n- If you want a background image/video behind your avatar: (1) ensure you have an avatar with background removed which requires a higher tier plan; (2) open SETUP HEYGEN node and set parameter 'has_background_video' to `true`; (3) open SETUP HEYGEN node and replace video URL in parameter 'background_video_url'. I only recommend doing this AFTER the full workflow is operational.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n- While testing: enable only 1 social platform, and deactivate the rest for testing purposes. Update the AI agent node’s prompt to return a 5-second script, rather than 30 seconds, to reduce the processing duration.\n- Go to Heygen and check that your avatar video is being processed.\n- After the workflow finishes, check your social media account for the final post.\n- If successful, then enable another social media node, and continue testing."
