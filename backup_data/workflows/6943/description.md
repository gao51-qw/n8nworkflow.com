# Enhance Your Workflow with 2Ndmoises_Generator AI

This n8n workflow integrates with **Replicate’s `moicarmonas/2ndmoises_generator` model** to generate custom outputs based on your prompt. It handles authentication, triggers the prediction, monitors progress, and processes the final result automatically.

---

## 📌 Section 1: Trigger & Authentication

### ⚡ On Clicking ‘Execute’ (Manual Trigger)

* Purpose: Start the workflow manually whenever you want to run it.
* Benefit: Great for testing or running on-demand without needing automation.

### 🔑 Set API Key (Set Node)

* Purpose: Stores your **Replicate API key** in the workflow.
* How it works: Adds your API key as a variable that other nodes can reference.
* Benefit: Keeps credentials secure and reusable.

---

## 📌 Section 2: Sending the AI Request

### 📤 Create Prediction (HTTP Request Node)

* Purpose: Sends a request to the Replicate API to start generating output with the model.
* Input Parameters:

  * **prompt** (text you provide)
  * **seed** (for reproducibility)
  * **width / height / lora\_scale** (generation settings)
* Benefit: Allows full customization of the AI’s generation process.

### 🆔 Extract Prediction ID (Code Node)

* Purpose: Pulls out the **Prediction ID** and **status** from the API response.
* Why important: The ID is required to check the job’s progress later.
* Benefit: Automates polling without manual tracking.

---

## 📌 Section 3: Polling & Waiting

### ⏳ Wait (Wait Node)

* Purpose: Adds a short pause (2 seconds) between checks.
* Benefit: Prevents hitting the API too quickly and avoids errors.

### 🔄 Check Prediction Status (HTTP Request Node)

* Purpose: Calls Replicate again to ask if the prediction is finished.
* Benefit: Automates progress monitoring without manual refresh.

### ✅ Check If Complete (If Node)

* Purpose: Decides whether the model has finished generating.
* Paths:

  * **True** → Move on to processing the result.
  * **False** → Go back to Wait and recheck.
* Benefit: Ensures the workflow loops until a final output is ready.

---

## 📌 Section 4: Handling the Result

### 📦 Process Result (Code Node)

* Purpose: Cleans up the final API response and extracts:

  * Status
  * Output (generated result)
  * Metrics
  * Timestamps (created\_at / completed\_at)
  * Model info
* Benefit: Provides a structured, ready-to-use output for other workflows or integrations.
