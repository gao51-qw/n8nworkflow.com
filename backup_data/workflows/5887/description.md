## Get Alerted When Your Website Is Down – n8n as an Uptime Robot Alternative

![](https://smoothwork.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/8da7235e-e1a6-4912-918d-961afef95a6e.png)

If you manage a website (or client sites), getting notified when your site goes down is critical. But you’ve probably experienced alert fatigue if you’ve ever received a flood of downtime emails for every tiny outage. These short hiccups are common, and most monitoring tools don’t let you filter them out.

Here’s how you can set up **website downtime notifications with n8n** - no extra subscriptions, and no more false positives spamming your inbox. For your most important sites, you can even get direct text alerts to your phone.

We’ll use **n8n**, a powerful automation tool with thousands of templates and integrations. You can run it in the cloud or even self-host it for free.

### Why Use n8n for Website Monitoring?

Uptime Robot and similar services have limitations or get expensive fast if you monitor several sites. n8n gives you full control - you choose when and *how* you get notified, set your own timing and thresholds, and you aren’t stuck with default alert logic.

Plus, n8n can automate much more than just uptime monitoring: use it to handle other business workflows too.

### Quick Start: Free n8n Website Monitoring Template

- Use the template to get started fast.
- Log in or sign up for n8n Cloud, or self-host for free if you prefer.
- Configure your schedule (default: hourly) and list the sites you want to monitor.
- Key setting: **wait seconds**. Recommended: 300 seconds (5 minutes). If your site goes down, the workflow waits before sending an alert—no notification for a 1-2 minute outage, only real, persistent problems.

### How to Test & Use

1. **Activate the workflow.**  
   Toggle it on in n8n and it’ll check your sites automatically.
2. **Test instantly:**  
   Add a non-existent URL and run the workflow. After the wait time, you’ll get an email alert for that URL.
3. **Notifications stay organized:**  
   Alerts go straight to your inbox (see my [AI email labelling template](https://youtu.be/BQARyWMD_lU) if you want color-coded organization).

### Get Critical Alerts on Your Phone (Telegram)

Email is great, but for your most important sites you want instant notifications on your phone.  
**Best option:** Use Telegram. n8n can send you messages via a Telegram bot—easy to set up, free, and works in seconds.

**How:**
- Create a Telegram bot via BotFather (instructions in the template).
- Add your bot token and chat ID to n8n.
- Now, you’ll get downtime alerts right on Telegram—no missed notifications, no extra costs.

### FAQ

- **Can I monitor unlimited sites?**  
  Yes, just list them all in the config.
- **What if downtime is just a few seconds?**  
  The default 5-minute wait filters these out.
- **Do I need a paid n8n plan?**  
  No - self-hosting is free, and the workflow works on free plans.
- **Why not SMS or WhatsApp?**  
  Telegram bots are fastest, easiest, and don’t require extra API setup or subscriptions.
