**++Who’s it for++**

This template is ideal for anyone who needs reliable, real-time visibility into failed executions in n8n. Whether you’re a developer, operator, founder, or part of a small team, this workflow helps you detect issues quickly without digging through execution logs. It’s especially useful for users who want the flexibility to enable AI-powered diagnostics when needed.

**++What it does++**

The workflow sends an automated email alert whenever any workflow in your n8n instance encounters an error. It captures key details such as workflow name, timestamp, node name, and error message. If you enable AI analysis, the alert also includes a Severity Level and a Quick Resolution—giving you an instant, actionable understanding of the problem. If AI is disabled, you receive a clean, minimal error notification.

**2.** Config — Set Fields stores your SMTP settings and the AnalyzeErrorWithAI toggle.
**3.** Use AI Analysis? decides whether to run the AI node.
