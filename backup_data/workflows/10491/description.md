This enterprise-grade **n8n workflow** automates the **Pharmaceutical Raw Material COA Verification & Vendor Quality Scoring System** — from upload to final reporting — using **AI-powered document extraction**, specification matching, and dynamic vendor scoring. It processes Certificates of Analysis (COAs) to validate compliance, assign quality scores, generate approvals or CAPA requests, and notify stakeholders, ensuring regulatory adherence and vendor accountability with full audit trails and zero manual data entry.

## **Key Features**
* **Webhook-triggered COA Upload** for seamless integration with file-sharing systems
* **AI Document Extraction** to parse test results and data from uploaded COAs
* **Automated Specification Analysis** matching against predefined quality standards
* **Weighted Vendor Scoring** based on compliance metrics and historical performance
* **Compliance Decision Engine** with approve/reject branching and CAPA flagging
* **Dynamic Certificate Generation** for approved materials, including digital signatures
* **Vendor Database Synchronization** to update scores and records in real-time
* **Targeted Email Notifications** for QA, production, and executive teams
* **Executive Reporting Dashboard** with summaries, scores, and verification logs
* **Audit-Ready Logging** for all steps, deviations, and decisions

## **Workflow Process**
| Step | Node | Description |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **START: Upload COA** | Webhook trigger receives uploaded COA file for verification process |
| 2 | **EXTRACT: Parse COA** | Extracts test results and data from the COA document using AI parsing |
| 3 | **ANALYZE: Vendor Compliance** | Compares extracted data against specifications and flags deviations |
| 4 | **SCORE: Vendor Quality Rating** | Calculates weighted compliance score based on test results and history |
| 5 | **DECISION: Compliance Route** | Evaluates score/status: Branches to approve (green) or reject (red) path |
| 6 | **APPROVED: Generate Approval Cert** (Approved Path) | Creates digital approval certificate for compliant materials |
| 7 | **Update Vendor Database** | Saves verification record, score, and status to vendor database |
| 8 | **NOTIFY: Email Alert** | Sends detailed notifications to QA/production teams |
| 9 | **REPORT: Final Report** | Generates executive summary with COA scores and verifications |
| 10 | **REJECT: Generate Rejection Report** (Reject Path) | Produces rejection report with deviation details |
| 11 | **Request CAPA** | Initiates Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) process |
| 12 | **PATH REJECTED** | Terminates rejected branch with audit log entry |

## **Setup Instructions**
### 1. Import Workflow
* Open **n8n → Workflows → Import from Clipboard**
* Paste the JSON workflow
### 2. Configure Credentials
| Integration | Details |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **File Storage (e.g., Google Drive/AWS S3)** | API key or OAuth for COA upload handling |
| **AI Extraction (e.g., Claude or OCR Tool)** | API key for document parsing (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) |
| **Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/Airtable)** | Connection string for vendor records and specs |
| **Email (SMTP/Gmail)** | SMTP credentials or OAuth for notifications |
### 3. Update Database/Sheet IDs
Ensure your database or Google Sheets include:
* `VendorDatabase` for scores and history
* `Specifications` for quality standards
### 4. Set Triggers
* **Webhook:** `/coa-verification` (for real-time file uploads)
* **Manual/Scheduled:** For batch processing if needed
### 5. Run a Test
Use **manual execution** to confirm:
* COA extraction and analysis
* Score calculation and branching
* Email notifications and report generation (use sample COA file)

## **Database/Sheets Structure**
### **VendorDatabase**
| vendorId | coaId | score | complianceStatus | lastVerified | deviations | capaRequested |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| VEND-123456 | COA-789012 | 92.5 | Approved | 2025-11-04T14:30:00Z | None | No |
### **Specifications**
| materialType | testParam | specMin | specMax | weight |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|--------------------|---------------|----------|
| API Excipient | Purity (%) | 98.0 | 102.0 | 0.4 |

## **System Requirements**
| Requirement | Version/Access |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **n8n** | v1.50+ (AI and database integrations supported) |
| **AI Parsing API** | `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` or equivalent OCR |
| **Database API** | SQL connection or Google Sheets API |
| **Email API** | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail` or SMTP |
| **File Storage** | AWS S3 or Google Drive API access |

## **Optional Enhancements**
* Integrate **ERP Systems** (e.g., SAP) for direct material release
* Add **Regulatory Export** to PDF/CSV for FDA audits
* Implement **Historical Trend Analysis** for vendor performance dashboards
* Use **Multi-Language Support** for global COA extraction
* Connect **Slack/Teams** for real-time alerts beyond email
* Enable **Batch Processing** for high-volume uploads
* Add **AI Anomaly Detection** for predictive non-compliance flagging
* Build **Custom Scoring Models** via integrated ML tools

**Result:**  
A fully automated quality assurance pipeline that verifies COAs, scores vendors, and drives compliance decisions — **ensuring pharmaceutical safety and efficiency with AI precision and complete traceability.**
