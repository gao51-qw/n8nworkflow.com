🎥 AI-Powered Inbound Video Agent: Auto-Respond to Leads with Personalized Videos
Description: This workflow automates the first-touch response for inbound leads by creating and delivering a hyper-personalized video and follow-up email, all in seconds, using a powerful stack: n8n, Scout, HeyGen API, and OpenAI.

How It Works (The Lead Journey):

📥 Form Trigger: Captures initial user inputs (name, email, address).

🔎 Data Enrichment (Scout): Instantly looks up lead details like property type, homeownership status, and household income.

✍️ Script Agent (GPT-5/LangChain): An AI agent writes a professional, 15-second outreach script, tailoring the message with three discussion paths based on the enriched Scout data.

🎬 Video Generation (HeyGen): Triggers an avatar video using the custom script.

📧 Delivery Logic: Waits for the video to complete, retrieves the final URL/thumbnail, and passes it to the next step.

🔗 Email Writer (GPT-4): Generates an HTML outreach email, embedding the video thumbnail and including a direct booking link (Calendly).

🚀 Send Email (Gmail Node): Sends the complete, personalized message to the inbound lead automatically.
