  "description": "This workflow will allow you to use OpenAI Assistant API together with a chatting platform. This version is configured to work with Hubspot, however, the Hubspot modules can be replaced by other platform and it will work similarly. \n\n## Prerequisites: \n- Create a Hubspot Chat (Live chat available on free plan) or Chatflow (paid hubspot only) and configure it to send all replies toward an n8n webhook (you need to create a custom app for that. I will create a separate article on how to do it, meanwhile, feel free to message me if you need support. \n\n## Setup:\n- Create a OpenAI Assistant, define its functionality and functions\n- Update the Hubspot modules with the Hubspot API Key\n- Update the OpenAI modules with OpenAI API Key\n- Create an Airtable or any other database where you keep a reference between the thread id in Hubspot and Assistant API\n\nIf you need help deploying this solution don't hesitate to email  [me](mailto:tsocaci@makeitfuture.eu/) or schedule a call [here.](https://meetings.hubspot.com/makeitfuture/tiberiu-makeitfuture-xcal) \n\n![CleanShot 20240420 at 16.23.15.png](fileId:789)\n\n\n ",
