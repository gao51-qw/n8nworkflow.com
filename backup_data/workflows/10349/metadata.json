  "description": "## How it Works\nThis workflow transforms natural language queries into research reports through a five-stage AI pipeline. When triggered via webhook (typically from Google Sheets using the companion [`google-apps-script.js`](https://gist.github.com/danishashko/fb509b733aebf5538676ca80b19fa28b) (GitHub gist), it first checks Redis cache for instant results.\n\nFor new queries, GPT-4o breaks complex questions into focused sub-queries, optimizes them for search, then uses Bright Data's MCP Tool to find the top 5 credible sources (official sites, news, financial reports). URLs are scraped in parallel, bypassing bot detection.\n\nGPT-4o extracts structured data from each source: answers, facts, entities, sentiment, quotes, and dates. GPT-4o-mini validates source credibility and filters unreliable content. Valid results aggregate into a final summary with confidence scores, key insights, and extended analysis.\n\nResults cache for 1 hour and output via webhook, Slack, email, and DataTable—all in 30-90 seconds with 60 requests/minute rate limiting.\n\n---\n\n## Who is this for?\n- Research teams needing automated multi-source intelligence\n- Content creators and journalists requiring fact-checked information\n- Due diligence professionals conducting competitive intelligence\n- Google Sheets power users wanting AI research in spreadsheets\n- Teams managing large research volumes needing caching and rate limiting\n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n**Setup time:** 30-45 minutes\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Bright Data account (Web Scraping API + MCP token)\n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini access)\n- Redis instance\n- Slack workspace (optional)\n- SMTP email provider (optional)\n- Google account (optional for Sheets integration)\n\n**Core Setup:**\n1. Get Bright Data Web Scraping API token and MCP token\n2. Get OpenAI API key\n3. Set up Redis instance\n4. Configure critical nodes:\n   - **Webhook Entry:** Add Header Auth token\n   - **Bright Data MCP Tool:** Add MCP endpoint with token\n   - **Parallel Web Scraping:** Add Bright Data API credentials\n   - **Redis Nodes:** Add connection credentials\n   - **All GPT Nodes:** Add OpenAI API key (5 nodes)\n   - **Slack/Email:** Add credentials if using\n\n**Google Sheets Integration:**\n1. Create Google Sheet\n2. Open **Extensions → Apps Script**\n3. **Paste the companion [`google-apps-script.js`](https://gist.github.com/danishashko/fb509b733aebf5538676ca80b19fa28b) code**\n4. Update webhook URL and auth token\n5. Save and authorize\n\n**Test:** `{\"prompt\": \"What is the population of Tokyo?\", \"source\": \"Test\", \"language\": \"English\"}`\n\n---\n\n## Customization Guidance\n- **Source Count:** Change from 5 to 3-10 URLs per query\n- **Cache Duration:** Adjust from 1 hour to 24 hours for stable info\n- **Rate Limits:** Modify 60/minute based on usage needs\n- **Character Limits:** Adjust 400-char main answer to 200-1000\n- **AI Models:** Swap GPT-4o for Claude or use GPT-4o-mini for all stages\n- **Geographic Targeting:** Add more regions beyond us/il\n- **Output Channels:** Add Notion, Airtable, Discord, Teams\n- **Temperature:** Lower (0.1-0.2) for facts, higher (0.4-0.6) for analysis\n\n---\n\nOnce configured, this workflow handles all web research, from fact-checking to complex analysis—delivering validated intelligence in seconds with automatic caching.\n\n---\n\n**Built by Daniel Shashko**  \n[Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shashko/)",
