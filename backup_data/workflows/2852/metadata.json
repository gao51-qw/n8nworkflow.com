  "description": "This workflow is ideal for businesses looking to automate their email responses, especially for handling inquiries about company information. It leverages AI to ensure accurate and professional communication.\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Email Trigger**:\n   - The workflow starts with the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node, which monitors an email inbox for new messages. When a new email arrives, it triggers the workflow.\n\n2. **Email Preprocessing**:\n   - The **Markdown** node converts the email's HTML content into plain text for easier processing by the AI models.\n\n3. **Email Summarization**:\n   - The **Email Summarization Chain** node uses an AI model (DeepSeek R1) to generate a concise summary of the email. The summary is limited to 100 words and is written in Italian.\n\n4. **Email Classification**:\n   - The **Email Classifier** node categorizes the email into predefined categories (e.g., \"Company info request\"). If the email does not fit any category, it is classified as \"other\".\n\n5. **Email Response Generation**:\n   - The **Write email** node uses an AI model (OpenAI) to draft a professional response to the email. The response is based on the email content and is limited to 100 words.\n   - The **Review email** node uses another AI model (DeepSeek) to review and format the drafted response. It ensures the response is professional and formatted in HTML (e.g., using `<br>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<p>` tags where necessary).\n\n6. **Email Sending**:\n   - The **Send Email** node sends the reviewed and formatted response back to the original sender.\n\n7. **Vector Database Integration**:\n   - The **Qdrant Vector Store** node retrieves relevant information from a vector database (Qdrant) to assist in generating accurate responses. This is particularly useful for emails classified as \"Company info request\".\n   - The **Embeddings OpenAI** node generates embeddings for the email content, which are used to query the vector database.\n\n8. **Document Vectorization**:\n   - The workflow includes steps to create and refresh a Qdrant collection (**Create collection** and **Refresh collection** nodes).\n   - Documents from Google Drive are downloaded (**Get folder** and **Download Files** nodes), processed into embeddings (**Embeddings OpenAI1** node), and stored in the Qdrant vector store (**Qdrant Vector Store1** node).\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n1. **Configure Email Trigger**:\n   - Set up the **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node with the appropriate IMAP credentials to monitor the email inbox.\n\n2. **Set Up AI Models**:\n   - Configure the **DeepSeek R1**, **OpenAI**, and **DeepSeek** nodes with the appropriate API credentials for text summarization, response generation, and review.\n\n3. **Set Up Email Classification**:\n   - Define the categories in the **Email Classifier** node (e.g., \"Company info request\", \"Other\").\n   - Ensure the **OpenAI 4-o-mini** node is configured to assist in classification.\n\n4. **Set Up Vector Database**:\n   - Configure the **Qdrant Vector Store** and **Qdrant Vector Store1** nodes with the appropriate Qdrant API credentials and collection details.\n   - Set up the **Embeddings OpenAI** and **Embeddings OpenAI1** nodes to generate embeddings for the email content and documents.\n\n5. **Set Up Document Processing**:\n   - Configure the **Get folder** and **Download Files** nodes to access and download documents from Google Drive.\n   - Use the **Token Splitter** and **Default Data Loader** nodes to process and split the documents into manageable chunks for vectorization.\n\n6. **Set Up Email Sending**:\n   - Configure the **Send Email** node with the appropriate SMTP credentials to send responses.\n\n7. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Trigger the workflow manually using the **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node to ensure all steps execute correctly.\n   - Verify that emails are summarized, classified, and responded to accurately.\n\n8. **Activate the Workflow**:\n   - Once tested, activate the workflow to automate the process of handling incoming emails.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Automated Email Handling**: Automatically processes incoming emails, summarizes them, and generates professional responses.\n- **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses AI to classify emails into relevant categories for targeted responses.\n- **Vector Database Integration**: Retrieves relevant information from a vector database to enhance response accuracy.\n- **Document Vectorization**: Processes and stores documents from Google Drive in a vector database for quick retrieval.\n- **Professional Email Formatting**: Ensures responses are professionally formatted and concise.\n\n---\n\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
