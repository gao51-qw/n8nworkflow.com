Auto-Edit Images from Google Drive with (Wavespeed) Nano Banana and Send via Gmail

When a new image is uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, this workflow sends it to Wavespeed’s Google Nano Banana image editing API, waits for the edited version, and then emails the result automatically. Perfect for creators, marketers, and ops teams who want hands-off, consistent image edits with instant delivery to a stakeholder inbox.
