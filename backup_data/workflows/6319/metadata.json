  "description": "## Automate Amazon searches to Telegram with AI-powered scraping\nThis workflow connects Amazon product lookups to Telegram using AI-enhanced scraping and automation. It lets users send a product name to a Telegram bot and instantly receive pricing, discount, and product links — all pulled dynamically from Amazon.\n\n## Who’s it for\n- Amazon affiliates\n- Telegram shopping groups\n- Product reviewers & resellers\n- Deal-focused communities\n- Anyone wanting fast price checks without browsing\n\n## How it works\n- Telegram Trigger receives messages from the user.\n- AI Classifier (via OpenRouter & LangChain) detects whether the user is asking for a product.\n- If yes, it sends the query to Apify's Amazon Scraper to fetch real product listings.\n- The scraped data (price, discount, rating, link) is formatted into a Telegram response.\n- If not a product query, an AI fallback response is sent instead.\n\n## Requirements\n- Telegram Bot Token\n- Apify API Token\n- OpenRouter API Key (or compatible LLM provider)\n\n\n\n\n",
