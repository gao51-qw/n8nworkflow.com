## Automate Amazon searches to Telegram with AI-powered scraping
This workflow connects Amazon product lookups to Telegram using AI-enhanced scraping and automation. It lets users send a product name to a Telegram bot and instantly receive pricing, discount, and product links — all pulled dynamically from Amazon.

## Who’s it for
- Amazon affiliates
- Telegram shopping groups
- Product reviewers & resellers
- Deal-focused communities
- Anyone wanting fast price checks without browsing

## How it works
- Telegram Trigger receives messages from the user.
- AI Classifier (via OpenRouter & LangChain) detects whether the user is asking for a product.
- If yes, it sends the query to Apify's Amazon Scraper to fetch real product listings.
- The scraped data (price, discount, rating, link) is formatted into a Telegram response.
- If not a product query, an AI fallback response is sent instead.

## Requirements
- Telegram Bot Token
- Apify API Token
- OpenRouter API Key (or compatible LLM provider)
