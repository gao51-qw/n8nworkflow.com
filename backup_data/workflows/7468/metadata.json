It also enables inventory tracking and sets the quantity of an inventory item at your store's default location. \n\nThis is a great way to keep shopify in sync with Airtable if Airtable is your primary source of data, Only records with the 'sync' column set to true are sync'd. Setup Airtable Automations so that if any records are created or updated then this flag is set to true.\n\nRecords are matched using the 'slug' column which Shopify calls a handle.\n \n### Airtable Setup Notes\n\nThe Airtable products table has the following columns\ntitle - free text\ndescription - free text\ncompany - free text\ntype - free text\nstatus - ACTIVE, DRAFT or ARCHIVE\nslug - used in the product url, text with no spaces, can also use hyphen.\nprice - sale price of the products\ncompare_at_price - compare at price for products\nsku - unique code for each product\nstock_on_hand - quantity of this item available for purchase.\nsync - boolean, set to true to sync this record.\n\n### Update GraphQL nodes with your Shopify store URL\n\n1) Replace the URL in all GraphQL nodes with the URL for your Shopify store. \n2) All GraphQL requests all use the Shopify 2025-04 GraphQL Admin API.
