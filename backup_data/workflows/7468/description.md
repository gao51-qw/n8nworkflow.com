## Create Products in Shopify from Airtable

This workflow creates products in your Shopify store from Airtable. It also enables inventory tracking and sets the quantity of an inventory item at your store's default location. 

This is a great way to keep shopify in sync with Airtable if Airtable is your primary source of data, Only records with the 'sync' column set to true are sync'd. Setup Airtable Automations so that if any records are created or updated then this flag is set to true.

Records are matched using the 'slug' column which Shopify calls a handle.
