    "description": "# Sleeper NFL Players Sync \n\nThis template uses the [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.app/) to fetch the complete list of NFL players and stores them in an Airtable base. It’s built to run **daily** and ensures you have the most up-to-date player list for fantasy football workflows \n\n---\n\n## What it Does\n\n- Maintain a current player list for fantasy league automations for Sleeper app users / NFL fantasy football managers\n- Pull Sleeper player IDs once daily instead of every request\n- Build smarter workflows using Airtable as your structured dataset\n- Create a subworkflow in n8n for even more Sleeper app workflows\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Install n8n** (Cloud or self-hosted)\n2. **Import the template JSON**\n3. Create **Airtable Credentials**:\n   - Generate an API key at [airtable.com/account](https://airtable.com/account)\n   - Connect your base and table (you’ll be prompted to do this in n8n)\n   - If you would like to customize how you store data please feel free to use what works best for you\n4. Match your fields with the data you're storing:\n   - `player_id` (text/number)\n   - `full_name`\n   - `position`\n   - `team`\n   - etc.\n\n5. Activate your workflow \n\nRemember, you can customize how you trigger this workflow and where you store the data if you choose to do so.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- Sleeper's player API returns 6,000+ entries, including inactive players, retired players, etc. You can **filter this down** as needed via position, status, or metadata.\n- Airtable record limit on the free tier is 1,000 rows per base — consider upgrading or filtering further.\n- Be careful of rate limits: both Sleeper and Airtable have them (but this workflow stays well within safe boundaries).\n- The Airtable node can be replaced with other data storage nodes (Google Sheets, Excel, etc) if you prefer\n\n---\n\n## Difficulty Rating & Comment (from the author)\n\n- 2 out of 10 if this ain't you're first rodeo, respectfully.\n- If you use Sleeper for fantasy football, lets go win some games!\n\n---\n",

Trying to HTTP the API will cause the request to time out do to the size of the file This workflow will help set you up for more Sleeper workflows for your fantasy leagues by syncing aactive players to a table vs calling on them from Sleeper everytime. \n\nSleeper has players table of every player that ever played but in order to utilize the information for your roster, it needs to be filtered for active players. From there Player_ID fields can give you access to roster information.\n\nAll you'll need is an Airtable (can be used with Supabase,  Google Sheet etc) and the API call. From there, its is converted & filtered for all active NFL players & will update as player activity changes."
