This workflow automatically converts Telegram text or voice messages into Notion tasks by using AI to extract the task name and due date, allowing users to approve or decline tasks directly in Telegram before they are created. It is designed for students managing assignments, professionals tracking tasks from messaging apps, productivity enthusiasts looking to automate task entry, and teams using Notion for organized task management.

## Detailed Use Case

This template turns casual Telegram messages and voice notes into confirmed Notion tasks by handling transcription, AI extraction, validation, and user approval. Typical scenarios include:

- **Students:** Record or type assignment details after class → transcribe, extract title + due date → confirm → save to Notion.  
- **Managers:** Capture meeting action items in chat → extract tasks and deadlines → verify with one tap → add to project database.  
- **Freelancers:** Log client requests by voice → confirm parsed due date → create a tracked task in Notion.  
- **Productivity users / teams:** Quickly funnel ad-hoc requests from Telegram into a single Notion workspace without manual copy/paste.

Key benefits: automated transcription, structured extraction (TaskName + TaskDue), quick user approval in Telegram, and reliable Notion mapping for immediate tracking.
