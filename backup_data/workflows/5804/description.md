**This n8n workflow automatically scrapes the latest posts from a specified Reddit subreddit every day at 9 AM and sends a neatly formatted HTML email summary to your inbox. It highlights new community posts, including post details like title, author, flair, upvotes, comments, and a brief preview — making it ideal for content curators, community managers, or Reddit enthusiasts who want daily updates.**

## How It Works
Trigger: The schedule node runs the workflow once every 24 hours at 9:00 AM.

Reddit Scrape: A request is made to the desired subreddit (defined in the HTTP Request node) to pull post data.

Filter & Format: JavaScript code filters posts created in the last 24 hours and transforms the data into structured summaries.

Email Composition: A dynamic HTML email is generated summarizing the post details. If no new posts are found, a fallback message is displayed.

Email Delivery: Gmail node sends the email with subject, content, and timestamp.

## Use Cases
✅ Stay informed about the latest subreddit activity.

✅ Automate daily newsletters for Reddit topics.

✅ Monitor niche communities for engagement trends.
