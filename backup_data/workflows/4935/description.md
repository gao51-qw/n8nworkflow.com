🔧 How it works

    Input Source: The workflow starts by reading from a connected Google Sheet that contains:

1. SHlink (Shortlink)
2. Amazon Link
3. Description (Optional)
4. PicURL
5. Send /NO or YES

A Send column (used as a flag to check if the row was already posted)

Image Upload: It fetches the product image via HTTP and uploads it directly to a Mastodon instance via the /media API endpoint.

URL Shortening (Shlink): The original Amazon URL is shortened using your self-hosted or cloud-hosted Shlink instance to enable click tracking and better presentation.

Text Generation: A two-line promotional text is automatically generated using a Language Model (LLM), based on the product description.

Posting to Mastodon: The post is then published on Mastodon with:

      1. The image
      2. The generated text
      3. The shortened Shlink URL

Row Update: Once published, the Send column in the Google Sheet is updated to "YES" to prevent duplicates.
