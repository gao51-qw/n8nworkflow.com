**Description:**

This n8n automation template captures real-time order updates from Zoho Ecommerce and instantly sends a customized email alert with customer and order details to your sales or operations team. Ideal for small business owners, D2C brands, or support teams who need to stay updated on incoming orders without manually checking Zoho.

The automation listens for incoming Zoho Sales Order webhook data, parses essential fields like customer name, mobile, product name, total amount, and payment mode, and then dispatches an email summary of the sale for instant follow-up.
