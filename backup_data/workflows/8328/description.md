# Monitor website performance with PageSpeed Insights and save to Google Sheets with alerts

This n8n template automatically monitors website performance using Google's PageSpeed Insights API, compiles detailed reports, and tracks performance trends over time in Google Sheets.

**Use cases:** Agency client monitoring, competitor analysis, performance regression detection, SEO reporting, site migration monitoring, A/B testing performance impact, and maintaining performance SLAs.

## Who's it for
- Digital agencies monitoring client websites
- SEO professionals tracking site performance

- **Core Web Vitals:** Tracks LCP, FID, CLS, and overall performance scores
- **Historical Tracking:** Maintains performance history for trend analysis
- **Alert System:** Sends notifications when performance drops below thresholds
- **Detailed Reporting:** Captures specific recommendations and optimization opportunities

## Two Workflow Paths
1. **Scheduled Audit:** Automatically tests all URLs from Google Sheet on schedule
2. **On-Demand Testing:** Webhook endpoint for immediate single-URL testing

## How to set up

2. Create Google Sheet with columns: URL, Site Name, Category, Alert Threshold, Last_Processed_Date and Device.
3. Set up Google Sheets API credentials
