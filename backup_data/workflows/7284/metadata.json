  "description": "# Automated AWS S3 / Azure / Google to local MinIO Object Backup with Scheduling\n\n## What this workflow does ?\n\nThis workflow performs automated, periodic backups of objects from an AWS S3 bucket, an Azure Container or a Google Storage Space to a MinIO S3 bucket running locally or on a dedicated container/VM/server. It can also work if the MinIO bucket is running on a remote cloud provider's infrastructure; you just need to change the URL and keys.\n\n## Who's this intended for ?\n\nStorage administrators, cloud architects, or DevOps who need a simple and scalable solution for retrieving data from AWS, Azure or GCP.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow uses the official AWS S3 API to list and download objects from a specific bucket, or the Azure BLOB one, then send them to MinIO using their version of the S3 API.  \n\n\n## Requirements\n\nNone, just a source Bucket on your Cloud Storage Provider and a destination one on MinIO. You'll also need to get MinIO running. \n\nYou're using Proxmox VE ? Create a MinIO LXC Container : https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=minio\n\n## Need a Backup from another Cloud Storage Provider ?\n\nNeed automated backup from another Cloud Storage Provider ?\n\n$\\mapsto$ Check out our templates, we've done it with AWS, Azure, and GCP, and we even have a version for FTP/SFTP servers!\n\nFor a dedicated source Cloud Storage Provider, please contact us !\n\n$\\odot$ These workflow can be integrated to bigger ones and modified to best suit your needs ! You can, for example, replace the MinIO node to another S3 Bucket from another Cloud Storage Provider (Backblaze, Wasabi, Scaleway, OVH, ...)\n",
