### About the Automation

Staying on top of competitor pricing changes can be a full-time job. Manual price tracking is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with complex pricing structures and multiple subscription tiers. Paid competitor price monitoring tools like Competera, Visualping and Fluxguard can be expensive. What if you could automate this process and get instant alerts when competitors adjust their pricing?
