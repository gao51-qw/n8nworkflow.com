## Automated Trade Report from Interactive Brokers
This workflow is aimed at traders who use Interactive Brokers. It automatically retrieves the trades made in IBKR on a daily basis and writes them to a Google Sheet, so that anyone can easily perform further analyses and statistics using the on-board tools.

This creates an automatic, continuous trade journal.

### Typical Usecaes
- Monitoring your trades in one journal
- Analyze your Profit & Losses
- Basis for any kind of statistics
	•	Log trades (entry, exit, setup, reason)
	•	Analyze performance (win rate, R/R, expectancy)
	•	Evaluate strategies & setups
	•	Detect mistakes & patterns
	•	Track emotions & discipline
	•	Support coaching, reviews & improvement

### How it works
1. A daily schedule triggers a FlexStatement request to Interactive Brokers to start generating a trade report.
2. The workflow extracts the reference code from IBKR's response, waits for the report to be ready, then downloads the Flex report XML.
3. The XML is parsed and split into individual Trade records.
4. Key fields (tradeDate, symbol, quantity, buySell, tradeID, price, money, currency, fxRateToBase) are normalized.\n5. Each trade is appended or updated in the configured Google Sheet, matching on tradeID to avoid duplicates and keep the journal current.

### Prerequisites
- Trading Account on [IBKR](IBKR)
- Google Sheets OAuth2
- A Google Sheet containing your trading journal
