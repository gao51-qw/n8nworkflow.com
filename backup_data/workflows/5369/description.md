### **How It Works**

This workflow follows a systematic process to deliver automated sentiment analysis:

1.  **Scheduled Trigger:** The workflow begins each day at a specified time.
2.  **Fetch Stock Tickers:** It reads a list of stock tickers from your designated Google Sheet.
3.  **Loop and Fetch News:** For each ticker, it retrieves the latest news articles using the EODHD API.
4.  **AI Sentiment Analysis:** The collected news articles are then passed to a Google Gemini-powered AI agent. The agent is prompted to act as a stock sentiment analyzer, evaluating the news and generating:
      * A **sentiment score** from -1 (strong negative) to 1 (strong positive).
      * A detailed **rationale** explaining the basis for the score.
5.  **Data Formatting & Validation:** The AI's output is parsed and validated to ensure it is in the correct JSON format.
6.  **Log to Google Sheets:** The final sentiment score and rationale are appended to your Google Sheet, alongside the corresponding stock ticker and the current date.
