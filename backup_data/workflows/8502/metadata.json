  "description": "## Overview\n\nHealthcare organizations face significant challenges in digitizing and processing medical records while maintaining strict HIPAA compliance. This workflow provides a secure, automated solution for extracting clinical data from various medical documents including discharge summaries, lab reports, clinical notes, prescription records, and scanned medical images (JPG, PNG).\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n- Extract clinical data from medical documents while maintaining HIPAA compliance\n- Process handwritten notes and scanned medical images with OCR\n- Automatically identify and protect PHI (Protected Health Information)\n- Generate structured data from various medical document formats\n- Maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance\n\n## Who It's For\n\nHealthcare providers, medical billing companies, clinical research organizations, health information exchanges, and medical practice administrators who need to digitize and extract data from medical records while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n\n## The Problem It Solves\n\nManual medical record processing is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates compliance risks. Healthcare organizations struggle to extract structured data from handwritten notes, scanned documents, and various medical forms while protecting PHI. This template automates the extraction process while maintaining the highest security standards for Protected Health Information.\n\n**Setup Instructions:**\n1. Configure Google Drive credentials with proper medical record access controls\n2. Install the PDF Vector community node from the n8n marketplace\n3. Configure PDF Vector API credentials with HIPAA-compliant settings\n4. Set up secure database storage with encryption at rest\n5. Define PHI handling rules and extraction parameters\n6. Configure audit logging for regulatory compliance\n7. Set up integration with your Electronic Health Record (EHR) system\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Secure retrieval of medical documents from Google Drive\n- HIPAA-compliant processing with automatic PHI masking\n- OCR support for handwritten notes and scanned medical images\n- Automatic extraction of diagnoses with ICD-10 code validation\n- Medication list processing with dosage and frequency information\n- Lab results extraction with reference ranges and flagging\n- Vital signs capture and normalization\n- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance\n- Integration-ready format for EHR systems\n\n**Customization Options:**\n- Define institution-specific medical terminology and abbreviations\n- Configure automated alerts for critical lab values or abnormal results\n- Set up custom extraction fields for specialized medical forms\n- Implement medication interaction warnings and contraindication checks\n- Add support for multiple languages and international medical coding systems\n- Configure integration with specific EHR platforms (Epic, Cerner, etc.)\n- Set up automated quality assurance checks and validation rules\n\n**Implementation Details:**\nThe workflow uses advanced AI with medical domain knowledge to understand clinical terminology and extract relevant information while automatically identifying and protecting PHI. It processes various document formats including handwritten prescriptions, lab reports, discharge summaries, and clinical notes. The system maintains strict security protocols with encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring full HIPAA compliance throughout the processing pipeline.\n\n**Note:** This workflow uses the PDF Vector community node. Make sure to install it from the n8n community nodes collection before using this template.",
