  "description": "# 🎯 Self-Learning X Content Engine (Creator RAG Booster)\n\nLearn your voice. Generate posts that sound *like you* — not AI.\n\n## 🧩 Overview\nThis n8n workflow builds a **personal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system for creators.  \nIt learns from your own past posts and generates new tweets, replies, and image prompts in your tone.\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\n\n**Step 1 — Ingest**\n- Use the “Add to KB” Form to upload your past posts or notes.\n- Text + metadata (topic, style) are stored in **Supabase** as vectors.\n\n**Step 2 — Generate**\n- Use the “Generate Posts” Form to create new post ideas.\n- The Agent fetches the most relevant style snippets (via Supabase VectorStore)\n- Output includes:  \n  - 📝 `post`  \n  - 💬 `quote`  \n  - 💭 `reply`  \n  - 🎨 `image_prompt`\n\n## 🔧 Setup (3–5 min)\n1. Connect **Supabase** (URL + Key)  \n   - Make sure the table name is `documents`  \n   - Enable vector extension (`pgvector`)  \n2. Connect **OpenAI API Key**  \n3. Activate both **Forms** and open the URLs to test.  \n4. Optionally replace Forms with Webhooks.\n\n💡 Tip: RLS enabled? Ensure your API key allows **insert/select** for `documents`.\n\n## 🧠 Tech Stack\n- n8n (self-hosted)\n- Supabase (Vector Store)\n- OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini)\n- HTML-based completion form\n\n## 🪄 Credits\nBuilt by [Yusuke | @yskautomation](https://x.com/yskautomation)  \nLicense: MIT[View on GitHub](https://github.com/yskmtb0714/n8n-workflows/blob/main/creator-rag-booster.json)",
