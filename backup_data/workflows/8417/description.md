## Who's it for
This template is perfect for sales teams, marketing professionals, recruiters, and business development specialists who need to efficiently collect targeted lead data from multiple sources. Whether you're building prospect lists, conducting market research, or expanding your contact database, this automated solution saves hours of manual data collection.

## How it works
The workflow uses an n8n built-in form to collect search parameters, then automatically scrapes targeted leads from Google Maps and/or LinkedIn within Apify Actors based on your criteria. All collected data is cleaned, structured using Edit field nodes, and stored in your Supabase database for easy access and analysis.

## Key features:
- Interactive form for easy lead targeting
- Dual-source scraping (Google Maps + LinkedIn), you choose one or Both.
- Automatic data collection and cleaning, and structuring from Apify actors.
- Direct database storage in Supabase
- Flexible result limits and location targeting.

## How to set up

**Step 1: Set Up Apify Account**
Create account at apify.com
Navigate to Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; API tokens
Create new API token and copy it
Ensure you have access to these actors:

LinkedIn Profile Search Scraper (harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search)
Google Maps Scraper (compass/crawler-google-places)

**Step 2: Configure Supabase Database**
Create new project at supabase.com
Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
Run the SQL scripts from the Requirements section to create tables
Navigate to Settings &gt; API to copy:

Project URL (starts with https://...)
Service role key (secret key, not anon public)

**Step 3: Import and Configure Workflow**
Download the workflow JSON file
In n8n Cloud, go to Workflows &gt; Import from File
Select the downloaded JSON file
Configure credentials by clicking on each node that shows a warning:

**For Apify nodes (linkedin_dataset & googlemaps_dataset):**
Click "Create New Credential"
Name: "Apify account"
API Token: [Paste your Apify token from Step 1]
Save credential

For Supabase nodes (save_linkedin & save_googlemaps):

Click "Create New Credential"
Name: "Supabase account"
Host: [Your Supabase project URL from Step 2]
Service Role Secret: [Your service role key from Step 2]
Save credential

**Step 4: Test the Workflow**
Click on the "On form submission" node
Copy the Production URL (webhook link)
Open this URL in a new browser tab
Fill out the test form:

Title/Industry: "restaurants"
Location: "San Francisco, CA"
Source: "Google Maps"
Number of results: "3"


Click Submit and wait for processing
Check your Supabase tables to verify data was saved

Step 5: Verify Setup Success

In Supabase, go to Table Editor
Check the googlemaps table for new entries
Verify all fields are populated correctly
Test with LinkedIn source to confirm both paths work

The workflow is designed to be plug-and-play once credentials are configured. Simply share the form URL with your team or bookmark it for regular lead generation tasks.
