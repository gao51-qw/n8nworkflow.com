## 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual research processes are time-consuming, inconsistent, and often miss critical information from multiple sources. This template solves the challenge of automating comprehensive research across web, news, and academic sources while providing AI-powered analysis and actionable insights.

## 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically conducts deep research on any topic using AI-powered web scraping, collects data from multiple source types, and provides comprehensive analysis with actionable insights.

### Key Components

1. **Webhook Trigger** - Receives research requests and initiates the automated research process
2. **Research Configuration Processor** - Validates and processes research parameters, generates search queries
3. **Multi-Source AI Scraping** - Uses ScrapeGraphAI to collect data from web, news, and academic sources
4. **Data Processing Engine** - Combines and structures data from all sources for analysis
5. **AI Research Analyst** - Uses GPT-4 to provide comprehensive analysis and insights
6. **Data Storage** - Stores all research findings in Google Sheets for historical tracking
7. **Response System** - Returns structured research results via webhook response

## 📊 Google Sheets Column Specifications

The template creates the following columns in your Google Sheets:

| Column | Data Type | Description | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **sessionId** | String | Unique research session identifier | "research_1703123456789" |
| **query** | String | Research query that was executed | "artificial intelligence trends" |
| **timestamp** | DateTime | When the research was conducted | "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z" |
| **analysis** | Text | AI-generated comprehensive analysis | "Executive Summary: AI trends show..." |
| **totalSources** | Number | Total number of sources analyzed | 15 |
