  "description": "## Who is this for?\nThis workflow is ideal for **filmmakers, video producers, content creators, and location managers** who need to quickly build a database of potential shooting locations without manual research and data entry.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Chat Input**: Start the workflow via the n8n chat interface and enter a search query (e.g., \"Quiet cafes in Kyoto\" or \"Cyberpunk streets\").\n2. **Search**: The workflow queries the **Google Maps Places API** to find matching real-world locations.\n3. **AI Analysis**: An AI agent (via OpenRouter) reviews the location details and writes a short, creative \"Director's Commentary\" highlighting its cinematic appeal.\n4. **Data Entry**: The location name, address, rating, Google Maps link, and the AI's commentary are automatically saved to a **Google Sheet**.\n5. **Notification**: Once all locations are processed, a summary link is sent to your **Slack** channel.\n\n## Prerequisites\n*   **n8n Version**: 1.0 or later\n*   **Google Cloud Platform**: API Key with \"Places API (New)\" enabled.\n*   **Google Sheets**: A formatted sheet (see setup below).\n*   **Slack**: An App/Bot token with chat writing permissions.\n*   **OpenRouter** (or OpenAI/Anthropic): API Key for the LLM.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Google Sheet**: Create a new sheet with the following headers in the first row:\n    *   `場所名` (Name)\n    *   `住所` (Address)\n    *   `評価(星)` (Rating)\n    *   `AI監督のコメント` (AI Comment)\n    *   `GoogleMapリンク` (Link)\n2. **Credentials**: Configure your credentials for Google Maps, Google Sheets, Slack, and OpenRouter within n8n.\n3. **Configuration Node**: Open the node named **\"Workflow Configuration\"** and input your specific details:\n    *   `googleMapsApiKey`: Your Google Cloud API key.\n    *   `slackChannelId`: The Channel ID where you want notifications (e.g., C0123456).\n    *   `googleSheetId`: The string of characters found in your Google Sheet URL.\n\n## Customization\n*   **Adjust Results**: Change the **Limit** node settings to process more locations per run (default is set to 2 to save API credits during testing).\n*   **Change Persona**: Edit the \"System Prompt\" in the **AI Location Analyzer** node to change the AI's tone (e.g., from \"Film Director\" to \"Real Estate Agent\" or \"Travel Blogger\").\n*   **Swap LLM**: You can easily replace the OpenRouter node with an OpenAI or Anthropic node if you prefer a different model.",
