# LinkedIn Profile Enrichment Automation

**Who is this for?**
This template is perfect for sales teams, recruiters, marketing professionals, and business development specialists who need to gather comprehensive LinkedIn profile data at scale. Ideal for lead generation teams building prospect databases, recruiters sourcing candidate information, sales professionals researching prospects, and marketing teams creating targeted outreach campaigns.

**What problem does this workflow solve?**
Manually collecting detailed information from LinkedIn profiles is incredibly time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Visiting each profile individually to extract names, job titles, experience, education, skills, and contact details can take hours for even small prospect lists. This automation eliminates the tedious manual data entry while ensuring consistent, comprehensive profile enrichment.

**What this workflow does**
This workflow automatically enriches a list of LinkedIn profile URLs by extracting comprehensive professional data including:
* **Personal details** (first name, last name, headline, location)
* **Professional status** (hiring status, open to work indicators)
* **Network metrics** (connections, followers count)
* **Work experience** (up to 5 most recent positions with company details, dates, and roles)
* **Education background** (up to 3 educational institutions with degrees and dates)
* **Skills and languages** (complete skill sets and language proficiencies)
* **Professional summary** (profile description and bio)

The enriched data is automatically organized and updated in your Google Sheets database with structured formatting for easy analysis and outreach.
