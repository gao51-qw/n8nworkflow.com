# 📄 Post New Articles from Feeds to Slack Channel

## 🧠 What This Workflow Does

This workflow automates the discovery and sharing of fresh articles from a curated list of RSS feeds. It performs the following steps:

1. **Reads a list of RSS feed URLs** from a Google Sheet (`Feeds` tab).
2. **Fetches the latest articles** from each feed.
3. **Checks for duplicates** against previously published links stored in another sheet (`Posted Articles` tab).
4. **Filters out already shared articles**.
5. **Posts the new articles** to a designated Slack channel with formatted titles and links.
6. **Logs the newly shared articles** back into the Google Sheet to prevent duplicates.
