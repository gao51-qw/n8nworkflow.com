This workflow automatically fetches newly uploaded files from a specific folder in Google Drive, shares them via email with specified recipients, and logs the file details (name, ID, created time, modified time) into Airtable for easy tracking. It streamlines the process of file sharing and management while keeping track of important metadata in a central place.
