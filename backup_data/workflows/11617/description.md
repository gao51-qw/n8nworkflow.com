## Who this workflow is for

This workflow is designed for content creators, marketing teams, and automation builders who want to produce short-form video content at scale without manual editing.

It is especially useful for teams posting consistently to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok who want a repeatable, automated content pipeline driven by AI.

## What this workflow does

This n8n automation converts a single Telegram message into a fully generated short-form video using AI.

When a message is sent to a Telegram bot, the workflow:
- Generates a structured short-form video script using Gemini
- Creates multiple cinematic video clips using VEO
- Merges clips into a single short video
- Generates a title, description, and hashtags optimized for short-form platforms
- Delivers the finished video asset and metadata back to Telegram or storage

The entire process runs automatically without requiring manual scripting, editing, or clip assembly.

3. Video clips are generated for each script segment using VEO
