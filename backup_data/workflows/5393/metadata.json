  "description": "## 📽️ What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow turns a user-submitted form with country or animal names into a cinematic video with animated scenes and immersive ambient audio. Using GPT-4 for prompt generation, Dumpling AI for visual creation,& Replicate for motion animation, ElevenLabs for sound generation, and Creatomate for video stitching, it fully automates video production — from raw idea to rendered file.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What problem is this solving?\n\nCreating engaging multimedia content can take hours. This workflow automates the entire process of ideation, design, and rendering of high-quality cinematic clips, eliminating the need for manual video editing or audio production.\n\n---\n\n## 👥 Who is this for?\n\n- Content creators and educators  \n- Digital artists and storytellers  \n- Marketers or YouTubers creating short-form visual content  \n- No-code/AI automation enthusiasts  \n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n### ✅ Step 1: Google Sheet  \nCreate a Google Sheet with two columns:\n- `Title`  \n- `Generated videos`  \nUpdate the Sheet ID and tab name in the final node.\n\n### ✅ Step 2: Google Drive  \nCreate two folders:\n- One for **ambient audio tracks**  \n- One for **final generated videos**  \nUpdate the folder IDs in both Google Drive nodes.\n\n### ✅ Step 3: Credentials Setup  \nMake sure all your API tokens are saved as **credentials** in n8n.  \nThis workflow uses the following integrations:\n\n- OpenAI (GPT-4)  \n- Dumpling AI (via HTTP header)  \n- Replicate.com \n- ElevenLabs  \n- Google Drive  \n- Google Sheets  \n- Creatomate  \n\n### ✅ Step 4: Form Fields  \nEnsure your trigger form includes these fields:\n- `Title`  \n- `Country 1`, `Country 2`, `Country 3`, `Country 4`  \n- `Style` (e.g., cinematic, epic, fantasy, noir, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 How it works\n\n1. **User Form Submission**  \n   Kicks off the workflow with the required inputs.\n\n2. **Format Inputs**  \n   Combines all 4 countries/animals into a single array.\n\n3. **GPT-4: Generate Visual Prompts**  \n   Uses GPT-4 to create rich cinematic descriptions per animal/country.\n\n4. **Dumpling AI: Create Images**  \n   Each description becomes a high-quality visual.\n\n5. **GPT-4: Create Motion Prompts**  \n   Each image prompt is rewritten into motion-based video prompts.\n\n6. **Replicate: Animate**  \n   Prompts and images are sent to Replicate’s model for animation.\n\n7. **GPT-4: Generate Sound Prompt**  \n   Based on the style, GPT-4 creates an ambient sound idea.\n\n8. **ElevenLabs: Create Ambient Audio**  \n   Audio is generated and uploaded to Google Drive.\n\n9. **Creatomate: Stitch All Media**  \n   All 4 motion videos and the audio track are stitched into one cinematic output.\n\n10. **Upload to Google Drive + Log to Sheet**  \n    Final video is saved in Drive and logged in Sheets with its title and link.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to Customize\n\n- 🎨 Modify GPT prompts for different themes (e.g., horror, fantasy, sci-fi).  \n- 🧠 Swap animals for characters, objects, or locations.  \n- 🎧 Replace ambient sound with ElevenLabs voiceovers or music.  \n- 📂 Add metadata logging (generation time, duration, tags).  \n- 🧪 Try using alternative video tools like Pika Labs or Runway ML.\n\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- n8n self-hosted or cloud instance  \n- Active accounts for: OpenAI, Dumpling AI, Replicate, ElevenLabs, Creatomate  \n- Google credentials set up for Drive + Sheets  \n\n---\n\nThis is a perfect end-to-end automation that showcases the power of AI + automation for video storytelling.\n\n",
