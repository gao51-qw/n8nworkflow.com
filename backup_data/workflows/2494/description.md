- You need historical data to identify seasonal trends in keyword popularity
- You want to assess keyword difficulty to prioritize your content strategy

## What this Workflow Does
The workflow connects to Google's Keyword Planner API to retrieve keyword metrics for your SEO research:

- Calculates keyword difficulty scores
- Delivers competition metrics from Google Ads


## Setup

2. Create a Google Ads API account and add credentials to `Get Search Data` node
3. Replace the `Connect to your own database` with your own database for the output


## How to Adjust it to Your Needs
- Change the `Set 20 Keywords` node input to a source of your choosing e.g. Airtable database with 20 keywords
- Connect to output source of your choosing
