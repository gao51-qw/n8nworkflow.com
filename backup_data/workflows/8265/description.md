## Who's it for
Content creators, trainers, and educators who need to convert lengthy documents into digestible micro-learning experiences.

## How it works
This workflow takes your source content (PDFs, articles, handbooks) and uses GPT-4 to intelligently break it into 2-3 minute learning modules. Each module includes a key concept, explanation, practical example, and knowledge check question.

## How to set up
1. Configure OpenAI credentials with GPT-4 access
2. Connect Slack workspace (optional)
3. Set up Google Docs integration
4. Optionally, Send content via webhook or paste directly

## Requirements
- OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access
- Google Docs account (for document creation)
- Slack workspace (optional, for notifications)

## How to customize the workflow
- Adjust module count and length in AI prompts
- Modify output formats (email, mobile, Slack)
- Change document structure and styling
- Add custom delivery channels

Perfect for converting employee handbooks, training materials, and documentation into engaging micro-learning courses that people actually complete.
