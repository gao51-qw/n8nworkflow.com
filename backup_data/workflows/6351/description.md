📝 Automation: Instantly Onboard New Clients from Tally Form to Notion, Google Drive & Slack
This automation streamlines the client onboarding process by integrating Tally, Notion, Google Drive, and Slack. When a potential client submits a Tally form, the automation is triggered via a webhook, automatically handling all onboarding steps without manual intervention.

A new Tally form submission is received via a webhook.

Client Data Extraction

-Name

-Email

-Project Type

-Budget

Google Drive Folder Creation
A dedicated Google Drive folder is generated using the client’s name and project type for storing onboarding assets.

Notion Database Entry Creation
A new item is added to a specified Notion database, storing:

Project scope

Folder link

Slack Team Notification
A Slack message is sent to your designated team channel containing all onboarding details, ensuring the team is informed instantly.
