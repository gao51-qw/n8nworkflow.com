# Automated B2B lead management and AI outreach

> This workflow is a comprehensive, production-grade automation for B2B lead management and multichannel outreach, designed for Sales Development Representatives (SDRs), growth teams, and sales operations. It covers the entire SDR pipeline: from lead ingestion and validation, through enrichment, scoring, AI-powered outreach, reply handling, analytics, and reporting.

**Key Features:**
- Lead validation (email, suppression, geo/GDPR)
- Multi-source data enrichment
- Lead scoring and tiering (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- AI-generated personalized cold emails (with A/B subject testing)
- Multichannel outreach (Email, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) with rate limiting and compliance
- AI-based reply simulation and intent classification
- Automated routing (qualification, follow-up, manual review)
- Full event logging to database
- Aggregated analytics and daily reporting
- Human-readable AI summary and Slack notifications

---

## What This Workflow Does

### 1. Lead Ingestion & Validation
- Loads leads from a source (test data, CRM, webhook, etc.)
- Validates email format and checks against suppression lists (blocked domains/emails)
- Applies geo and GDPR compliance logic (blocks/flags leads from restricted countries)

### 2. Data Enrichment
- Enriches each lead via one or more external APIs (company info, tech stack, revenue, etc.)
- Handles enrichment failures gracefully and logs them for analytics

### 3. Lead Scoring & Segmentation
- Scores leads based on industry, country, company size, revenue, and pain points
- Segments leads into HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW tiers for tailored outreach

### 4. AI-Powered Outreach Generation
- Uses OpenAI (or compatible LLM) to generate personalized cold email content
- Creates A/B tested subject lines for each email
- Generates LinkedIn and WhatsApp message variants for multichannel outreach

### 5. Multichannel Outreach Execution
- Sends emails via SMTP (with rate limiting and quiet hours)
- Simulates LinkedIn and WhatsApp sends (can be replaced with real integrations)
- Logs all outreach events to a Postgres database

### 6. Reply Simulation & AI Classification
- Simulates a variety of lead replies (interested, not interested, follow-up, unclear)
- Uses AI to classify reply intent and suggest next actions

### 7. Automated Routing & Follow-up
- Routes leads based on AI classification:
  - **Interested:** Schedules meeting, logs qualification, proposes follow-up
  - **Follow-up Later:** Schedules future follow-up
  - **Not Interested:** Marks as closed/lost
  - **Unclear:** Flags for manual review and notifies team via Slack

### 8. Event Logging & Analytics
- Logs every significant event (enrichment, outreach, reply, status change) to a database
- Aggregates results by lead score, channel, and status
- Calculates key metrics (qualification rate, enrichment success, multichannel rate, etc.)

### 9. Reporting & Team Notification
- Generates a daily analytics row and stores it in the database
- Uses AI to create a human-readable summary of the run
- Posts a detailed summary to a Slack channel

## Use Cases

- **Automated SDR Workflows:** Replace manual lead research, outreach, and follow-up with a fully automated, auditable process.
- **Growth Experiments:** Run A/B tests on messaging, subject lines, and channels at scale.
- **Sales Analytics:** Get transparent, granular reporting on every step of the SDR funnel.
- **Compliance-First Outreach:** Ensure all outreach respects geo, GDPR, and suppression rules.
- **AI-Driven Personalization:** Use LLMs to generate highly relevant, non-generic outreach at scale.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Import the Workflow
- Download or copy the workflow from the n8n Template Store.
- In your n8n editor, click **Import** and paste the workflow JSON, or use the "Use Template" button.

### 2. Configure Required Credentials
- **Postgres:** Set up a Postgres credential for event and analytics logging.
- **SMTP:** Add your email provider's SMTP credentials for sending emails.
- **OpenAI:** Add your OpenAI API key for AI-powered nodes.
- **Slack:** Add your Slack API credential for notifications.
- **Enrichment APIs:** Add credentials for any external enrichment APIs you use.

### 3. Customize Lead Source
- Replace the test data in the `Load Test Leads` node with your real lead source (e.g., webhook, CRM, Google Sheets, etc.).

### 4. Adjust Compliance & Suppression Logic
- Update the suppression lists and geo/GDPR logic in the relevant nodes to match your organization's requirements.

### 5. Review Multichannel Logic
- The workflow simulates LinkedIn and WhatsApp sends. Replace these with real integrations if needed.

### 6. Database Preparation
- Ensure your Postgres database has the following tables (or adjust node configs):
  - `lead_events` (for all event logs)
  - `analytics_daily` (for daily summary rows)
  - `meetings` (for scheduled meetings)
  - `execution_runs` (for workflow run metadata)

### 7. Test the Workflow
- Run the workflow manually with sample data.
- Check the database and Slack for logs and notifications.
- Review AI-generated content for tone and compliance.

## Configuration Details

- **Rate Limiting:** Email, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp sends are rate-limited and respect quiet hours.
- **A/B Testing:** Each email uses a randomly selected subject variant for ongoing optimization.
- **AI Models:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini by default; can be swapped for other models.
- **Event Logging:** Every action (enrichment, outreach, reply, status change) is logged with timestamp and payload for full traceability.
- **Analytics:** Aggregates by lead score, channel, and status; calculates rates and averages.
- **Slack Notifications:** Posts a summary of each run, including key metrics and AI-generated insights.

---

## Advanced Customization

- **Add/Replace Enrichment APIs:** Plug in any HTTP-based enrichment service.
- **Custom Lead Scoring:** Adjust the scoring logic in the `Compute Lead Score` node to fit your ICP.
- **Custom AI Prompts:** Edit the system messages in AI nodes for your brand voice.
