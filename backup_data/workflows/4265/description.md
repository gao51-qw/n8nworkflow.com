🤖 What This Workflow Does
This workflow turns your Telegram bot into a personal email assistant powered by AI.

With just a message on Telegram, users can:

Send an email via Gmail

Automatically generate the email content using OpenAI Models.

Get confirmation or responses directly in Telegram

It's like ChatGPT meets Gmail, inside your Telegram chat.

🔧 How It Works
Telegram Trigger – Listens for incoming messages from your bot.

AI Agent – Processes the input using OpenAI Model and converts it into structured email content (To, Subject, Body).

Memory Node – Stores short-term context per user (via chat ID), so the agent can hold simple conversations.

Gmail Node – Sends the generated email using your Gmail account.

Telegram Node – Replies to the user confirming the output or status.

🧠 Why This is Useful
Ever wanted to send an email while on the go, without typing the whole thing out in Gmail?

This is a fast, intuitive, and AI-powered way to:

Dictate or draft emails from anywhere

Create an AI-powered virtual assistant via Telegram

Integrate n8n's Langchain Agent with real-world productivity use cases

🪜 Setup Instructions
