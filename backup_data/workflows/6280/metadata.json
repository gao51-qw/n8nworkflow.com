  "description": "## How it works\n1. This automation helps revive expired property listings by:\n2. Reading listing data from a Google Sheet that tracks all properties.\n3. Filtering listings where the last_activity date is older than 30 days.\n4. Generating a personalized email using OpenAI (GPT-4) to re-engage the owner.\n5. Sending the email to the property owner using Gmail or SMTP.\n6. (Optional): Updating the listing's status to followed_up in the Sheet once the email is sent.\n7. This workflow ensures no opportunity is missed by proactively reactivating cold leads.\n\n\n## Set Up Steps\n1. **Prepare your Google Sheet**\n   - Create a Google Sheet with these columns:\n     - `title`, `owner_name`, `email`, `property_type`, `location`, `last_activity`\n   - Fill in sample data for testing.\n\n2. **Connect Google Sheets in n8n**\n   - Add a **Google Sheets node**.\n   - Use the \"Read Rows\" operation to load the listing data.\n\n3. **Filter listings inactive for 30+ days**\n   - Use a **Set node** to convert `last_activity` to a Date.\n   - Add an **IF node** or **Code node** to check if the listing is older than 30 days.\n\n4. **Generate email content with OpenAI**\n   - Add an **OpenAI node**.\n   - Use dynamic input (e.g. owner name, property type) to create a follow-up message.\n\n5. **Send the email**\n   - Add a **Gmail node** or **SMTP node** to send the email to the property owner.\n\n6. **(Optional) Update status**\n   - Use a **Google Sheets \"Update Row\" node** to change the listing's status to `followed_up`.\n\n7. **Test the full workflow**\n   - Manually trigger the workflow or schedule it to run daily/weekly.\n",
