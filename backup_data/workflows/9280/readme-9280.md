## Why Use This Workflow?

- **Time Savings:** Automates ticket generation & delivery. reduces manual processing for 200 attendees from ~3 hours to &lt;5 minutes.
- **Cost Reduction:** Removes dependency on paid ticketing platforms for basic events — save up to $150–$300/month for small organizations.
- **Error Prevention:** Single-source truth in Google Sheets with QR-based check-in reduces double-checkin and human errors by &gt;90%.
- **Scalability:** Runs on a schedule and webhooks; scales from dozens to thousands of tickets (watch API/email quotas).



## Ideal For

- **Event Organizers / Community Managers:** Sell & distribute tickets for meetups, runs, and local events with immediate QR delivery.
- **Operations / Venue Staff:** Fast, reliable check-in via mobile scanner POSTing to webhook for instant validation.
- **Small Agencies & SaaS Teams:** Lightweight, low-cost ticketing backend that integrates with existing Google accounts.



## How It Works

1. **Trigger (Registration):** `POST /v1/register` receives registration payload (nama, email, no_hp, jumlah_tiket, total_price, payment_method).
2. **Data Collection (Registration):** Validate input → check existing participant in Register sheet → append registration.
3. **Processing (Ticket Generation):** Scheduled job (START runs every minute) finds rows with Payment Status = PAID and Email Sent = NO.
4. **Intelligence Layer:** For each ticket: generate unique Ticket ID (TL-YYYYMMDD-XXXX-N-HASH), build QR payload JSON, create QR image via qrserver API, and build HTML email with embedded base64 QR.
5. **Output & Delivery:** Send ticket email(s) via Gmail; write one Tickets row per generated ticket and mark Email Sent = YES in Register.
6. **Storage & Logging:** All participant & ticket records persisted to Google Sheets; check-in events update row (Checked In = YES and Checkin TIme).

### Core Endpoints

- Registration webhook: `POST /v1/register`
- Scanner webhook (check-in): `POST /v1/scanner`

### Event Metadata

- **Event:** TABRAK_LARI
- **Event date:** 15 November 2025
- **Event location:** GOR Pontianak



## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Type | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| [n8n instance]([https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)) | Essential | Host the workflow and webhooks |
| Google account (Sheets + Gmail) | Essential | Store tickets & send emails |
| Google Sheet | Essential | Register & Tickets data store |
| Public webhook URL / reverse proxy | Essential | Expose /v1/register & /v1/scanner to scanners/clients |
| qrserver.com (public API) | Optional | Generate QR images (no credentials) |

&gt; **Important:** Make sure your n8n instance URL is publicly accessible or use a tunneling/reverse proxy so webhooks can receive POSTs.

### Installation Steps

1. Import the JSON into your [n8n instance([https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/khmuhtadin)).
2. **Configure credentials:**
   - **Google Sheets OAuth2:** Grant access to Google Drive & Sheets API (spreadsheets.readonly & spreadsheets).
   - **Gmail OAuth2:** Grant send email scope (Gmail send).
3. **Update environment-specific values:**
   - Verify Google Sheet ID.
   - Set the public base URL for ticket scanner clients to POST /v1/scanner.
4. **Customize settings:**
   - Event name/date/location (variables in Generate Ticket Data / Build HTML Email).
   - Email sender address and subject line in Gmail node.
5. **Test execution:**
   - Use a sample POST to `/v1/register` with valid fields to create a registration.
   - Mark a row as PAID and Email Sent = NO to trigger scheduled ticket generation.
   - Simulate a scanner POST to `/v1/scanner` with the barcode JSON payload to test check-in.



## Technical Details

### Core Nodes

| Node | Purpose | Key Configuration |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| REGISTER (Webhook) | Accepts registration POSTs | Path: `/v1/register` |
| Validate Input (Code) | Server-side validation | Validates nama, email, no_hp, jumlah_tiket, payment_method |
| Get Participant (Google Sheets) | Check duplicate email | Filters Register tab by Email |
| Store Data (Google Sheets) | Append registration | Tab: Register (gid=0) |
| START (Schedule Trigger) | Finds paid registrations | Runs every 1 minute |
| Get Rows (Google Sheets) | Reads Register rows | Reads full Register tab |
| Filter Paid Not Sent (Filter) | Finds rows with Payment Status=PAID & Email Sent=NO | Filter node conditions |
| Generate Ticket Data (Code) | Generate ticket IDs & QR payloads | Ticket ID format TL-YYYYMMDD-XXXX-N-HASH |
| Generate QR Code (HTTP Request) | Calls qrserver.com to build PNG | URL: https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=... |
| Build HTML Email (Code) | Builds ticket HTML & embeds Base64 QR | Template contains ticket details & QR |
| Send Email (Gmail) | Sends ticket email | To: recipient Email; Subject configurable |
| Update Sheet (Tickets) | Append ticket rows | Tab: Tickets (gid=2010454173) |
| Parse Data (Code) | Aggregates ticket IDs per email | Updates Register with combined ticket IDs |
| SCAN TICKET (Webhook) | Check-in endpoint | Path: `/v1/scanner` |
| Parse Barcode (Code) | Parses incoming scanner payload | Expects JSON in body.barcode |
| Get Tickets (Google Sheets) | Lookup ticket by Ticket ID | Filters Tickets tab by Ticket ID |
| Ticket Available? (If) | Validates existence & Checked In status | Branches to update or return error |
| Update Ticket Status (Google Sheets) | Mark Checked In = YES | Sets Checkin TIme to scannedAt |
| Checked IN / Already Checked IN (RespondToWebhook) | Respond payloads for scanner | JSON responses with status & metadata |

### Workflow Logic

- **Registration:** Writes to Register sheet. A scheduled job picks up PAID rows where Email Sent = NO; for each row it generates one record per ticket, calls the QR API for an image, sends an email per ticket (multi-ticket support), then appends Tickets rows and marks Email Sent = YES by updating the Register sheet with combined ticket IDs.
- **Check-in:** The scanner webhook accepts barcode JSON, extracts ticket_id, looks up the Tickets sheet, prevents duplicate check-ins by checking "Checked In" flag, and updates sheet with check-in timestamp on success.

## Customization Options

### Basic Adjustments

- **Email Template:** Edit Build HTML Email node to change branding, copy, or layout.
- **Ticket ID Format:** Change code in Generate Ticket Data to alter prefix or hash length.
- **Event Metadata:** Change event_name, event_date, event_location in code nodes.

### Advanced Enhancements

- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with payment gateway (e.g., webhook from Stripe) to automatically set Payment Status = PAID — complexity: medium.
- **Cloud Storage for QR Images:** Use cloud storage (S3) for QR images instead of base64-embedding — complexity: medium-high.
- **Batch Email Provider:** Use batch email provider (SendGrid/Mailgun) for high-volume events to reduce Gmail quota risks — complexity: medium.


## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Invalid QR / scanner returns "Invalid QR code format" | Scanner payload not sending barcode JSON or malformed JSON | Ensure scanner POST body contains valid JSON string under body.barcode; validate payload in Parse Barcode node |
| Ticket exists but cannot update | Google Sheets API auth / permission error | Reconnect Google Sheets OAuth2 credential; ensure the service account/user has edit access to the sheet |
| Emails not sent | Gmail OAuth2 credential missing or Gmail API quota reached | Reauthorize Gmail credential; consider switching to SendGrid/Mailgun for large volumes |
| Duplicate check-in allowed | Logic checking "Checked In" value mismatch (case/format) | Normalize the Checked In field values and use strict comparisons in Ticket Available? node |
| Slow generation for many tickets | Sequential QR calls and sends | Use parallel execution or a dedicated email service; increase worker resources for n8n instance |

## Use Case Examples

### Scenario 1: Community Fun Run (200 attendees)

- **Challenge:** Manual QR generation and emailing takes ~3 hours.
- **Solution:** After marking registrations as PAID, the scheduled job generates 200 QR tickets and emails them automatically.
- **Result:** Ticket prep completed in &lt;5 minutes; volunteer time reduced by ~3 hours.

### Scenario 2: Regional Festival (2,000 tickets)

- **Challenge:** High volume requires reliable delivery and check-in speed.
- **Solution:** Use this workflow but replace Gmail with a transactional email provider (SendGrid) and host n8n on a scalable instance. Monitor Google Sheets and email provider quotas.
- **Result:** Automated delivery scales; on-site check-in handled via the /v1/scanner endpoint with near-instant validation.
