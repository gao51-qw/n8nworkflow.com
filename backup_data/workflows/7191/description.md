# Automating WhatsApp replies in Go High Level with Redis and Anthropic
## Description
* Integrates GHL + Wazzap with Redis and an AI Agent using ClientInfo to process messages, generate accurate replies, and send them via a custom field trigger.
---
## Who’s it for
* This workflow is for businesses using **GoHighLevel (GHL)**, including the **Wazzap** plugin for WhatsApp, who want to automate inbound SMS/WhatsApp replies with AI. It’s ideal for teams that need accurate, data-driven responses from a predefined **ClientInfo** source and want to send them back to customers without paying for extra inbound automations.

## How it works / What it does
1. **Receive message** in n8n via Webhook from GHL (**Customer Replied (SMS)** automation). WhatsApp messages arrive the same way using the **Wazzap** plugin.
2. **Filter message type**:
   * If audio → skip processing and send fallback asking for text.
   * If text → sanitize by fixing escaped quotes, escaping line breaks/carriage returns/tabs, and removing invalid fields.
3. **Buffer messages** in Redis to group multiple messages sent in a short window.
4. **Run AI Agent** using the **ClientInfo** tool to answer only with accurate service/branch data.
5. **Sanitize AI output** before sending back.
6. **Update GHL contact** custom field (**IA_answer**) with the AI’s response.
7. **Send SMS reply** automatically via GHL’s outbound automation triggered by the updated custom field.

## How to set up
1. In **GHL**, create:
   * **Inbound automation**: Trigger on *Customer Replied (SMS)* → Send to your n8n Webhook.
   * **Outbound automation**: Trigger when **IA_answer** is updated → Send SMS to the contact.
   * Create a custom field named **IA_answer**.
2. Connect **Wazzap** in GHL to handle WhatsApp messages.
3. Configure **Redis** in n8n (host, port, DB index, password).
4. Add your **AI model** credentials (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) in n8n.
5. (Optional) Set up the **Google Drive Excel Merge** sub-workflow to enrich ClientInfo with external data.

## Requirements
* **GoHighLevel sub-account API key**.
* **Anthropic (Claude)** API key or another supported LLM provider.
* **Redis database** for temporary message storage.
* **GHL automations**: one for inbound messages to n8n, one for outbound replies when **IA\_answer** is updated.
* **GHL custom field**: **IA\_answer** to store and trigger replies.
* **Wazzap plugin** in GHL for WhatsApp message handling.

## How to customize the workflow
* Add more context or business-specific data to the **AI Agent prompt** so replies match your brand tone and policies.
* Expand the **ClientInfo** dataset with additional services, branches, or product details.
* Adjust the **Redis wait time** to control how long the workflow buffers messages before replying.
