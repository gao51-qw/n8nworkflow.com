  "description": "# 🎙️ AI Video Speech Correction & Multilingual Voiceover Generator\n\n### Create Professional Explanation Videos — Without Re-Recording Your Voice  \nThis workflow was built to solve a **real, painful creator problem**:  \nyou know *what* to explain, but you don’t like how you sound, hesitate while speaking, or don’t feel fluent enough on camera.\n\nWith this automation, you can **record freely and imperfectly**, and the system will:\n- transcribe what you said,\n- **clean and rewrite your speech** into a clear, structured explanation,\n- generate a **natural AI voiceover**,  \n- perfectly **retime the video** so visuals still match the narration,\n- and even **output the video in multiple languages**.\n\nYou focus on explaining.  \nThe AI handles clarity, fluency, tone, and delivery.\n\n---\n\n### Who This Is Built For  \n✅ **Educators & trainers** creating walkthroughs or LMS videos  \n✅ **Consultants & SaaS founders** recording product explanations  \n✅ **Content creators** who dislike their recorded voice  \n✅ **Non-native speakers** who want fluent, professional narration  \n✅ **Agencies** producing multilingual explainer content at scale  \n\nIf you’ve ever thought *“I know this, I just don’t say it well”* — this is for you.\n\n---\n\n### What This Workflow Does (Technically & Practically)\n\n1. **Upload an MP4 video** via a simple form (Telegram / webhook-based).\n2. The system:\n   - Extracts the original audio\n   - Transcribes speech with AI\n3. Each spoken segment is:\n   - Matched with an on-screen video frame.\n   - **Rewritten by AI** to remove fillers, hesitations, slang, or unclear phrasing.\n   - Adjusted to match on-screen context and timing.\n4. The cleaned script is:\n   - Converted into **high-quality AI voiceover** with precise synchronization.\n5. The video is then:\n   - **Retimed scene-by-scene** so visuals align with the new narration.\n   - Reassembled into a clean, professional final video.\n6. The output can be:\n   - Generated in **multiple languages** (e.g. EN / AR).\n   - Delivered via **Telegram** and/or uploaded to **Google Drive**.\n\nResult:  \n🎥 A polished explanation video — without re-recording a single sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Workflow Is Extremely Valuable\n\n- **No need to re-record** takes because of mistakes or accent issues  \n- **Perfect for tutorials & demos** where clarity matters more than personality  \n- **Multilingual by design** — same video, different languages  \n- **Consistent tone & pacing** across all videos  \n- **Zero manual editing** once deployed  \n\nThis replaces:\n- multiple retakes,\n- manual script rewriting,\n- external voiceover tools,\n- and timeline guessing in video editors.\n\n---\n\n### Why Buy This Instead of Building It Yourself\n\n- **Save 40–60 hours** of R&D \n- Avoid extremely tricky **audio/video retiming problems**  \n- Get a **production-grade workflow**, not a demo script  \n\nThis is the kind of system most people *try* to build and abandon halfway.\n\n---\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- n8n (self-hosted strongly recommended)\n- Server with:\n  - **FFmpeg & FFprobe**\n  - SSH + SFTP access\n- **OpenAI API key** (Whisper + TTS)\n- Optional:\n  - Google Drive (for archiving)\n  - Telegram bot (for delivery)\n\n⚠️ Video retiming and audio synthesis are CPU/RAM intensive.  \nUse a server sized for video workloads.\n\n---\n\n### Customization Options\n- Supported languages (e.g. EN, AR — easily extendable)\n- AI rewriting style (formal, friendly, instructional)\n- Voice personality and tone\n- TTS voice selection per language\n- Output destinations (Telegram, Drive, S3, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line 💡  \nThis workflow lets you **think out loud**, make mistakes, and still end up with a **studio-quality explanation video**.\n\nNo mic anxiety.  \nNo re-recording.  \nNo language barrier.\n\nJust explain → AI perfects → video is ready.\n\n---\n\n👉 **By purchasing this template, you receive:**  \n- Full n8n workflow JSON\n- **Step-by-step setup guidelines** by email  \n- **Basic email support**  \n\nThis is not just automation — it’s **confidence at scale**.",
