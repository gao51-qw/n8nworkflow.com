  "description": "## 📘 Description\nThis workflow automates the complete DPDP-aligned Consent Manager Registration screening pipeline — from intake to eligibility evaluation and final compliance routing.\nEvery incoming registration request is normalized, validated, logged, evaluated by an AI compliance engine (GPT-4o), and then routed into either approval or rejection flows.\nIt intelligently handles missing documentation (treated as a minor issue), evaluates financial/technical/operational capacity, generates structured eligibility JSON, updates registration records in Google Sheets, and sends outcome-specific emails to applicants and compliance teams.\n The workflow creates a full audit trail while reducing manual screening workload and ensuring consistent eligibility decisions.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n▶️ Receive Consent Registration Event (Webhook)\n Collects incoming Consent Manager registration applications and triggers the processing pipeline.\n🧹 Extract & Normalize Registration Payload (Code Node)\n Cleans the body payload and extracts key fields:\n action, organizationName, applicationType, contactEmail, netWorth, technicalCapacity, operationalCapacity, documentAttached, submittedAt.\n🔍 Validate Registration Payload Structure (IF Node)\n Checks the presence of mandatory fields.\n Valid → continue to eligibility evaluation\n Invalid → log in the audit sheet.\n📄 Log Invalid Registration Requests to Sheet (Google Sheets)\n Stores malformed or incomplete submissions for audit, follow-up, and retry handling.\n📝 Write Initial Registration Entry to Sheet (Google Sheets)\n Creates the initial intake row in the master registration sheet before applying eligibility logic.\n🧠 Configure GPT-4o — Eligibility Evaluation Model (Azure OpenAI)\n Prepares the AI model used to determine whether the applicant meets DPDP’s eligibility criteria.\n🤖 AI Eligibility Evaluator (DPDP Compliance)\n Analyzes applicant data and evaluates their eligibility based on:\n financial capacity, technical capability, operational readiness, and documentation status.\n Missing documents → NOT a rejection condition.\n Returns strictly formatted JSON with: eligible, riskLevel, decisionReason, missingItems, recommendedNextSteps.\n🧼 Parse AI Eligibility JSON Output (Code Node)\n Converts AI output into valid JSON by removing markdown artifacts and ensuring safe parsing.\n🔎 Validate Eligibility Status (IF Node)\n Routes the outcome:\n Eligible → approval workflow\n Ineligible → rejection email.\n📧 Send Rejection Email to Applicant (Gmail)\n Sends a structured rejection email listing issues and re-submission instructions.\n🔗 Merge Registration + Eligibility Summary (Code Node)\n Combines raw registration data with AI eligibility results into one unified JSON package.\n📬 Send Approval Email to Compliance Team (Gmail)\n Notifies compliance officers that an applicant passed eligibility and is ready for verification.\n🧩 Prepare Status Update Fields (Set Node)\n Constructs the final status value (e.g., “passed”) for updating the database.\n📘 Update Registration Status in Sheet (Google Sheets)\n Updates the applicant’s record using contactEmail as the key, marking the final eligibility status.\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\nAzure OpenAI (GPT-4o) credentials\nGmail OAuth connection\nGoogle Sheets OAuth connection\nValid webhook endpoint for intake\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Fully automates DPDP Consent Manager registration screening\n ✔ AI-driven eligibility evaluation with standardized JSON output\n ✔ Smart handling of missing documents without unnecessary rejections\n ✔ Automatic routing to approval or rejection flows\n ✔ Complete audit logs for all submissions\n ✔ Reduces manual review time and improves consistency\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n- DPDP compliance teams\n- Regulatory operations units\n- SaaS platforms handling consent manager onboarding\n- Organizations managing structured eligibility workflows\n",
