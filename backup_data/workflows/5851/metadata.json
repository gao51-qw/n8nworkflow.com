  "description": "### Who is this for?\nThis workflow is ideal for n8n self-hosted users, DevOps engineers, and automation developers who want to automatically back up their n8n workflows to GitHub on a regular basis.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving\nManually backing up n8n workflows can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This workflow automates the backup process, ensuring that all workflows are safely stored in a version-controlled GitHub repository every 24 hours.\n\n### What this workflow does\nThis automation runs daily to back up all workflows from your n8n instance to a specified GitHub repository. Each workflow is saved as a .json file using its unique ID, organized into a folder path defined by repo_path. The workflow is designed to manage memory usage efficiently by recursively calling itself. Once the backup is complete, it optionally sends a Slack notification to confirm success.\n\n### Setup\n1. Configure the Config node in the subworkflow to set:\n   - GitHub Repo Owner\n   - GitHub Repo Name\n   - Main folder path (repo_path)\n2. Connect your GitHub and (optionally) Slack credentials.\n3. Set the workflow to run on a daily cron schedule.\n4. Test the workflow manually to confirm the GitHub integration works.\n\nSign up for a [free consultation](https://boanse.gumroad.com/l/free_n8n_consultation) and find out how n8n can help you.",
