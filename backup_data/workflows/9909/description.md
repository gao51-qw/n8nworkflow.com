## Overview

This workflow automates weather forecast delivery by collecting city names, fetching 5-day forecasts from OpenWeatherMap, and generating professionally formatted HTML emails using GPT-4. The AI creates condition-based color-coded reports with safety precautions and sends them via Gmail.

## How It Works

A form trigger collects up to three city names, which are geocoded via OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve coordinates and 5-day forecasts. 

JavaScript nodes process the raw weather data into daily summaries, calculating temperature ranges, precipitation levels, wind speeds, and dominant weather conditions. 

GPT-4 then generates professionally formatted HTML emails with condition-based color coding: The AI intelligently adds contextual safety warnings for heavy rain, extreme heat, high winds, and thunderstorms. 

A validation node ensures proper JSON formatting before Gmail sends the final briefing.
