# Automate Google Classroom: Topics, Assignments & Student Tracking

Automate Google Classroom via the Google Classroom API to efficiently manage courses, topics, teachers, students, announcements, and coursework.

## Use Cases

### Educational Institution Management
Sync rosters, post weekly announcements, and generate submission reports automatically.

### Remote Learning Coordination
Batch-create assignments, track engagement, and auto-notify teachers on new submissions.

### Training Program Automation
Automate training modules, manage enrollments, and generate completion/compliance reports.

## Prerequisites
- n8n (cloud or self-hosted)  
- Google Cloud Console access for OAuth setup  
- Google Classroom API enabled  
- **Google Gemini API key** (free) for the agent brain — or swap in any other LLM if preferred  

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Google Cloud Project
1. Create a new project in **Google Cloud Console**.  
2. Enable **Google Classroom API**.  
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** credentials.  
4. Add your **n8n OAuth callback URL** as a redirect URI.  
5. Note down the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Step 2: OAuth Setup in n8n
1. In n8n, open **HTTP Request Node → Authentication → Predefined Credential Type**.  
2. Select **Google OAuth2 API**.  
3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  
4. Click **Connect my account** to complete authorization.  
5. Test the connection.

### Step 3: Import & Configure Workflow
1. Import this workflow template into n8n.  
2. Link all Google Classroom nodes to your OAuth credential.  
3. Configure the webhook if using external triggers.  
4. Test each agent for API connectivity.

### Step 4: Customization
You can customize each agent’s prompt to your liking for optimal results, or copy and modify node code to expand functionality.  
All operations use **HTTP Request** nodes, so you can integrate more tools via the **Google Classroom API documentation**.  
This workflow provides a strong starting point for deeper automation and integration.
