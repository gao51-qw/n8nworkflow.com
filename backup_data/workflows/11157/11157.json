    "description": "## How it works\n- Runs every morning at 8:00 using the Schedule Trigger.  \n- Sets a `stale_days` value and queries Salesforce for Opportunities where `Stage_Unchanged_Days__c` equals that value and the stage is not Closed Won / Closed Lost.  \n- For each “stale” Opportunity, loads full deal details and sends them to an OpenAI model.  \n- The model uses the `query_soql` tool to pull recent Notes, the primary Contact, and the Opportunity Owner, then returns a single JSON object with:  \n  - a personalized follow-up **email** for the client,  \n  - a short **SMS** template,  \n  - a concise **Slack** summary for the sales team,  \n  - and a ready-to-use **Task** payload for Salesforce.  \n- n8n parses that JSON, sends the email via SMTP, posts the Slack message to your chosen channel, and creates a Salesforce Task assigned to the Opportunity Owner so every stalled deal has a clear next step.\n\n## Setup steps\nEstimated setup time: ~30–45 minutes if your Salesforce, OpenAI, SMTP and Slack credentials are ready.\n\n1. **Create `Stage_Unchanged_Days__c` on Opportunity (Salesforce)**  \n   - Field Type: Formula (Number, 0 decimal places)  \n   - Formula:  \n     ```text\n     IF(\n       ISBLANK(LastStageChangeDate),\n       TODAY() - DATEVALUE(CreatedDate),\n       TODAY() - DATEVALUE(LastStageChangeDate)\n     )\n     ```  \n   - This field tracks how many days the Opportunity has been in the current stage.\n\n2. **Connect credentials in n8n**  \n   - Salesforce OAuth2 for the Salesforce nodes and the `query_soql` HTTP Tool.  \n   - OpenAI (or compatible) credential for the “Message a model” node.  \n   - SMTP credential for the customer email node.  \n   - Slack credential for the internal notification node.\n\n3. **Configure your follow-up rules**  \n   - In **Edit Fields (Set)**, set `stale_days` to the threshold that defines a stalled deal (e.g. 7, 14, 30).  \n   - In **Perform a query**, optionally refine the SOQL (record types, owners, minimum amount, etc.) to match your pipeline.  \n   - Update the **Send Email SMTP Customer** node with your real “from” address and tweak the wording if needed.  \n   - Point **Send Message To Internal Team (Slack)** to the right channel or user.\n\n4. **Test safely**  \n   - Turn off the Schedule Trigger and run the workflow manually with a few test Opportunities.  \n   - Inspect the AI output in **Message a model** and **Parse JSON** to confirm the structure (`email`, `sms`, `slack`, `task.api_body`).  \n   - Check that the email and Slack messages look good and that Salesforce Tasks are created, assigned to the right Owner, and linked to the correct Opportunity.\n\n5. **Go live**  \n   - Re-enable the Schedule Trigger.  \n   - Monitor the first few days to confirm that follow-ups, Slack alerts, and Tasks all behave as expected, then let the automation quietly keep your pipeline clean and moving.",

otherwise “Hi there,”.\n  - Intro: who you are + why you’re reaching out (reference Opportunity Name in natural language:\n    e.g., “your order for mobile generators”).\n  - Context: mention that things have been quiet / unchanged for a while, referencing notes if possible.\n  - Value: 1–3 sentences focusing on next steps, clarifying questions, or how you can help.\n  - CTA: clear and simple (e.g., propose a time to talk, ask for confirmation/feedback).\n  - Signature:\n    - Include Owner.Name (and Owner.Email if available).\n    - Include company name or generic role (“Sales Team”) if needed.\n- Do NOT invent discounts, promises, or contractual commitments that are not mentioned.\n\nSMS:\n- Very short and to the point.\n- Assume they know who you/your company are (add a short identifier like “– <Owner Name>, <Company>”).\n- Use a clear CTA (e.g., “Reply if you’d like to schedule a quick call this week.”).\n- If Contact.Phone is missing, still generate an SMS template as if it will be sent to the right number later.\n\nSLACK (INTERNAL TEAM):\n- Target: Opportunity Owner and sales / deals channel.\n- Include:\n  - Opportunity Name, StageName, Amount, CloseDate, Stage_Unchanged_Days__c.\n  - Account/Contact name (if available).\n  - Short summary of key insights from Notes.\n  - Short summary of the angle of the email/SMS (no need to paste the full text).\n- Recommend the next internal action (e.g., “call the client”, “review pricing”, “confirm delivery timeline”).\n- Mention the Owner by name; if your environment supports @mentions, format text in a way that could be used\n\nTASK (for Owner):\n- Purpose: ensure there is a clear owner action in Salesforce linked to this Opportunity.\n- The Task should:\n    - Be assigned to the Opportunity Owner (OwnerId = opportunity.OwnerId or Owner.Id).\n    - Be related to the Opportunity (WhatId = opportunity.Id).\n    - Have a clear Subject describing the follow-up (e.g., “Follow up on stalled opportunity – <Opportunity Name>”).\n    - Have a Description summarizing:\n      - Why the task was created (stage unchanged),\n      - Key context from notes,\n      - The gist of the email/SMS that will be sent.\n    - Use reasonable default fields:\n      - Status: \"Not Started\"\n      - Priority: \"Normal\"\n    - DueDate can be set conceptually to “today” or “tomorrow” as a short text description in the Description,\nbut leave it out of the api_body if you are not given a date field.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with this structure (no extra text, no markdown):\n\n{\n  \"email\": {\n    \"to\":\"email\"\n    \"subject\": \"string\",\n    \"body\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"sms\": {\n    \"to\":\"Phone\"\n    \"body\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"slack\": {\n    \"channel_hint\": \"string\",\n    \"message\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"task\": {\n    \"subject\": \"string\",\n    \"description\": \"string\",\n    \"status\": \"string\",\n    \"priority\": \"string\",\n    \"api_body\": {\n    \"Subject\": \"string\",\n    \"Description\": \"string\",\n    \"Status\": \"string\",\n    \"Priority\": \"string\",\n    \"OwnerId\": \"string\",\n    \"WhatId\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n\n- email.subject: clear and concise.\n- email.body: multi-paragraph email using \"\\n\\n\" for paragraph breaks.\n- sms.body: 1–3 sentences max.\n- slack.channel_hint: short hint to help route this message (e.g., \"#sales\", \"@OwnerName\", \"#opportunity-followup\").\n- slack.message: a concise message summarizing the situation and internal recommendation.\n\nREASONING\n\nBefore you generate the JSON:\n- Think through:\n  - What is the current stage and has it stalled?\n  - What do the Notes say about last interactions and customer concerns?\n  - Who is the primary Contact and how to address them?\n  - Who is the Owner and how to include them in signature and Slack?\n  - What is the most reasonable, low-friction next step for the client?\n  - What does the internal team need to know and do?\n\nThen, generate the JSON output EXACTLY in the specified schema.\n"

Configure credentials: make sure your Salesforce OAuth2, OpenAI API, SMTP and Slack credentials are all valid and selected in their nodes (Salesforce nodes, `query_soql`, `Create Task`, `Send Email SMTP Customer`, Slack node).  \n\n3. Adjust logic: set `stale_days` in the **Edit Fields** node to the number of days you consider a stage to be stalled (e.g. 7, 14). Optionally, refine the Salesforce query in **Perform a query** to match your pipeline rules.  \n\n4. Test safely: disable the **Schedule Trigger**, then run the flow manually on a small set of test Opportunities. Check the AI output in **Message a model** and **Parse JSON**, confirm Tasks are created in Salesforce, and verify the test email and Slack message look correct before re-enabling the schedule for production.\n"
