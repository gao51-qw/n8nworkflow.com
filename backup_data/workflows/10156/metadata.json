If you regularly build reusable, multi-client n8n automations, this template will save you hours of manual work.\n\n---\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case\n\nManual lead handling is **slow and inconsistent**:\n\n- Leads arrive messy across forms, lists, and imports; ownership and priority are unclear.\n- Finding the right decision-maker and a deliverable email takes too long.\n- Outreach copy drifts from brand guidelines, and CRM updates get missed.\n\nThis workflow solves the problem by **creating a reliable pipeline** from capture → enrichment → verification → CRM sync → Outlook draft, cutting handoffs and preserving auditability.\n\n---\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. **Capture and batching** - Triggers on new/updated leads in HubSpot or pulls \"ready\" rows from Google Sheets; processes items sequentially to stay rate-safe.\n\n2. **Normalize and score (ICP)** - Cleans names, company, and domains; applies configurable ICP rules and writes score plus reasoning back to HubSpot/Sheets.\n\n3. **Enrich contacts** - Confirms official company details and identifies likely decision-makers via focused people searches; dedupes and role-normalizes.\n\n4. **Verify emails** - Finds work emails, checks deliverability, and logs confidence and timestamps to a tracking sheet immediately after each result.\n\n5. **Compose outreach** - Calls the approved template in `Email content`; personalizes only the first name; validates structure via `Structured Output Parser`.\n\n6. **Draft in Outlook** - Uses Microsoft Graph to create an HTML draft; embeds an inline signature image fetched from Google Drive.\n\n7. **CRM sync and tasks** - Creates/updates HubSpot contacts and associations, stores the composed email in properties, and opens a next-day follow-up task for the owner.\n\n8. **Safety and observability** - Deterministic prompts, strict parsing, idempotent writes, and clear flags prevent duplicates; optional Slack/Teams alerts for failures.\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Connect your accounts**:\n   - HubSpot (app token)\n   - Microsoft Graph (OAuth2)\n   - Google Sheets\n   - Google Drive\n   - Your LLM provider (for `Level 2 Orchestrator` and `Email content`)\n\n2. **Set your credentials** in the respective nodes.\n\n3. **Adjust the Google Sheet IDs** to match your own sheet structure.\n\n4. **Map HubSpot properties** (owner, contact/company IDs, custom fields for score, reasoning, and email content).\n\n5. **Paste your approved HTML** in `Email content` and upload your signature image to Drive.\n\n6. **Configure schedule**, batch size, and any Slack/Teams webhooks for notifications.\n\n---\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- **ICP logic**: Edit scoring weights and required qualifiers (industry, region, size, tech stack).\n- **Personas**: Change role detection and caps (e.g., Ops, Finance, Procurement).\n- **Copy control**: Swap the template in `Email content` or add A/B variants while keeping structure validation.\n- **Triggers**: Use webhook capture from forms, list-based pulls, or time-based recrawls.\n- **Delivery**: Switch the mail node to Gmail API if preferred; keep the same compose/verify/track sequence.\n- **Governance**: Add holdouts, opt-out checks, and rate limits per domain or owner; expand logs for export to a data warehouse.\n\n---\n\n✨ With this workflow, you go from **messy inbound leads → verified contacts → synchronized HubSpot records → ready-to-send Outlook drafts** in just minutes, with almost no manual work.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Need help customizing?\n\nContact me for consulting and support:  \n[click here](https://kumarshivam.link/)",
