Generate Weekly n8n Execution Report and Email Summary
```

**Description:**
```
## How it works
- Automatically runs every 7 days to pull all n8n workflow executions from the past week
- Merges execution data with workflow information to provide context
- Generates a professional HTML report with execution statistics (errors, successes, waiting status)
- Sends the formatted report with Outlook or Gmail

## Set up steps

### 1. Configure n8n API Credential
- Go to your n8n instance → Settings → API
- Create a new API token with read access to workflows and executions
- In this workflow, add a new "n8n" credential and paste your API token
- This credential is used by two nodes: "Get all Workflows" and "Get all previous executions"

### 2. Connect Email Services
- Configure your Outlook credential in the "Send a message outlook" node
- Configure your Gmail credential in the "Send a message gmail" node
- Set your preferred email recipients in both nodes

### 3. Adjust Schedule (Optional)
- By default, the workflow runs every 7 days
- Edit the "Schedule Trigger" node to change the interval if needed

## Key features
- Tracks workflow execution status and runtime metrics
- Calculates average and total runtime for each status type
- Provides visual HTML report with color-coded status indicators
- Dual email delivery (Outlook + Gmail options)
- Requires only n8n API credentials (no external API keys needed)
