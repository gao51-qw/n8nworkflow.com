  "description": "This workflow is a user-friendly tool that automates the creation of high-quality advertising images for products. It takes a simple product image uploaded by a user and uses AI to transform it into a professional, photorealistic advertisement featuring a fashion model actively using the product. The final image is then made available for the user to download.\n\nStep-by-Step Breakdown:\nHere is a breakdown of the automated process:\n\nForm Submission: The workflow is triggered by a public form. The user uploads a product image and selects a character model (male or female) from a dropdown menu.\n\nImage Processing: The uploaded image file is extracted and prepared for the AI. This includes converting the binary file data into a format that the AI model can understand.\n\nAI Image Generation: An HTTP request is sent to a large language model (Google's Gemini via OpenRouter). The request includes a prompt that combines the user's selected character model and the uploaded product image. The AI is instructed to generate a new, photorealistic image of the model using the product.\n\nData Conversion: The AI's output, which is a base64 encoded image string, is then processed. The workflow separates the image data from its metadata.\n\nFinal Image Delivery: The base64 data is converted back into a binary file, which is then provided to the user for automatic download via a completion form.",
