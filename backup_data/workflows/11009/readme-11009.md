# Process social media leads with GPT-4.1 summaries, Google Sheets, Jira & Slack

> # Automated Social Media Lead Processing with AI Summaries, Slack Alerts & Jira Ticketing

This workflow automatically collects new lead messages from social media platforms, LinkedIn or web forms, filters relevant marketing inquiries using keywords, classifies and summarizes the lead with AI, logs it to Google Sheets, creates a Jira task and sends Slack notifications. Additionally, it generates weekly lead reports for team insights.  

It reduces manual triage, ensures no valid inquiry is missed and keeps your team updated with both immediate notifications and summary reports.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect your webhook to your social media inbox, LinkedIn, Twitter or web form.  
2. Add your OpenAI, Google Sheets, Jira and Slack credentials.  
3. Enable the workflow.  
4. Send a test message to confirm Google Sheets logging, Slack notification and Jira task creation.  
5. Activate the scheduler for weekly reports to track lead performance.

## What It Does

This workflow performs the following key tasks:

* Filters incoming messages for marketing-related keywords like *ad request*, *promo request*, *collaboration*, *partnership* or *social media inquiry*.  
* Uses OpenAI GPT to classify the lead into categories such as Sales, Support, Partnership, Influencer Inquiry or General Lead.  
* Generates a short AI summary of the message.  
* Logs structured lead data to Google Sheets, including username, source, category, summary and timestamp.  
* Creates a Jira task automatically with summary, description, category and received time.  
* Sends a Slack notification to alert the team instantly.  
* Runs a scheduled workflow that aggregates weekly leads and sends a weekly report to Slack.

This ensures a structured, automated pipeline for capturing, summarizing and assigning leads efficiently.

## Who’s It For

* Marketing and sales teams managing leads from social media and web forms. 
* Agencies handling client campaigns and inquiries.

Sends a formatted message to your selected Slack channel, alerting your team of the new lead.

### 8. Weekly Reporting

* **Schedule Trigger** – triggers the weekly reporting workflow.  
* **Extract Lead Data** – fetches all logged leads from Google Sheets.
