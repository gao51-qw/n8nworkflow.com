# Social Media Posting Automation with Image and Caption

## How it works
This AI-powered workflow streamlines your social media posting process, transforming hours of manual caption writing, image uploading, and scheduling into a fully automated system. You define the topic and image once, and the workflow handles caption generation, review, approval, and posting to your selected platforms.

### Automated Flow

1. **Generate Caption**  
   Trigger the workflow manually and set your post topic and image URL in the Set node. The AI (GPT-4.1-mini) generates a high-quality, engaging social media caption tailored to your audience, platform, and content goals.

2. **Store in Google Sheet**  
   The generated caption, along with your image URL and post metadata, is automatically appended to your Google Sheet. This creates a central location to review and manage all your social media content.

3. **Review and Approve**  
   You review the generated caption in the sheet, make any edits if needed, and update the status to **Approved**. You can also select the platform(s) where you want to post.

4. **Automatic Posting**  
   Once the status is updated to Approved, the next workflow is triggered automatically. It posts your caption and image to the selected social media platform(s) without any further manual effort.

**The result?**  
A seamless, end-to-end social media posting process where captions are AI-generated, stored, reviewed, and posted automatically. Focus on strategy and engagement instead of repetitive manual posting.
