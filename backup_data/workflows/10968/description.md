### Context

Hi! I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of the startup [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).

I created this workflow for my mother, who is currently learning English, to turn the **BBC 6 Minute English** podcast into ready-to-use English lessons.

[![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-20.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKugAVZWgKM)

The lesson includes vocabulary, exercises and discussion questions along with links to access the podcast content (audio and transcript).

&gt; Use this assistant to automatically share English lessons from a renowned podcast.

### Who is this template for?

This template is designed for:

- **ESL teachers** who want a fresh, structured lesson every week from real-life audio
- **Independent learners** who want a guided way to study English with podcasts
- **Language schools or content creators** who send regular English lessons by email

### What does this workflow do?

This workflow acts as an **AI-powered English lesson generator** from podcast episodes.

1. **Runs every Sunday at 20:00** using a Schedule Trigger and reads the BBC **6 Minute English** RSS feed  
2. **Checks a Data Table of archived episodes** and filters out those already sent (using their `guid`)  
3. **Keeps the latest unsent episode** and loads its web page content via HTTP  
4. **Parses the HTML** in a Code node to extract the episode **description**, full **transcript** and BBC **vocabulary list**  
5. **Calls three AI nodes** (OpenAI) to generate:
   - a motivational **email hook message**
   - **fill-in-the-blank vocabulary exercises**
   - **discussion questions** related to the topic  
6. **Combines all vocabulary words** and sends them to **ElevenLabs** to generate a slow-paced audio track for listening practice  
7. **Builds a prettify HTML email** that includes: title, description, hook, vocabulary list, exercises, discussion questions and resource links  
8. **Sends the final lesson by email** via the Gmail node, with the vocabulary audio attached  

For example, this is the latest email generated by the workflow:

*P.S.: You can customise the footer to your school or company identity.*

### 🎥 Tutorial

I advise you to check the tutorial on my YouTube channel for the details on how to set up the nodes and customise the content:

### Next Steps

Follow the stickers to set up all the nodes:

- Replace the **Data Table** reference with your own (storing at least `guid`, `title`, `link`, `processed_date`)  
- Set up your **OpenAI** credentials in the three Model nodes  
- Set up your **ElevenLabs** credentials and choose a voice in the audio node  
- Configure your **Gmail** credentials and recipient email address in the Send Email node  
- Adapt the **RSS feed URL** if you want to track another podcast or source  
- Customise the **HTML email** (colours, logo, footer text) in the `Prepare Email` Code node  
- Adjust the **schedule** (time or frequency) if you prefer another cadence
