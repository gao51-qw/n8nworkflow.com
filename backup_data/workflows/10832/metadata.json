This workflow transforms rough drafts into polished, SEO-optimized content while preserving original meaning — and includes human review before final publication. 🚀✍️\n\n## What This Template Does\n- Step 1: Trigger the optimization from Chat or manual run: Starts the optimization process using the Chat Trigger node, passing topic, content ID, and customization parameters. 💬\n- Step 2: Retrieve contextual knowledge: Pulls historical versions from Google Sheets and relevant company information from Pinecone vector storage to guide consistent optimization. 📚\n- Step 3: Fetch SERP competitor data: Uses SerpAPI to gather ranking competitors, headings, snippets, PAA questions, and search intent to strengthen the optimized draft. 🔍\n- Step 4: Run AI content optimization: AI Agent (GPT-4o-mini) rewrites the draft without starting from scratch, improving structure, SEO, tone, clarity, and keyword coverage. 🤖\n- Step 5: Enforce structured JSON output: Ensures the optimized draft follows a strict JSON schema containing title, meta description, sections, keywords, and metadata. 🧩\n- Step 6: Request human review in Slack: Sends the optimized draft to Slack and waits for approval (approve/reject). Team members can refine or confirm before finalization. 💬🧑‍💼\n- Step 7: Save approved version back to Google Sheets: Updates or appends a new version in the content_versions sheet with metadata, SEO fields, and version history. 📊\n- Step 8: Send success confirmation to Slack: Posts a notification confirming that the approved draft has been published. 🔔\n\n## Key Benefits\n✓ Eliminates manual editing and SEO refinement\n ✓ Produces consistent, high-quality, conversion-focused content\n ✓ Ensures factual accuracy and tone preservation\n ✓ Enhances content using SERP-based competitor insights\n ✓ Maintains version history for auditability\n ✓ Introduces structured human approval workflow\n ✓ Fully automated publishing pipeline\n\n## Features\n- AI-assisted rewrite using GPT-4o-mini\n- Google Sheets version retrieval + updating\n- Pinecone knowledge base retrieval\n- SERP competitor and keyword intelligence\n- Slack approval workflow (sendAndWait)\n- Structured JSON output enforcement\n- Version incrementing & metadata tracking\n- Secure credentials management\n\n## Requirements\n- OpenAI API Key (GPT-4o-mini or higher)\n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials\n- SerpAPI Key\n- Slack Bot Token with chat:write\n- Pinecone API and vector index\n- Pre-created Google Sheet for versioning\n- Optional: Existing company knowledge stored in Pinecone\n\n## Target Audience\n1.
