  "description": "### How It Works ⚙️\n\nThis workflow is a comprehensive, AI-powered system that acts as a virtual support manager. It automates the entire process of handling incoming support tickets, ensuring speed, accuracy, and efficiency.\n\n1.  **Ticket Ingestion**: The workflow starts when a new email arrives in your support inbox via the **Gmail Trigger**.\n2.  **AI Analysis & Triage**: An **OpenAI** node acts as an intelligent agent, instantly analyzing the email to categorize the issue, assign a priority, and determine the customer's sentiment (e.g., \"Angry,\" \"Neutral\").\n3.  **Proactive Escalation**: The workflow uses an `If` node to check for \"Critical\" priority or \"Angry\" sentiment. If these conditions are met, it takes a separate path to notify a manager immediately.\n4.  **Ticket Creation**: Regardless of urgency, a **Trello** card is created for the ticket, including all the AI's analysis and the original email content.\n5.  **Automated Response**: For low-priority tickets, a second `If` node and a **Gmail** node can send an automated, AI-generated response, completely freeing up your team.\n6.  **Performance Reporting**: All ticket data, including the AI's analysis, is logged to a **Google Sheets** dashboard for real-time analytics and to track support trends.\n\n### How to Set Up 🛠️\n\n1.  **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance.\n2.  **Configure Credentials**:\n    * **Gmail**: Add your OAuth2 credential for your support inbox.\n    * **OpenAI**: Add your API Key.\n    * **Trello**: Add your API Key and token.\n    * **Slack**: Add your Bot Token credential.\n    * **Google Sheets**: Add your OAuth2 credential.\n3.  **Customize Workflow Nodes**:\n    * **Node 1 (`Gmail Trigger`)**: Ensure this is connected to your official support email address.\n    * **Node 2 (`OpenAI`)**: The prompt is pre-configured but can be customized to better fit your specific categories or tone.\n    * **Node 4 (`Trello`)**: Replace `[YOUR TRELLO BOARD LIST ID]` with the list ID for new tickets on your board.\n    * **Node 5 (`Slack`)**: Replace `[MANAGER'S SLACK USER ID]` and `[YOUR SUPPORT TEAM SLACK CHANNEL ID]` with the correct IDs.\n    * **Node 9 (`Google Sheets`)**: Replace `[YOUR SUPPORT DASHBOARD SPREADSHEET ID]` with your spreadsheet ID and ensure your sheet columns match the workflow's data.\n4.  **Save & Activate**: Once all settings and credentials are configured, save the workflow and click the \"Inactive\" toggle in the top-right corner to make it live.",
