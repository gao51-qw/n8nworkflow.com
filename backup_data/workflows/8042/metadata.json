  "description": "## How it works\n- Triggers manually or on schedule (03:00 daily by default)  \n- Fetches workflows tagged `backup-workflows` via n8n API  \n- Normalizes workflow names and applies `[client: NAME]` tag convention  \n- Prepares JSON in the same structure as an n8n UI export  \n- Checks GitLab repository:  \n  - Create new file if missing  \n  - Update file if content differs  \n  - Skip if unchanged  \n- Logs results with recap (created, updated, unchanged, total)  \n\n## Set up steps\n- Configure your GitLab credentials in n8n  \n- Create a repository and branch for workflow backups  \n- Set global variables (owner, project, branch, backup path)  \n- Tag workflows to include with `backup-workflows`  \n- Run manually once to test, then enable the schedule  ",
