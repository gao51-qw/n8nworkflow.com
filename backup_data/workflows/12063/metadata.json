This workflow automatically processes bookings, enriches data with AI insights, and keeps your team informed via Slack—all in real-time.\n\n### What This Workflow Does\n\n**🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence**\n- **Smart Company Detection**: Automatically identifies company names from guest email domains\n- **Booking Categorization**: Uses Google Gemini to classify bookings (Sales/Support/Interview/Partnership/Media)\n- **Meeting Brief Generation**: AI creates actionable preparation notes for hosts before each meeting\n\n**⚡ Automated Processing**\n- Receives webhooks from TimeRex for confirmed and cancelled bookings\n- Validates requests with security token verification\n- Logs enriched booking data to Google Sheets\n- Sends detailed Slack notifications with AI-generated insights\n\n**🛡️ Security & Reliability**\n- Token-based webhook authentication\n- Security alerts for unauthorized access attempts\n- Automatic cancellation handling with data cleanup\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- **Sales Teams**: Automatically categorize leads and prepare meeting briefs\n- **Recruitment**: Streamline interview scheduling with AI-powered candidate insights\n- **Customer Success**: Track support meetings and prepare context for calls\n- **Media Relations**: Manage press interviews with automated briefings\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. TimeRex sends a webhook when a booking is confirmed or cancelled\n2. Security token is verified (failed attempts trigger Slack alerts)\n3. For confirmed bookings:\n   - Media source is detected from calendar name\n   - Company name is extracted from email domain\n   - AI categorizes the booking purpose\n   - AI generates a meeting preparation brief\n   - Enriched data is saved to Google Sheets\n   - Slack notification is sent with AI insights\n4. For cancellations:\n   - Booking is found by Event ID\n   - Row is deleted from Google Sheets\n   - Cancellation alert is sent to Slack\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Webhook Configuration**\n   - Copy the webhook URL from the \"TimeRex Webhook\" node\n   - Paste it in TimeRex Settings → Webhook\n\n2. **Security Token**\n   - Copy your TimeRex security token\n   - Update the `Verify Security Token` node with your token\n\n3. **Google Sheets**\n   - Create a spreadsheet with these columns:\n     `event_id`, `booking_date`, `guest_name`, `guest_email`, `calendar_name`, `meeting_url`, `host_name`, `media_source`, `company_name`, `booking_category`, `ai_meeting_brief`, `created_at`\n   - Update all Google Sheets nodes with your Sheet ID\n\n4. **AI Credentials**\n   - Connect your Google Gemini API credentials to both AI model nodes\n\n5. **Slack**\n   - Connect your Slack account\n   - Select your notification channel in all Slack nodes\n\n6. **Activate**\n   - Turn on the workflow and start receiving AI-enhanced booking notifications!\n\n### Requirements\n\n- TimeRex account with webhook access\n- Google Cloud account (for Sheets & Gemini API)\n- Slack workspace\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n\n### Customization Tips\n\n- Modify the `Filter by Calendar Type` node to match your calendar naming convention\n- Adjust AI prompts in the LLM Chain nodes for different categorization or brief styles\n- Add more media sources to the Media Master sheet for accurate source tracking\n- Extend the workflow with email confirmations or calendar event creation\n\n---\n\n## Short Description (100 characters max)\n\nAutomate TimeRex bookings with AI-powered categorization, meeting briefs, and Slack notifications.\n\n---\n\n## Categories\n\n- Sales\n- Productivity\n- AI\n- Scheduling\n\n---\n\n## Tags\n\nTimeRex, Booking, AI, Google Gemini, Slack, Google Sheets, Automation, Meeting Management, LLM, Scheduling\n",
