Automatically research new leads in your target area, structure the results with AI, and append them into Google Sheets — all orchestrated in n8n.

## ✅ What this template does

- Cleans and structures the output into proper JSON using **OpenAI**  
- Appends the new leads directly into **Google Sheets**, skipping duplicates  

&gt; **Trigger:** Manual — “Start Workflow”

## 👤 Who’s it for
- **Sales & marketing teams** who need to prospect local businesses  
- **Agencies** running outreach campaigns  
- **Freelancers** and consultants looking to automate lead research

## ⚙️ How it works
1. **Set Location** → define your target area (e.g., *Hershey PA*)  
2. **Get Current Leads** → pull existing data from your Google Sheet to avoid duplicates  
3. **Research Leads** → query Perplexity for 20 businesses, excluding already-scraped ones  
4. **Write JSON** → OpenAI converts Perplexity output into structured Company/Email arrays  
5. **Split & Merge** → align Companies with Emails row-by-row  
6. **Send Leads to Google Sheets** → append or update leads in your sheet
