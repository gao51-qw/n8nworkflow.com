  "description": "## How it works\nThis workflow captures webinar feedback through a webhook and normalizes the submitted data for processing. It stores raw feedback in Google Sheets, uses an AI model to understand sentiment and intent, and generates a personalized response. A professional HTML thank-you email is sent automatically to each attendee. All replies and delivery details are logged back into the spreadsheet for tracking.\n\n## Step-by-step\n- **Receive webinar feedback**\n  - **Feedback Webhook** – Accepts feedback submissions from a webinar form in real time.\n  - **ID Generation** – Creates a human-readable, unique feedback ID for tracking.\n  - **Normalize Feedback** – Cleans and standardizes incoming fields like name, email, rating, and comments.\n\n- **Store and enrich feedback**\n  - **Store Partial** – Saves the raw feedback data into Google Sheets.\n  - **Common Resources** – Attaches shared webinar resources such as recordings and slides.\n\n- **Analyze feedback with AI**\n  - **Message a model** – Evaluates sentiment, engagement level, and intent using an AI model.\n  - **Parse AI Response** – Extracts structured insights like segment, reply text, and next steps.\n\n- **Generate and send follow-up**\n  - **Merge** – Combines feedback data, AI response, and resources.\n  - **Build Email HTML** – Creates a clean, professional HTML email tailored to each attendee.\n  - **Send AI Thank You Email** – Sends the personalized follow-up via Gmail.\n\n- **Log final outcome**\n  - **Store Feedback** – Updates Google Sheets with the sent email content, timestamp, and status.\n\n## Why use this?\n- Save time by automating webinar feedback follow-ups end to end.\n- Ensure every attendee receives a thoughtful, personalized response.\n- Maintain a complete feedback and communication log in one place.\n- Improve engagement without sounding promotional or generic.\n- Scale post-webinar communication without manual effort.\n",
