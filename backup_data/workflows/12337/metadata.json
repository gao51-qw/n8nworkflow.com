  "title": "Create a daily visual journal from Discord chats with GPT-4, DALL-E and Notion",
  "description": "I wanted a journal but never had the discipline to write one. Most of my day happens in Discord anyway, so I built this to do it for me.\n\nEvery night, it reads my Discord channel, asks GPT-4 to write a short reflection, generates an image that captures the vibe of the day, and saves everything to Notion. I wake up with a diary entry I didn't have to write.\n\n**How it works**\n1. Runs daily at whatever time you set\n2. Grabs messages from a Discord channel (last 100)\n3. Filters to today's messages only\n4. GPT-4 writes a title, summary, mood, and tags\n5. DALL-E generates an image based on the day's themes\n6. Uploads image to Cloudinary (Notion needs a public URL)\n7. Creates a Notion page with everything formatted nicely\n\n**Setup**\n- Discord Bot credentials (read message history permission)\n- OpenAI API key\n- Free Cloudinary account for image hosting\n- Notion integration connected to your database\n\n**Notion database properties needed**\n- Title (title)\n- Date (date)\n- Summary (text)\n- Mood (select): 😊 Great, 😌 Good, 😐 Neutral, 😔 Low, 🔥 Productive\n- Message Count (number)\n\nTakes about 15 minutes to set up. I use Gallery view in Notion with the AI image as cover - looks pretty cool after a few weeks.",
