Never walk into a meeting unprepared again!

This workflow automatically researches your meeting contacts every morning and emails you the latest news and insights about the companies you're meeting with today.

✅ Step 1: Set Your Morning Briefing Time
Open the Every morning @ 7 Schedule Trigger and adjust the time when you'd like to receive your daily meeting briefings. The default is set to 9 AM.

✅ Step 2: Connect Your Google Calendar
Link your Google Calendar credentials to the Get meetings for today node. This allows the workflow to scan your calendar for external meetings.

✅ Step 3: Connect Your Tavily Research API
Add your Tavily API key to the Research Company/Person node. This powers the intelligent research that finds recent news and insights about your meeting contacts.

✅ Step 4: Link Your Gmail Account
Connect your Gmail credentials to the Send news node so your research briefings can be automatically delivered to your inbox each morning.

✅ Step 5: Customize Your Email Settings
In the Send news node, update:

Send To: Your email address
Sender Name: Customize how the emails appear in your inbox

✅ Step 6: Activate the Workflow
Once everything is connected, set the workflow to active so it runs automatically each morning and keeps you prepared.
