Loops Through Calls for Processing**  \n- **Ensures resilience** by allowing failed runs to **restart where they left off**.  \n- Processes calls **one at a time** to prevent **Notion rate limits**.  \n\n### **5. Sends Call Data to an AI Processor**  \n- Extracts structured call details and **sends them to an AI-powered analysis workflow**.  \n- Allows **multiple AI agents** to process and extract structured data from calls.  \n\n### **6. Provides Real-Time Slack Alerts**  \n- Posts a **progress update** in Slack when the queue starts processing.  \n- Sends **real-time call progress notifications**.  \n- Sends a **completion alert** once all calls are processed.  \n\n## **How to Set Up This Workflow**  \n\n### **1.
