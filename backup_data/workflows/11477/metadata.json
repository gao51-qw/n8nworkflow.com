  "description": "## About This Template\nTurn every sales meeting into a coaching opportunity. This workflow automatically analyzes **tldv** meeting recordings using **OpenAI (GPT-4)** to provide instant, actionable feedback to your sales team.\n\nIt acts as a virtual sales coach, evaluating key performance metrics like listening skills, question quality, and customer engagement without requiring a manager to listen to every call.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Trigger:** The workflow starts automatically when a meeting transcript is ready in tldv (via Webhook).\n2. **Data Retrieval:** It fetches the full meeting details and transcript from the tldv API.\n3. **AI Analysis:** GPT-4 analyzes the conversation to score the sales rep's performance (e.g., Speaking vs. Listening balance, Clarity, Next Steps).\n4. **Delivery:**\n    * **Slack:** Sends a summary notification and a detailed markdown report to the team channel.\n    * **Google Sheets:** Archives the scores and meeting data for long-term tracking.\n\n## Who It’s For\n* **Sales Managers:** To monitor team performance and identify coaching needs at scale.\n* **Account Executives:** To get immediate feedback on their calls and self-correct.\n* **Sales Enablement:** To track KPI trends over time.\n\n## Requirements\n* **n8n** (Cloud or Self-hosted)\n* **tldv (Business Plan)** for API/Webhook access\n* **OpenAI API Key** (GPT-4 access recommended)\n* **Slack** Workspace\n* **Google Sheets**\n\n## Setup Steps\n1. **Credentials:** Configure \"Header Auth\" for tldv (`x-api-key`) and OpenAI (`Authorization`). Connect OAuth for Slack and Google Sheets.\n2. **Webhook:** Copy the Production URL from the first node (Webhook) and add it to your tldv **Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Webhooks** (select Event: `TranscriptReady`).\n3. **Google Sheets:** Create a sheet (e.g., named `Sales Feedback`) with columns for `Meeting Name`, `Score`, `Summary`, etc.\n   * *Note: Be sure to update the Google Sheets node in the workflow to match your specific Sheet Name and Column headers.*",
