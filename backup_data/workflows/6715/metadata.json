  "title": "Magento 2: auto-fix missing image alt tags with product name",
  "description": "### This n8n workflow connects to a Magento 2 store and automatically updates product images that are missing alt tags (labels). It fetches product data via the Magento 2 REST API, identifies media gallery entries with empty or null labels, and updates them by assigning the corresponding product name as the alt text.\n\n#### This is useful for:\n\n- Improving SEO and accessibility by ensuring all product images have descriptive alt tags.\n- Automating manual content cleanup tasks for product catalogs.\n- Keeping your store compliant with basic accessibility and usability standards.\n\n#### ⚙️ How It Works\n- Manual Trigger\n- The workflow is designed to run manually or on a schedule (can be modified).\n- Fetch Product Data\n- The Get All Product Skus HTTP node pulls a paginated list of products using Magento's REST API\n- The Split Out and Loop Over Items nodes iterate through each product.\n- Filter Products With Images\n- The If node checks if a product has at least one image.\n- Label Missing Alt Texts\n- The Code node inspects each image's label field. If it's empty or null, it sets it to the product’s name.\n- Update Back to Magento 2\n- The HTTP Request (PUT) node updates each product using Magento’s V1/products/:sku endpoint, sending the updated image labels back to the store.\n\n#### 🧠 Use Case\nProblem: Magento 2 stores often have hundreds or thousands of product images, and it’s common to miss assigning alt text (label) to all of them—especially for bulk-imported or older products.\n\n#### Solution: This workflow ensures every product image has an alt label (minimum: product name), thus improving:\n\n- Search engine optimization (SEO)\n- Product discovery\n- Accessibility compliance (WCAG)\n- Store quality score (for marketplaces or audits)\n\n#### 🧪 Requirements\n- Magento 2 REST API access\n- A valid Bearer Token for Magento 2\n- Magento endpoint URL\n- Basic understanding of how your store handles image paths and media entries\n\n#### 🔒 Credentials Required\nMagento 2 Bearer Auth: Set up as a credential in n8n using your Magento 2 API access token.\n\n#### 🛠️ Modifications You Can Make\n- Increase the pageSize in the GET request to process more products per run.\n- Set up a Cron trigger to run this regularly.\n- Update other missing fields like position, disabled, or types programmatically.\n- Include logging or email notifications after each batch update.\n\n#### 🧰 Helpful For\n- Magento Developers & Store Managers\n- SEO/Accessibility Compliance Teams\n- Automation Engineers managing eCommerce workflows\n\n#### 📂 Category\nE-commerce → Magento 2 (Adobe Commerce)\n\n#### 💬 Need Help?\n💡 Having trouble setting it up or want to customize this workflow further?\nFeel free to reach out — I’m happy to help with setup, customization, or Magento 2 API integration issues.\n\nContact: Author\n\n#### 👤 Author\n**Kanaka Kishore Kandregula**\nCertified Magento 2 Developer\nhttps://gravatar.com/kmyprojects\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kanakakishore",
