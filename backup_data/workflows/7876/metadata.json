  "description": "## What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow creates a comprehensive error monitoring system for your n8n instance by automatically capturing workflow failures, logging them to Google Sheets, and sending immediate email notifications.\n\n**Step by step:**\n1. **Error Trigger** automatically activates whenever any workflow in your n8n instance encounters an error or failure\n2. **Google Sheets - Create Error Log** captures and stores comprehensive error details in a spreadsheet including workflow information, node details, timestamps, and full error stack traces\n3. **Gmail - Send Notification** dispatches immediate email alerts with formatted error summaries containing workflow names, failed nodes, error descriptions, and direct links to failed executions\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Copy the Google Sheets template structure** from this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-vLBAKolEvaL0qQDjckHmvC1S6_hxHbgSP8CLyngSs/edit?gid=0#gid=0 - This step is crucial as it provides the correct column structure for error logging\n2. **Connect your Google Sheets account** to the Google Sheets node and update the document ID to point to your copied error logging spreadsheet\n3. **Connect your Gmail account** to the Gmail node for sending error notifications\n4. **Update the Gmail recipient email** from \"n8n_log_template@yopmail.com\" to your preferred notification email address\n5. **Customize email subject and message format** according to your notification preferences and organizational needs\n6. **Test the workflow** by intentionally creating a small error in a test workflow to verify the logging and notification system works correctly\n7. **Monitor your error logs** regularly through the Google Sheets document to identify patterns and recurring issues\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n* **Add multiple notification recipients**: modify the Gmail node to send alerts to different team members or create separate nodes for different notification channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)\n* **Customize error filtering**: add conditional logic to only log certain types of errors or exclude specific workflows from monitoring\n* **Enhance error categorization**: add additional columns to your Google Sheets template for error severity levels, affected systems, or resolution status tracking\n* **Set up error escalation**: create time-based triggers that send follow-up notifications for unresolved errors after specific time periods\n\n## Need help customizing?\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**",
