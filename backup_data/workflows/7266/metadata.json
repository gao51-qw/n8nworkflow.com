  "description": "## How it works\nEvery day at 6:00 AM, the workflow pulls all events from your Google Calendar scheduled for that day.\nIt extracts each event’s ID, title, and start time, aggregates them into one list, and converts them into a text string.\nThis text is passed to an AI-powered Information Extractor (using Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to format the events into a clear daily summary.\nFinally, the summary is sent as a Telegram message to your chosen chat ID, giving you a ready-to-read daily to-do list.\n\n## How to use\n\nConnect your Google Calendar account to the Get many events node.\n\nSet the correct calendar in the calendar field.\n\nLink your Telegram account and set your chatId in the Send a text message node.\n\nAdjust the Schedule Trigger node if you want a different reminder time.\n\nActivate the workflow — it will run daily and send your event summary to Telegram automatically.\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\nReminder time: Change triggerAtHour in the Schedule Trigger node for morning, evening, or multiple reminders per day.\n\nCalendar source: Switch to another Google Calendar or add multiple Get many events nodes for different calendars.\n\nMessage style: Edit the Information Extractor system prompt to change language, formatting, or level of detail in your summary.\n\nDelivery channel: Replace or add another messaging node (e.g., Email, Slack, WhatsApp) if you want your to-do list in different apps.\n\nEvent filtering: Add a filter before aggregation to include only certain event types or keywords (e.g., “Meeting”, “Deadline”).",
