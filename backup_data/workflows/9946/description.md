## Scrape & Import Products to Shopify from Any Site (with Variants & Images)-(Optimized for shoes)

### This advanced n8n template automates e-commerce operations by scraping product data (including variants and images) from any URL and creating fully detailed products in your Shopify store.

This workflow is essential for dropshippers, e-commerce store owners, and anyone looking to quickly import product catalogs from specific websites into their Shopify store.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

### How it works
* The workflow reads a list of product page URLs from a **Google Sheet**.
Your sheet, with its columns for **Product Name** and **Product Link**, acts as a **database for your workflow**.

* The **Loop Over Items** node processes products one URL at a time.
* Two **BrowserAct** nodes run sequentially to scrape all product details, including the `Name`, `price`, `description`, `sizes`, and `image links`.
* A custom **Code** node transforms the raw scraped data (where fields like sizes might be a single string) into a structured JSON format with clean lists for `sizes` and `images`.
* The **Shopify** node creates the base product entry using the main details.
* The workflow then uses a series of nodes (**Set Option** and **Add Option** via HTTP Request) to dynamically add **product options** (e.g., "Shoe Size") to the new product.
* The workflow intelligently uses **HTTP Request** nodes to perform two crucial bulk tasks:
    1.  Create a unique **variant** for each available size, including a custom SKU.
    2.  Upload all associated **product images** from their external URLs to the product.
* A final **Slack** notification confirms the batch has been processed.
