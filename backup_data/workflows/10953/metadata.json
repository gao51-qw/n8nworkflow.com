  "description": "## Description\n💸💬 Slack Pro is powerful — but the price hurts, especially for growing teams. This workflow is designed as a **low-cost alternative solution** that provides some Slack Pro functions (**searchable history + AI summaries**) while you stay on the **free Slack plan (or minimal paid seats)**.\n\nWhat is the advantage?\n- 🧠 **AI Slack assistant on demand** – @mention the bot in any channel to get clear summaries of recent discussions (“yesterday”, “last 7 days”, “this week”, etc.).\n- 🗄️ **External message history** – recent messages are routinely saved into Google Drive, so important conversations live outside Slack’s 90-day / 10k-message limit.\n- 💰 **Cost-efficient setup** – rely on Slack free plan + a little Google Drive storage + low-cost AI API, instead of paying Slack Pro ($8.75 USD per user / month).\n- 📚 **Business value** – you keep the benefits you wanted from Slack Pro (memory, context, easy catch-up) while avoiding a big monthly bill.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Upgrade your Slack for free with AI chat summaries & history archiving\n\n### **👥 Who’s it for**\n- 💰 **Teams stuck on Slack Free because Pro is too expensive** (e.g. founders, small teams)\n  - Want longer history and better context, but can’t justify per-seat upgrades.\n  - Need “Pro-like” benefits (search, memory, recap) in a **budget-friendly way**.\n\n### **⚙️ How it works**\n- 📝 **Slack stays as your main chat tool**: People talk in channels the way they already do.\n- 🤖 **You add a bot powered by this workflow**: When someone @mentions it with something like (*@SlackHistoryBot summarize this week*).\n- 📆 **On a schedule (e.g. monthly), it backs up channels**: Walks through channels the bot can access and saves recent messages (e.g. last 30 days) as a CSV file into Google Drive.\n\n### **🛠️ How to set up**\n\n1. **🔑 Connect credentials (once)**\n   - **Slack (Bot / App)**: [recommend other tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q2unQEvjcQ)\n     - Create and configure a bot.\n     - Create a credential.\n     - Invite the bot to channels you want to cover.\n   - **Google Drive**\n     - Connect a Google account for storage.\n     - Create a folder like `Slack History (Archived)` in Drive and select it in the workflow.\n   - **AI Provider (e.g. DeepSeek)**\n     - Grab any LLM API key.\n     - Plug it into the AI node so summaries use that model.\n\n2. **🚀 Quick Start**\n\t- Import the JSON workflow.\n\t- Attach your credentials.\n\t- Save and activate the workflow.\n\t- Try a real-world test:\n\t\t- In a test channel, have a short conversation.\n\t    - Then try `@(your bot name) summarize today`.\n\t- Check that archives appear:\n\t    - Manually trigger the “archive” part from your automation tool.\n\t    - You should see files named after your channels and time period in Google Drive.\n\n## 🧰 **How to Customize the Workflow**\n1. **Limit where it runs**\n   - Only invite the bot to “high value” channels (projects, clients, leadership).\n   - This keeps both AI and storage usage under control.\n2. **Adjust archive frequency** ⏰\n   - Monthly is usually enough; weekly only for critical channels.\n   - Less frequent archives = fewer operations = lower cost.\n1. **Customize the summary style (system prompt) **📃\n   - What language to use (e.g. Chinese by default, or English, or both).\n   - How to structure the summary (topics, bullets, separators).\n   - What to focus on (projects, decisions, tasks, risks, etc.).\n\n### 📩 Help & customize other slack function\n**Contact:** owenlzyxg@gmail.com\n\n\n",
