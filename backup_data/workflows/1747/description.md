**Task:**
Merge two datasets into one based on matching rules

**Why:**
A powerful capability of n8n is to easily branch out the workflow in order to process different datasets. Even more powerful is the ability to join them back together with SQL-like joining logic.

**Main use cases:**
 - Appending data sets
 - Keep only new items
 - Keep only existing items
