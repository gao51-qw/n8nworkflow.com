### Who is this for?  
This workflow is perfect for content creators, newsletter publishers, digital marketers, and virtual assistants who need a quick way to generate professional newsletters from trending news without manually curating and formatting articles.  

---  

### What problem is this workflow solving?  
Manually searching for news, summarizing articles, formatting them into a newsletter, and sending them by email is time-consuming and inconsistent. This workflow automates the process end-to-end: from capturing a keyword in Telegram to sending a ready-to-publish HTML newsletter by Gmail.  

---  

### What this workflow does  
The workflow begins when a keyword is received from Telegram. The keyword is expanded into trending suggestions using Dumpling AI Autocomplete, then passed to Dumpling AI Google News to fetch recent articles. The results are structured, split, and scraped for clean content. The combined content is sent to OpenAI to generate a professional HTML newsletter and subject line, which is finally delivered to a chosen inbox via Gmail.
