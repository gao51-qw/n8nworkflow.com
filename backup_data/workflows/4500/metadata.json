  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nThis template is ideal for **developers, DevOps engineers, and automation managers** who manage their n8n workflows using GitHub. It helps teams streamline their CI/CD automation by syncing changes from GitHub directly into n8n after a pull request (PR) is merged.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nManually restoring workflows after reviewing and merging code in GitHub can be tedious and error-prone. This workflow solves that by **automating the restore process**, ensuring that any new or updated workflow committed to your GitHub repo is automatically imported into your n8n environment.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n- Triggers when a GitHub pull request is **closed and merged**.\n- Fetches the details of the merge commit.\n- Retrieves the list of **added and modified workflow files**.\n- Downloads and decodes each workflow file.\n- **Creates or updates** the corresponding workflow in your n8n instance automatically.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Connect GitHub**: Use the `GitHub Trigger` node and configure GitHub API credentials.\nNote: I'd recommended to use *GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) classic* with `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` permission scopes enabled.\n2. **Connect n8n API**: Provide your n8n API credentials in the `n8n` nodes. - [Check this doc](https://docs.n8n.io/api/authentication/)\n3. **Set repository variables**: Update `github_owner` and `repo_name` in the **Define Local Variables** node.\n4. **Enable webhook**: Make sure your GitHub repository has a webhook for `pull_request` events pointing to this workflow.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n- Modify filters to handle only certain branches or file paths.\n- Add Slack or email notifications to confirm successful imports.\n- Insert logging or version tagging for better traceability.\n- Extend with conditional logic for workflow testing before applying changes.\n\nThis automated flow provides a seamless CI/CD loop between GitHub and n8n, empowering teams to manage workflow versioning efficiently and securely.",
