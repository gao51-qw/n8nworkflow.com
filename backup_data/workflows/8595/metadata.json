  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nSocial-media managers, growth hackers, and brands who want to keep their Instagram accounts active by auto-liking posts from *specific profiles* they track—without scrolling feeds manually.  \n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs every 2 h.  \n2. **Profile Post Extractor** pulls up to 20 recent posts from each Instagram profile in your CSV.  \n3. **Select Cookie** rotates Instagram session-cookies.  \n4. **Get Random Post** picks one and checks against `instagram_posts_already_liked.csv`.  \n5. Builds `instagram_posts_to_like.csv`, uploads to SharePoint.  \n6. **Phantombuster Autolike Agent** likes the post.  \n7. Liked URLs are appended to prevent duplicates.  \n8. **Wait nodes** throttle activity (~12 likes/profile/day).  \n\n## How to set up  \n1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  \n   • `instagram_session_cookies.txt` (one per line).  \n   • `instagram_posts_already_liked.csv` (header `postUrl`).  \n   • `profiles_instagram.csv` with profile URLs.  \n3. Adjust schedule if needed.  \n4. Activate the workflow—likes will run automatically.  \n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33+  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan  \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant  \n\n## How to customize  \n- Add/remove tracked profiles in `profiles_instagram.csv`.  \n- Adjust throttle by changing `Wait` intervals.  \n- Swap SharePoint for Google Drive/Dropbox if needed.
