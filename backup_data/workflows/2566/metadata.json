  "description": "This n8n template combines an AI agent with n8n's multi-page forms to create a novel interaction which allows automated question-and-answer sessions. One of the more obvious use-cases of this interaction is what I'm calling the AI interviewer.\n\n**You can read the full post here:** [https://community.n8n.io/t/build-your-own-ai-interview-agents-with-n8n-forms/62312](https://community.n8n.io/t/build-your-own-ai-interview-agents-with-n8n-forms/62312)\n\n**Live demo here:** [https://jimleuk.app.n8n.cloud/form/driving-lessons-survey](https://jimleuk.app.n8n.cloud/form/driving-lessons-survey)\n\n## How it works\n\n* A form trigger is used to start the interview and a new session is created in redis to capture the transcript.\n* An AI agent is then tasked to ask questions to the user regarding the topic of the interview. This is setup as a loop so the questions never stop unless the user wishes to end the interview.\n* Each answer is recorded in our session set up earlier between questions.\n* When the user requests to end the interview we break the loop and show the interview completion screen.\n* Finally, the session is then saved in a Google Sheet which can then be shared with team members and for the purpose of data analysis.\n\n## How to use\n\n* You'll need to be on a n8n instance that is accessible to your target audience. **Not technical enough to setup your own server? [Try out n8n cloud](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/ee7izbliiw0n) and instantly deploy template!**\n* Remember to activate the workflow so the form trigger is published and available for users to use.\n\n## Requirements\n* Groq LLM for AI agent. Feel free to swap this out for any other LLM.\n* Redis(-compatible) storage for capturing sessions\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n* The next step would be adding tools! AI interviews with knowledge retrieval could definitely open up other possibilities. Eg. An onboarding wizard generating questions by pulling facts from internal knowledgebase.\n",
