  "description": "\nThis workflow fetches **deals and their notes from Pipedrive**, cleans up stage IDs into names, aggregates the information, and uses **OpenAI** to generate a daily summary of your funnel.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n### 1️⃣ Set Up OpenAI Connection\n1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)  \n2. Navigate to [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)  \n3. Add funds to your billing account  \n4. Copy your API key into the **OpenAI credentials** in n8n  \n\n### 2️⃣ Connect Pipedrive\n1. In **Pipedrive** → **Personal preferences → API** → copy your **API token**  \n   - URL shortcut: `https://{your-company}.pipedrive.com/settings/personal/api`  \n2. In **n8n** → **Credentials → New → Pipedrive API**  \n   - **Company domain**: `{your-company}` (the subdomain in your Pipedrive URL)  \n   - **API Token**: paste the token from step 1 → **Save**  \n3. In the **Pipedrive nodes**, select your Pipedrive credential and (optionally) set filters (e.g., owner, label, created time).\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How It Works\n- **Trigger**: Workflow runs on manual execution (can be scheduled).  \n- **Get many deals**: Pulls all deals from your Pipedrive.  \n- **Code node**: Maps `stage_id` numbers into friendly stage names (`Prospecting`, `Qualified`, `Proposal Sent`, etc.).  \n- **Get many notes**: Fetches notes attached to each deal.  \n- **Combine Notes**: Groups notes by deal, concatenates content, and keeps deal titles.  \n- **Set Field Names**: Normalizes the fields for summarization.  \n- **Aggregate for Agent**: Collects data into one object.  \n- **Turn Objects to Text**: Prepares text data for AI.  \n- **OpenAI Chat Model + Summarize Agent**: Generates a **daily natural-language summary** of deals and their current stage.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Example Prompts\n- “Summarize today’s deal activity.”  \n- “Which deals are still in negotiation?”  \n- “What updates were added to closed-won deals this week?”  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact\nNeed help extending this (e.g., send summaries by Slack/Email, or auto-create tasks in Pipedrive)?\n\n- 📧 **rbreen@ynteractive.com**  \n- 🔗 **[Robert Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/)**  \n- 🌐 **[ynteractive.com](https://ynteractive.com)**\n",
