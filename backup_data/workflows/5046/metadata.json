  "description": "This n8n workflow automates support ticket handling with AI-driven classification, response generation, and safety checks. Responses are based solely on your Mintlify documentation, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reduced manual effort in customer support.\n\n**✅ Trigger: New Ticket Received**\nThe workflow is triggered whenever a new support ticket is created.\n\n**🔍 Check for Assignee**\nIf the ticket is already assigned to a human agent, the bot does nothing and exits.\nIf the ticket is unassigned, the bot continues processing.\n\n**🔢 Bot Response Count Check**\nThe workflow checks how many times the bot has already responded to this ticket.\nIf the bot has replied more than 3 times, it stops and waits for a human to take over.\nThis prevents endless loops and flags potentially complex cases for review.\n\n**🧠 AI-Based Ticket Categorization**\nAn AI model analyzes the ticket content and classifies it into one of the following categories:\n1. 🧾 Billing → Sends a predefined billing-related message.\n2. 📢 Advertising → Automatically deletes the ticket.\n3. 🚨 Fraud → Sends a predefined fraud-related message.\n4. ❓ Other → Proceeds to generate a dynamic response.\n\n**🤖 Mintlify Integration**\nFor tickets categorized as \"Other\", the customer’s question is sent to the Mintlify API, which returns a documentation-based answer.\n\n**✍️ AI Response Formatter**\nThe raw response from Mintlify is passed to an AI model that:\nSummarizes and rewrites the answer in a clear, friendly tone\nLimits the response to 120 words\nAdds conversational elements like “Hi,” “Thanks,” and a proper closing\n\n**🛡️ AI Confidence Filter**\nA second AI model reviews the formatted response to ensure it sounds confident and accurate.\nIt looks for uncertainty phrases like:\n- “I’m not sure”\n- “I don’t have enough information”\n- “It depends…”\nIf the response is flagged as uncertain, the workflow stops and waits for a human agent to respond.\n\n**📤 Send Response & Update Ticket**\nIf the response passes the confidence check:\nThe reply is sent to the customer\nThe ticket status is updated to “Pending”",
