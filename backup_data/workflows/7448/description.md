- **Google Sheets Trigger** monitors a spreadsheet for new post titles
- Only processes posts with "pending" status

#### **4. Image Processing & Storage**

- Files are shared with public access permissions
- Image URLs are stored back in the spreadsheet for tracking

#### **5. LinkedIn Publishing**
