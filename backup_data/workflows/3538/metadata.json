  "description": "Automatically generate short AI avatar videos based on trending news, then post them across social media platforms—fully automated using n8n, HeyGen, ChatGPT, and Blotato.\n\n### Tools & Services Used:\n\n- n8n (Self-hosted required due to Community Nodes)\n- HeyGen (for creating AI avatar videos)\n- OpenAI (for script and caption generation)\n- Blotato (for social media distribution)\n- Hacker News (for sourcing trending articles)\n\n\n### Workflow Overview:\n\nThis automation performs the following steps:\n\n1. Fetches trending news from Hacker News\n2. Generates a short script using ChatGPT\n3. Creates an AI avatar video with HeyGen\n4. Generates platform-specific captions\n5. Posts the content across social media with Blotato\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\nMake sure you have active accounts and API keys for:\n\n- HeyGen\n- OpenAI\n- Blotato\n\n\n\n### How to Use This Template\n\nStep 1: Import the Template\n\n1. Open your self-hosted n8n instance  \n2. Go to \"Workflows\" &gt; \"Create Workflow\"  \n3. Click the three dots (…) &gt; \"Import from File\"  \n4. Upload the downloaded JSON file  \n\nStep 2: Configure API Keys\n\nOnly two nodes need customization:\n\n- `Setup HeyGen`: Add your HeyGen API key, avatar ID, and voice ID\n- `Prepare for Publish`: Add your Blotato API key, account IDs, and page IDs\n\nOptional platforms like Pinterest and Bluesky are already disabled by default.\n\n### Finding Your HeyGen Avatar & Voice IDs\nTo customize the AI avatar video:\n\nLog into your HeyGen Dashboard\n\nNavigate to \"Avatars\" → choose or create an avatar → copy the Avatar ID\n\nNavigate to \"Voices\" → select a preferred voice → copy the Voice ID\n\nYou can upload a custom avatar or voice if you have access to those features in your plan\n\nThis allows you to align the video style with your brand’s tone and personality.\n\n### Initial Test Run\n\nFor your first run:\n\n1. Shorten the AI script in the prompt to 5 seconds\n2. Enable only one social media platform\n3. Adjust the wait time to 2 minutes to speed up testing\n4. Verify that the video is created and successfully posted\n\nOnce successful, enable more platforms and scale your automation.\n\nWorkflow Diagram:\n![Screen Shot 20250415 at 23.05.43.png](fileId:1115)\n\n\n\n### Use Cases\n\n- Business owners automating daily content\n- Creators scaling short-form video production\n- Freelancers offering automation as a service\n- Anyone building an AI-driven media workflow\n\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis workflow uses Community Nodes, which only function on self-hosted n8n instances.\nThis workflow may not work on n8n Cloud without some modifications.\n\n",
