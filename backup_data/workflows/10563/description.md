## Overview

This n8n template automates Walmart product discovery and sends clean results to Google Sheets on a fixed schedule (default: every 4 hours). It uses **ScrapeOps Proxy API** for resilient page fetches (with JS render + scroll) and **ScrapeOps Parser API** for structured data extraction (title, price, rating, reviews, image, URL, sponsored flag). The result is a repeatable, low-maintenance workflow for market research, price monitoring, and assortment tracking; ideal for ops and growth teams that need fresh data without babysitting scrapers.

## Who is this for?

* **E-commerce operators** tracking price & inventory signals
* **Market/competitive analysts** building price baskets and trend views
* **Growth & SEO teams** validating product coverage and SERP facets
* **No-code/low-code builders** who prefer visual pipelines over custom code

## What problems it solves

* **Reliability:** Offloads JS rendering and scrolling to ScrapeOps to reduce breakage.
* **Structure:** Normalizes fields for analysis-ready rows in Sheets.
* **Scale:** Runs on a timer; no manual downloading or copy-paste.
* **Speed to value:** Simple setup, minimal credentials, immediate output.
