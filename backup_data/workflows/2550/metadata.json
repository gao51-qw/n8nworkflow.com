  "description": "## Instructions\n\nThis automation streamlines the process of **collecting user information** using a Form Node, enabling individuals to join a **waitlist managed via Google Sheets.**\n\nIt also **generates a verification code**, prompting users to input this code in the Second Form Step. If the code is _nvalid, the workflow keeps the user in a verification loop until a valid code is entered.\n\nOnce a **valid code is provided**, the workflow proceeds to the final step, where **additional information** can be collected.\n\nAll e**ntered data and intermediate states** are securely **stored in the Google Sheet**.\n\n### Structure of the GoogleSheet\n\nFirstname | Lastname | Email | Company | Verification-Code | Verified | Intended Use\nMarcel | Claus-Ahrens | foo[at]bar| foobar | abc123 | TRUE | Just testing\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Set Up a Google Sheet: Create a Google Sheet with the specified columns, or customize them to suit your needs.\n2. Verify the \"Send Mail\" Node: Ensure your \"Send Mail\" node is functional, or replace it with another email-sending node.\n3. Customize Texts and Fields: Update email content, form texts, and form fields to align with your specific use case.\n4. Done!\n\n![Image](https://cloud.let-the-work-flow.com/logo-64.png)  \nEnjoy the workflow! ❤️  \n[let the workf low](https://let-the-work-flow.com) — Workflow Automation & Development",
