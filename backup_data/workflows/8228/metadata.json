  "description": "## Learn Supabase Storage Fundamentals with n8n\n\nThis template demonstrates how to integrate **Supabase Storage** with **n8n** for uploading, fetching, generating temporary signed URLs, and listing files. It’s a beginner-friendly workflow that helps you understand how to connect Supabase’s storage API with n8n automation.\n\n---\n\n## Who it’s for\n- Developers and teams new to **Supabase** who want a hands-on learning workflow.  \n- Anyone looking to automate file uploads and retrieval from **Supabase Storage**.  \n- Educators or technical teams teaching Supabase fundamentals with **practical demos**.  \n\n---\n\n## How it works\n1. **Upload File** – A user uploads a file through an n8n form, which gets stored in a Supabase storage bucket.  \n2. **Fetch File** – Retrieve files by providing their filename.  \n3. **Temporary Access** – Generate **signed URLs** with custom expiry for secure file sharing.  \n4. **List Objects** – View all stored files in the chosen Supabase bucket.  \n\n---\n\n## How to set up\n- Create a **Supabase account** and set up a project.  \n- Create a **bucket** in Supabase (e.g., `test-n8n`).  \n- Get your **Project URL** and **Anon Key** from Supabase.  \n- In n8n, create a **Supabase API Credential** using your keys.  \n- Import this workflow and connect it with your credentials.  \n- Run the forms to test file upload, retrieval, and listing.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n- A Supabase project with **storage enabled**.  \n- A configured **Supabase API Credential** in n8n.  \n\n---\n\n## Customization\n- Change the bucket name (`test-n8n`) to your own.  \n- Adjust signed URL **expiry times** for temporary file access.  \n- Replace Supabase with another S3-compatible storage if needed.  \n- Extend the workflow with notifications (Slack, Email) after file upload.  \n\n---\n\n## 📝 Lessons Included\n- **Lesson 1** – Upload file to Supabase storage.  \n- **Lesson 2** – Fetch file from storage.  \n- **Lesson 3** – Create a temporary signed document with expiry.  \n- **Lesson 4** – List all items in Supabase storage.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Prerequisites\n- Supabase account + project.  \n- Project URL and API Key (Anon).  \n- Bucket created in Supabase.  \n- Policy created to allow read/write access.  \n- n8n with Supabase API credentials configured.
