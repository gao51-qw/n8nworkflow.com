This workflow functions by integrating Shopify customers into Odoo customers.

1. Trigger: Shopify – New Customer Created
   The workflow starts when a new customer is added in Shopify.

2. Action: Odoo – Search Contact by Email
   It checks in Odoo to see if a contact already exists with the same email address as the Shopify customer.

3. Condition: Email Match Check
    If a contact with the same email is found, the workflow ends (no duplicate contact is created).
    If no match is found, the workflow proceeds to the next step.

4. Action: Odoo – Create New Contact
   A new contact is created in Odoo using the customer's:
    Full name
    Email address
    Phone number
    Full Address (whichever is available)
