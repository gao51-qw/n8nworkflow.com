# Automate marketing agency client onboarding: Typeform to GDrive + OpenAI research

> ## Who's it for

Marketing agencies, digital agencies, and freelancers who need to streamline their client onboarding process and create consistent, professional documentation for new clients. Perfect for teams handling multiple client intakes who want to save hours of manual setup work while maintaining quality standards.

## What it does

This workflow automates the entire client onboarding journey from the moment a prospect fills out your Typeform intake questionnaire. It instantly creates a complete Google Drive folder structure with 6 main folders and 15+ subfolders tailored for marketing projects, sends the intake information to your team via Slack, generates an AI-powered marketing research brief using OpenAI, implements an approval workflow with revision capabilities, and delivers a professional welcome email to the client. The system ensures nothing falls through the cracks while maintaining consistent quality across all client projects.

## How it works

1. **Intake Trigger**: When a client submits your Typeform intake form, the workflow automatically initiates
2. **Folder Creation**: Creates a branded client folder in Google Drive with organized subfolders for ads, raw footage, product images, research, drafts, and archives
3. **Team Notification**: Posts detailed intake responses to your designated Slack channel for immediate team visibility
4. **AI Brief Generation**: Uses OpenAI to analyze intake responses and generate a comprehensive marketing research document including customer personas, pain points, positioning strategies, and marketing angles
5. **Approval Process**: Sends the brief for team review with built-in approve/revise functionality
6. **Document Creation**: Upon approval, creates a Google Doc with the finalized research brief
7. **Client Communication**: Sends a personalized welcome email to the client confirming their onboarding
