## Overiew

This workflow builds an AI meeting assistant who sends information-dense pre-meeting notifications for a user's upcoming meetings. 

### How It Works

* A scheduled trigger fires hourly and checks for upcoming meetings within the hour.
* When found, a search for last correspondence + recent activity is performed for each attendee.
* Using available correspondance, an AI/LLM is used to summarize this information and generate a short notification message which should help the user prepare for the meeting.
* The notification is finally sent to the user's Slack.
