## **How it works**

### This workflow automates a full weekly monitoring and reporting cycle using AI.

- **Scheduled Trigger**
Every Monday at 9 AM, the workflow starts automatically.

- **AI Agent Configuration**
A system prompt defines the role, objectives, and behavior of your AI agent for web monitoring or research tasks.

- **Language Model via OpenRouter**
The agent uses a powerful model (e.g., DeepSeek from Perplexity) to generate relevant insights.

- **Data Storage in Notion**
The results are saved and updated directly in a connected Notion database.

- **Email Dispatch**
A summary report is automatically sent by email to predefined recipients.

**Customizable elements:**
