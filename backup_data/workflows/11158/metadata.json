  "description": "# Olostep Amazon Products Scraper  \n\nThis n8n template automates Amazon product scraping using the Olostep API.  \nSimply enter a **search query**, and the workflow scrapes multiple Amazon search pages to extract product titles and URLs.  \nResults are cleaned, normalized, and saved into a Google Sheet or Data Table.\n\n## Who’s it for  \n- E-commerce analysts researching competitors and pricing  \n- Product sourcing teams  \n- Dropshippers and Amazon sellers  \n- Automation builders who want quick product lists without manual scraping  \n- Growth hackers collecting product data at scale  \n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Form Trigger**  \n   - User enters a search query (e.g., “wireless bluetooth headphones”).  \n   - The query is used to build the Amazon search URL.\n\n2. **Pagination Setup**  \n   - A list of page numbers (1–10) is generated automatically.  \n   - Each number loads the corresponding Amazon search results page.\n\n3. **Scrape Amazon with Olostep**  \n   - For each page, Olostep scrapes Amazon search results.  \n   - Olostep’s LLM extraction returns:  \n     - **title** — product title  \n     - **url** — product link  \n\n4. **Parse & Split Results**  \n   - The JSON output is decoded and turned into individual product items.\n\n5. **URL Normalization**  \n   - If the product URL is relative, it is automatically converted into a full Amazon URL.\n\n6. **Conditional Check (IF node)**  \n   - Ensures only valid product URLs are stored.  \n   - Helps avoid scraping Amazon navigation links or invalid items.\n\n7. **Insert into Sheet / Data Table**  \n   - Each valid product is saved in:  \n     - title  \n     - url  \n\n8. **Automatic Looping & Rate Management**  \n   - A wait step ensures API rate limits are respected while scraping multiple pages.\n\nThis workflow gives you a complete, reliable Amazon scraper with no browser automation and no manual copy/paste — everything runs through the Olostep API and n8n.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Import this template into your n8n account.  \n2. Add your **Olostep API key**.  \n3. Connect your **Google Sheets** or **Data Table**.  \n4. Deploy the form and start scraping with any Amazon search phrase.\n\n## Requirements  \n- Olostep API key  \n- Google Sheets or Data Table  \n- n8n cloud or self-hosted instance  \n\n## How to customize the workflow  \n- Add more product fields (price, rating, number of reviews, seller name, etc.).  \n- Extend pagination range (1–20 or more pages).  \n- Add filtering logic (e.g., ignore sponsored results).  \n- Send scraped results to Notion, Airtable, or a CRM.  \n- Trigger via Telegram bot instead of a form.  \n\n---\n\n👉 This workflow is perfect for e-commerce research, competitive analysis, or building Amazon product datasets with minimal effort.
