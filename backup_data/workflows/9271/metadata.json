  "description": "## Quick Summary  \nThis workflow connects **Telegram**, **Google Gemini AI**, and **Notion** to make task creation effortless.  \n\nWhenever you send a message to your Telegram bot, Gemini AI reads your message, understands what task you meant, and automatically creates it in your Notion database - complete with the **task name** and **due date**.  \n\nIf you **approve**, the task is added to Notion and you’ll get a confirmation in Telegram.  \nIf you **decline**, it simply replies that ❌ no task was created.  \n\nPerfect for anyone who wants to capture ideas or to-dos directly from Telegram without opening Notion every time.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Use Cases\n\n1. **Quick task capture from Telegram**  \n   - Send a message like “Buy milk 25 May” to your Telegram bot.  \n   - The AI extracts the task name and date, asks you to approve, and creates a Notion task once approved.\n\n2. **Turn reminders into Notion tasks**  \n   - Message: “Pay rent next Monday” → Approve → Task added to Notion with the correct due date.  \n   - Perfect for quickly saving reminders while on the go.\n\n**Tip:** For best results, include clear dates in your messages like `25 May` or `May 25, 2025` so the AI can extract them accurately.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites / Requirements\n\nBefore using this workflow, make sure you have the following ready:\n\n1. **Telegram Bot Setup**  \n   - Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.  \n   - Create a new bot using the `/newbot` command.  \n   - Copy the **Bot Token** — you’ll need it to connect in the **Telegram Trigger** and **Telegram** nodes in n8n.\n\n2. **Google Gemini API Key**  \n   - Sign up for a free Google AI Studio account.  \n   - Create an API key and connect it in your n8n credentials under **Google Gemini**.  \n   - This workflow uses the `models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` model, which works perfectly on the free tier.\n\n3. **Notion Database Setup**  \n   - Create a Notion database for storing tasks.  \n   - It must have:\n     - A **Title** property — set this as the *Task Name* (type: `Title` / text).  \n     - A **Date** property — set this as the *Due Date* (type: `Date`).  \n   - Copy your Notion database ID and connect your **Notion API credentials** in n8n.\n\n4. **Optional Security Note**  \n   - In the Telegram Trigger node, restrict the `chatId` to your own Telegram user ID if this workflow is for personal use.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Guide\n\nYou can easily extend this workflow to capture more details from your Telegram messages using the AI Extract node.  \nHere are a few simple ways to customize it:\n\n1. **Add more extracted fields**  \n   - In the **AI Extract: TaskName & TaskDue** node, open the **Attributes** section.  \n   - Add new fields like:\n     - **Priority** → text (e.g., High, Medium, Low)  \n     - **Duration** → number or text (e.g., 30 mins, 1 hour)  \n     - **Notes** → text (optional extra info)  \n   - The Gemini model will automatically try to extract these from your message.\n\n2. **Example messages you can send**  \n   - “Finish report by Friday — high priority, 2 hours.”  \n   - “Workout tomorrow evening — medium priority.”\n\n3. **Map extra fields to Notion**  \n   - In the **Notion: Create Task (Page)** node, scroll to the **Properties** section.  \n   - Add matching Notion properties for each new field (e.g., Priority, Duration).  \n   - Map the AI outputs (like `output.Priority`) to their respective fields.\n\n4. **Send confirmation with extra data**  \n   - In the **Send and Wait for Response (Approve/Decline)** node, include the new extracted details in the Telegram message before approval.  \n   - Example confirmation message:\n     ```\n     Task: {{ $json.output.TaskName }}\n     Due: {{ $json.output.TaskDue }}\n     Priority: {{ $json.output.Priority }}\n     Duration: {{ $json.output.Duration }}\n     ```\n\nBy doing this, you can build a smarter task capture system that includes priority, time estimation, and other useful details, all directly from your Telegram chat.\n",
