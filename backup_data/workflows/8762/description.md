## What it does

This workflow watches a Google Sheet for new YouTube video links. For each new video, it fetches the transcript and top comments using **Dumpling AI**, then sends that data along with the original search topic to **GPT-4o**.

GPT-4o returns 3–5 new content ideas based on:
- What was discussed in the video
- What people are searching for
- What viewers are saying in the comments

Each idea is saved to another Google Sheet and also sent to your email.

## How it works

1. **Trigger**: Watches for new rows in the "YouTube Finds" sheet  
2. **Transcript & Comments**: Sends video URL to Dumpling AI to fetch transcript and comments  
3. **Merge & Format**: Cleans and aggregates comments into one input  
4. **AI Prompting**: GPT-4o analyzes transcript, topic, and comments to suggest ideas  
5. **Output**: Splits and saves the results to a "YouTube Content Idea" sheet and emails them
