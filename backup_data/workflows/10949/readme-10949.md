## 🛠 Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Import Workflow**: Copy the JSON → n8n → Workflows → + Add → Import from JSON
2. **Configure [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) API**:
   - Endpoint: `https://api.scrape.do/`
   - Parameter: `token=YOUR_SCRAPEDO_TOKEN`
   - Add `render=true` for JavaScript-heavy booking sites
   - Add `country=US` (or target country) for localized results
3. **Configure Google Sheets**:
   - Create a sheet with two tabs: **Search Parameters** (input), **Price Comparison** (output)
   - Set up Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials in n8n
   - Replace placeholders: `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` and `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIAL_ID`
4. **Configure Platform URLs**:
   - Update base URLs for Booking.com, Hotels.com, Expedia in HTTP Request nodes
   - Customize search parameters based on platform URL structure
5. **Run & Test**:
   - Add test data in Search Parameters tab
   - Execute workflow → Check results in Price Comparison tab

## 🧰 How to Customize

- **Add more platforms**: Include Agoda, Trivago, or direct hotel websites by adding new HTTP Request nodes
- **Price alerts**: Add conditional logic to send email/Slack notification when price drops below threshold
- **Historical tracking**: Store daily snapshots to track price trends over time
- **Filtering**: Add filters for amenities (pool, gym, parking) or star ratings
- **Batch Size**: Adjust "Process Hotels in Batches" based on API rate limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Insert Wait nodes (20–30 seconds) between platform requests
- **Currency conversion**: Add currency API integration for multi-currency comparison
- **Scheduling**: Add Schedule Trigger to run automatically (daily/weekly)

## 📊 Use Cases

- **Travel Planning**: Find the best hotel deals for upcoming trips
- **Price Monitoring**: Track price changes for specific hotels over time
- **Agency Operations**: Automate price research for client bookings
- **Market Analysis**: Monitor competitor pricing in hospitality market
- **Deal Alerts**: Get notified when prices drop below target threshold
- **Budget Planning**: Compare costs across multiple destinations

## 📈 Performance & Limits

- **Single Hotel (3 platforms)**: ~30–45 seconds (depends on [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) response)
- **Batch of 10 hotels**: 8–12 minutes typical
- **Large Sets (50+ hotels)**: 45–90 minutes depending on API credits & batching
- **API Calls**: 3 [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) requests per hotel (one per platform)
- **Reliability**: 90%+ extraction success, 95%+ price accuracy

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- **API error** → Check `YOUR_SCRAPEDO_TOKEN` and API credits on [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) dashboard
- **No hotels loaded** → Verify Google Sheet ID & tab name = **Search Parameters**
- **Permission denied** → Re-authenticate Google Sheets OAuth2 in n8n
- **Empty prices** → Check if [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) rendered JavaScript (`render=true`)
- **Parsing errors** → Booking sites change HTML structure; update CSS selectors in Extract nodes
- **Workflow timeout** → Reduce batch size or add more Wait nodes between requests
- **Wrong currency** → Add `country` parameter to [Scrape.do](https://scrape.do/) request for localized pricing
