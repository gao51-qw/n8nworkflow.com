# Odoo CRM MCP Server Workflow

## 📖 Overview

This workflow connects an **AI Agent** with **Odoo CRM** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.  
It allows users to manage CRM data in Odoo through natural language chat commands.  
The assistant interprets the user’s request, selects the appropriate Odoo action, and executes it seamlessly.  

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Contacts Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve contacts.  
- **Opportunities Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve opportunities.  
- **Notes Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve notes.  
- **Conversational AI Agent**: Understands natural language and maps requests to Odoo actions.  
- **Model Used**: OpenAI Chat Model.  

This makes it easy for end-users to interact with Odoo CRM without needing technical commands—just plain language instructions.

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the workflow:

### 1. Prerequisites
- An **Odoo instance** configured with CRM enabled.  
- An **n8n** or **automation platform** account where MCP workflows are supported.  
- An **OpenAI API key** with access to GPT models.  
- MCP Server installed and running.  

### 2. Import the Workflow
1. Download the provided workflow JSON file.  
2. In your automation platform (n8n, Langflow, or other MCP-enabled tool), choose **Import Workflow**.  
3. Select the JSON file and confirm.  

### 3. Configure MCP Server
1. Go to your **MCP Server Trigger node** in the workflow.  
2. Configure it to connect with your Odoo instance.  
   - Set API endpoint.  
   - Provide **authentication credentials** (API key).  
3. Test the connection to ensure the MCP server can reach Odoo.  

### 4. Configure the OpenAI Model
1. Select the **OpenAI Chat Model node** in the workflow.  
2. Enter your **OpenAI API Key**.  
3. Choose the model (e.g., `gpt-5` or `gpt-5-mini`).  

### 5. AI Agent Setup
- The **AI Agent node** links the Chat Model, Memory, and MCP Client.  
- Ensure the **MCP Client** is mapped to the correct Odoo tools (Contacts, Opportunities, Notes).  
- The **System Prompt** defines assistant behavior—use the tailored system prompt provided earlier.  

### 6. Activate and Test

2. Open chat and type:  
   - "Create a contact named *John Doe* with email john@example.com."  
   - "Show me all opportunities."  
   - "Add a note to *John Doe* saying 'Follow-up scheduled for Friday'."  
3. Verify the results in your Odoo CRM.
