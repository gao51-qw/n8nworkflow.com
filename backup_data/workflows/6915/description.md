## 🟢 Section 1: Trigger & Director Setup

🔗 **Nodes:**

* **When chat message received (Trigger)** → Starts the workflow whenever you send a request (e.g., “Plan a TikTok campaign for my product launch”).
* **Social Media Director Agent** (connected to **OpenAI O3 model**) → Acts as the strategist.
* **Think Tool** → Helps the Director “reason” before delegating.

💡 **Beginner takeaway:**
This section makes your workflow interactive. You send a request → the Director decides the best approach → then it assigns tasks.

📈 **Advantage:**
Instead of manually planning content per platform, you only send **one command**, and the AI Director handles the strategy.
