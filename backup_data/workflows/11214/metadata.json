  "description": "Automatically analyze your full sports performance evolution using your Strava activities, enriched with AI insights and delivered directly to your email — all powered by your own n8n instance.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Why this workflow?\n\nStop manually reviewing your training history.\nThis workflow automates the entire analysis: collecting activities, filtering by date range, comparing progress, generating a structured AI report, storing it, and emailing it to you.\n\n* **Battle-tested:** refined across multiple Strava accounts to ensure strong error handling and stable performance.\n* **Fully documented:** each block is cleanly structured; logic is easy to follow.\n* **Safe & robust:** handles missing fields, invalid dates, empty ranges, and malformed inputs.\n* **Flexible:** change the analysis period (week/month/year/total), language, and recipient in one single node (OPTIONS).\n* **Zero manual work:** reports arrive automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 What does the workflow do?\n\n* Reads your entire Strava activity dataset from Google Sheets.\n* Filters activities by your chosen range (last week, last month, last year, or all time).\n* Formats each activity as “Activity 1, Activity 2, …” (from newest to oldest).\n* Sends the full historical dataset + the previous AI report (if available) to GPT-5-nano.\n* Generates a complete performance report with six sections:\n\n  * Evolution\n  * Best improvements\n  * Setbacks\n  * Performance patterns\n  * Current state\n  * Recommendations\n* Saves the new report in a separate Google Sheet for long-term tracking.\n* Converts the AI output into clean, professional Markdown → HTML.\n* Sends you a styled email with the final report.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Technologies & APIs Used\n\n* **n8n** (cloud or self-hosted)\n* **OpenAI** (GPT-5-nano for analysis)\n* **Google Sheets API** (activity log + report archive)\n* **Gmail/SMTP** (email delivery)\n* **Strava data imported into Sheets** (activity database)\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Who is this for?\n\n* Athletes who want automated tracking of their evolution.\n* Coaches who need structured, periodic reports.\n* Data-driven users who love learning from their training history.\n* Anyone who wants AI-powered insights without subscriptions or external dashboards.\n* n8n fans exploring advanced automations.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Problems Solved\n\n* No more manual comparison of activities.\n* Automatic detection of improvements and regressions.\n* A complete evolution report is always stored and searchable.\n* Every analysis is emailed in clean, easy-to-read formatting.\n* Eliminates the need for external reporting tools.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Quick Setup\n\n1. Import the `.json` workflow into your n8n.\n2. Add your credentials:\n\n   * OpenAI API key\n   * Google Sheets\n   * Email (SMTP or Gmail)\n3. Make sure your Strava activities are synced into the main Sheet.\n4. Adjust name, email, language, and range in **OPTIONS**.\n5. Run manually or let the scheduler handle it automatically.\n6. Also keep in mind that each generated report has an approximate cost of **$0.01** in OpenAI API usage.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 What’s included?\n\n* n8n workflow file (`.json`)\n* Internal documentation inside the flow\n* Automatic report archiving\n* Basic support by email\n* Professional AI-generated performance reports sent directly to you\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the price of this workflow may increase in future updates, although all updates will remain free for existing users. \n",
