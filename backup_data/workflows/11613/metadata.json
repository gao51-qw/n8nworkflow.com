  "description": "This template demonstrates how to combine **n8n**, **OpenAI agents**, and the new **Xano Node** to build an intelligent support-ticket routing system — without writing a single API call.\n\nStart your Xano journey with the downloadable snippet [here!](https://www.xano.com/snippet/SABJTqr-)\n\nWhen a ticket arrives, the workflow:\n\n1. **Receives the ticket** via Webhook\n2. **Classifies the issue** using an n8n Agent with an OpenAI model\n3. **Searches Xano** to check whether the user already exists\n4. **Creates or updates records** using the native Xano Node (no headers or manual HTTP setup)\n5. **Triggers backend logic in Xano**, where escalation rules and agent workflows process the ticket\n6. **Returns a structured response** to n8n for further routing (Slack, CRM, inbox, etc.)\n\nThis template highlights how Xano can act as your backend intelligence layer while n8n orchestrates everything else — making it easy to automate support operations, apply escalation policies, and unify your data across tools.\n\nUse this as a foundation to build more advanced automation: customer enrichment, billing checks, account risk detection, SLA enforcement, and more.\n\nHappy building! 🚀",
