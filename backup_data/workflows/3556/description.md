*Note: This workflow uses the Exchange rate API and requires a valid API key.*

### Context
I’m [Samir Saci](https://samirsaci.com), a **Supply Chain Data Scientist** who builds automations to streamline operations, reduce manual tasks, and boost decision-making through real-time data.

In this workflow, I automated the task of **fetching live currency exchange rates**, updating a **Google Sheet** with the latest values, and **archiving historical records** — all without writing any code.

### Who is this template for?
This template is perfect for:
- **Finance teams** tracking multi-currency cashflows
- **Analysts** building dashboards or models requiring updated FX data
- **Anyone working with spreadsheets** who needs up-to-date exchange rates

It updates:
- A live sheet with the latest USD-based exchange rates
- An archive tab to track historical changes over time

### How does it work?
This workflow runs in N8N and performs the following steps:

1. 🌐 **Calls the ExchangeRate API** to get the latest rates based on USD
2. 🧠 **Extracts and formats key fields**: base currency, timestamp, and conversion values
3. 📊 **Updates a main Google Sheet** with the latest data (using upsert logic)
4. 🗂️ **Appends all rates** to a second Google Sheet tab for historical tracking

You can schedule this workflow to run daily, hourly, or on-demand.

### What do I need to start?
You don’t need to write a single line of code.
#### Prerequisites:
- A **Google Sheet** with two tabs: `Rate Sheet` and `Archives` *(Link of the publicly available example in the template)*
- A **valid Exchangerate API key**
- **Google Sheets API** connected via OAuth2

### Next Steps
Use the sticky notes in the workflow to understand how to:
- Add your Exchangerate API key
- Map the fields to match your Google Sheet layout
- Schedule the run frequency using the **Cron node**
- Optionally add Slack or email alerts if the base rate changes
