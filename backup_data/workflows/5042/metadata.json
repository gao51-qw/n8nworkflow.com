  "description": "## 🔍 How it works  \nThis workflow turns WhatsApp into a smart email command center using AI.\n\nUsers can speak or type instructions like:  \n- \"Send a follow-up to Claire”\n- \"Write a draft email to Claire to confirm tomorrow’s meeting at 5 PM”\n- \"What is the name of Claire's firm?”\n\nThe agent transcribes voice notes, extracts intent with GPT, interacts with Gmail (send, draft, search), and replies with a confirmation via WhatsApp — either as text or a voice message.\n\n## ⚙️ Key Modules Used\n- WhatsApp Business Webhook (Meta)\n- OpenAI Whisper (voice transcription)\n- GPT (intent + content generation)\n- Gmail (search, draft, send)\n- Airtable (contact lookup + memory logging)\n\n## 🧠 Memory Layer (Optional)\nThe agent logs key fields in Airtable:\n- Recipient email\n- Company / job title\nAnd more...\nThis creates a lightweight \"gut memory” so the agent feels context-aware.\n\n## 🗺️ Setup Steps\n1. Connect WhatsApp Business API (via Meta Developer Console)\n2. Add OpenAI and Gmail credentials in n8n\n3. Link your Airtable base for contacts and logging\n\n## 🧩 Best Use Cases\n- Hands-free email reply while commuting\n- Fast Gmail access for busy consultants / solopreneurs\n- Custom business agents for service-based professionals\n\n## ⏱️ Estimated Setup Time\n30–60 minutes\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n- WhatsApp Business Cloud access\n- OpenAI API Key\n- Gmail or Google Workspace\n- Airtable account (free plan OK)\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted with HTTPS)",
