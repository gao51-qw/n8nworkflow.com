  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## Build Citation Networks from Research Papers\n\nAutomatically build and visualize citation networks by fetching papers and their references. Discover influential works and research trends in any field.\n\n### Workflow Features:\n- Start with seed papers (DOIs, PubMed IDs, etc.)\n- Fetch cited and citing papers recursively\n- Build network graph data\n- Export to visualization tools (Gephi, Cytoscape)\n- Identify key papers and research clusters\n\n### Process Flow:\n1. **Input**: Seed paper identifiers\n2. **Fetch Papers**: Get paper details and references\n3. **Expand Network**: Fetch cited papers (configurable depth)\n4. **Build Graph**: Create nodes and edges\n5. **Analyze**: Calculate metrics (centrality, clusters)\n6. **Export**: Generate visualization-ready data\n\n### Applications:\n- Research trend analysis\n- Finding seminal papers in a field\n- Grant proposal background research",
