# How it works
This template takes a YouTube video ID and identifies potentially engaging moments based on the intensity of specific timestamps 👇

Ideal for vloggers and YouTube content creators, it serves as a foundation for various automations to streamline content calendars or highlight popular moments in your videos. You can leverage it for:

- Automatic processes to analyze YouTube videos and create sizzle reels or clips for social media, particularly effective for microcontent strategies like those endorsed by Gary Vee.
- Instant alerts via Slack, Telegram, Email, or WhatsApp when significant moments occur in your videos.
- Utilizing transcripts of these moments with AI to refine content ideas or brainstorm chatbots in your editorial workflow.


### Example response from the Workflow-as-an-API 

A GET request to `{your instance URL}/webhook/youtube-engaging-moments-extractor?ytID=IZsQqarWXtYy` returns 👇

The workflow generates multiple moments; the screenshot above shows a truncated version.

Not all videos contain timestamp intensity data, the workflow handles this case as well 👇

# How to use
1. Import the template into your n8n workspace or self-hosted instance, then activate the workflow.
2. Open the Webhook trigger node and copy the Production URL.
3. In a web browser or any tool capable of consuming HTTP Requests (e.g., native code, Bubble app, n8n workflow, another automation tool, Postman, etc.), pass along the URL parameter `?ytID={youtube video ID}` when invoking the API endpoint.

Your URL should resemble something like `https://acme.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/youtube-engaging-moments-extractor?ytID=IZsQqarWXtYy`.


**Keep in mind**
This workflow relies on an unofficial YouTube API graciously hosted for free by the folks at lemnoslife.com. It's not recommended for high-volume production usecases.
