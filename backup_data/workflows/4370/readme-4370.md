# Auto meeting summarizer with Google Drive, OpenAI Whisper & GPT-4 to Sheets

> # 🎤 Audio-to-Insights: Auto Meeting Summarizer

Transform your meeting recordings into actionable insights automatically. This powerful n8n workflow monitors your Google Drive for new audio files, transcribes them using OpenAI's Whisper, generates intelligent summaries with ChatGPT, and logs everything in Google Sheets - all without lifting a finger.

## 🔄 How It Works

This workflow operates as a seamless 6-step automation pipeline:

**Step 1: Smart Detection**
The workflow continuously monitors a designated Google Drive folder (polls every minute) for newly uploaded audio files.

**Step 2: Secure Download**
When a new audio file is detected, the system automatically downloads it from Google Drive for processing.

**Step 3: AI Transcription**
OpenAI's Whisper technology converts your audio recording into accurate text transcription, supporting multiple audio formats.

**Step 4: Intelligent Summarization**
ChatGPT processes the transcript using a specialized prompt that extracts:
- Key discussion points and decisions
- Action items with assigned persons and deadlines
- Priority levels and follow-up tasks
- Clean, professional formatting

**Step 5: Timestamp Generation**
The system automatically adds the current date and formats it consistently for tracking purposes.

**Step 6: Automated Logging**
The final summary is appended to your Google Sheets document with the date, creating a searchable archive of all meeting insights.
