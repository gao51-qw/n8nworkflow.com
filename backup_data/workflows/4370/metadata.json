  "description": "# 🎤 Audio-to-Insights: Auto Meeting Summarizer\n\nTransform your meeting recordings into actionable insights automatically. This powerful n8n workflow monitors your Google Drive for new audio files, transcribes them using OpenAI's Whisper, generates intelligent summaries with ChatGPT, and logs everything in Google Sheets - all without lifting a finger.\n\n## 🔄 How It Works\n\nThis workflow operates as a seamless 6-step automation pipeline:\n\n**Step 1: Smart Detection**\nThe workflow continuously monitors a designated Google Drive folder (polls every minute) for newly uploaded audio files.\n\n**Step 2: Secure Download**\nWhen a new audio file is detected, the system automatically downloads it from Google Drive for processing.\n\n**Step 3: AI Transcription**\nOpenAI's Whisper technology converts your audio recording into accurate text transcription, supporting multiple audio formats.\n\n**Step 4: Intelligent Summarization**\nChatGPT processes the transcript using a specialized prompt that extracts:\n- Key discussion points and decisions\n- Action items with assigned persons and deadlines\n- Priority levels and follow-up tasks\n- Clean, professional formatting\n\n**Step 5: Timestamp Generation**\nThe system automatically adds the current date and formats it consistently for tracking purposes.\n\n**Step 6: Automated Logging**\nThe final summary is appended to your Google Sheets document with the date, creating a searchable archive of all meeting insights.\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Steps\n\n### Prerequisites\nBefore setting up the workflow, ensure you have:\n- Active Google Drive account\n- OpenAI API key with credits\n- Google Sheets access\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n\n### Configuration Steps\n\n**1.
