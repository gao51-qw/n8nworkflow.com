## Description 
Automate dress image handling end-to-end: search files, download them, upload to Cloudinary, invoke Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o), parse structured output, and append rows to a sheet. Gain a repeatable, low-touch process for product media and metadata logging. ✨

## What This Template Does 
- Searches files and folders from your connected storage. 🔎
- Loops over each item to process them individually. 🔁
- Downloads each file for processing. ⬇
- Uploads image frames to Cloudinary via REST POST. ☁️
- Sends content to Azure OpenAI Chat Model and parses structured output. 🤖
- Appends rows to a sheet (two destinations supported) for logging. 📄
- Merges inputs where needed to streamline final outputs. 🔗

## Key Benefits 
- Saves time by automating multi-step media handling. ⏱
- Ensures consistent uploads and logs for every file. ✅
- Adds AI-powered processing via Azure OpenAI when needed. 🧠
- Keeps records up to date with automatic sheet appends. 📈
