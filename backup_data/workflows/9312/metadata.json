  "description": "## Description \nAutomate dress image handling end-to-end: search files, download them, upload to Cloudinary, invoke Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o), parse structured output, and append rows to a sheet. Gain a repeatable, low-touch process for product media and metadata logging. ✨\n\n## What This Template Does \n- Searches files and folders from your connected storage. 🔎\n- Loops over each item to process them individually. 🔁\n- Downloads each file for processing. ⬇\n- Uploads image frames to Cloudinary via REST POST. ☁️\n- Sends content to Azure OpenAI Chat Model and parses structured output. 🤖\n- Appends rows to a sheet (two destinations supported) for logging. 📄\n- Merges inputs where needed to streamline final outputs. 🔗\n\n## Key Benefits \n- Saves time by automating multi-step media handling. ⏱\n- Ensures consistent uploads and logs for every file. ✅\n- Adds AI-powered processing via Azure OpenAI when needed. 🧠\n- Keeps records up to date with automatic sheet appends. 📈\n- Modular flow that’s easy to adapt to your source/destination. 🧩\n\n## Features \n- File and folder search node for flexible intake. 📂\n- Item-by-item loop for reliable, scalable processing. 🔁\n- Cloudinary image upload via HTTP POST endpoint. ☁\n- Azure OpenAI Chat Model invocation. 🤖\n- Structured Output Parser for clean, machine-readable results. 🧾\n- Dual sheet append capability for separate logs. ➕\n\n## Requirements \n- An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted). 🧭\n- Cloudinary account with an accessible upload endpoint. ☁️\n- Azure OpenAI access with a deployed Chat Model (GPT-4o). 🔐\n- A connected spreadsheet integration in n8n for appending rows. 📄\n- Access to your file storage where the search and download occur. 📂\n\n## Target Audience \n- E-commerce and catalog teams managing product media. 🛍️\n- Ops teams standardizing uploads and record-keeping. 🧰\n- No-code/low-code builders organizing image pipelines. 🧱\n- Agencies maintaining client product image workflows. 🏷️\n\n## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n- Connect your file storage credential for Search/Download nodes. 🔌\n- Configure Cloudinary upload endpoint and credentials in n8n. ☁️\n- Add Azure OpenAI credentials and set your GPT-4o deployment details. 🤖\n- Connect your sheet credential(s) and select target sheet(s). 📄\n- Import the workflow, assign credentials to each node, and replace placeholders. ✅\n- Run once to test; then enable scheduling or triggers as needed. 🚀",
