# Generate AI Viral Videos with VEO3 and Auto-Publish to TikTok

### Who is this for?
This workflow is for **content creators, marketers, and social media managers** who want to consistently produce **viral-style short videos** and publish them automatically to TikTok — without manual editing or uploading.

### What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case
Creating short-form video content that stands out takes time: ideation, scriptwriting, video generation, and publishing. This workflow automates the **entire pipeline** — from idea generation to TikTok upload — enabling you to scale your content strategy and focus on creativity rather than repetitive tasks.

### What this workflow does
- **Generates viral video ideas** daily using GPT-5  
- **Creates structured prompts** for before/after transformation videos  
- **Renders cinematic vertical videos** with VEO3 (9:16 format)  
- **Saves ideas and metadata** into Google Sheets for tracking  
- **Uploads videos automatically to TikTok** via Blotato integration  
- **Updates status in Google Sheets** once the video is live  

The result: a fully automated daily viral video publishing system.

### Setup
1. **Google Sheets**  
   - Connect your Google Sheets account.  
   - Create a sheet with columns for idea, caption, environment, sound, production, and final_output.  
2. **OpenAI**  
   - Add your OpenAI API credentials (for GPT-5 mini / GPT-4.1 mini).  
3. **VEO3 (Kie API)**  
   - Set up your API key in the HTTP Request node (`Generate Video with VEO3`).  
4. **Blotato**  
   - Connect your Blotato account for TikTok publishing.  
5. **Schedule Trigger**  
   - Adjust the `Start Daily Content Generation` node to fit your preferred posting frequency.  

### How to customize this workflow to your needs
- **Platforms**: Extend publishing to YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels by duplicating the TikTok step.  
- **Frequency**: Change the Schedule Trigger to post multiple times per day or only a few times per week.  
- **Creative Style**: Modify the system prompts to align with your brand’s style (cinematic, minimalist, neon, etc.).  
- **Tracking**: Enhance the Google Sheets logging with engagement metrics by pulling TikTok analytics via Blotato.
