*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically tracks regional sentiment across social media and news outlets, giving you a real-time pulse on how people in a specific area feel about your brand or topic.

## Overview

The automation queries Twitter, Reddit, and major news APIs filtered by geolocation. Bright Data handles location-specific scraping where APIs are limited. OpenAI performs sentiment and keyword extraction, aggregating scores into a daily report stored in Google Sheets and visualized in Data Studio.

- **Bright Data** – Collects geo-targeted data beyond API limits
- **OpenAI** – Runs sentiment analysis and topic modeling
