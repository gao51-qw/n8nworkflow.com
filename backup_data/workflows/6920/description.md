## What this template does
Sends you an email (via Gmail) whenever any workflow that references this one **fails**. The message includes the workflow name/ID, execution URL, last node executed, and the error message.

## Why it’s useful
Centralizes error notifications so you notice failures immediately and can jump straight to the failed execution.

## Prerequisites
- A Gmail account connected through n8n’s **Gmail** node credentials.
- This workflow set as the **Error Workflow** inside the workflows you want to monitor.

## How it works
1. **Error Trigger** starts this workflow whenever a linked workflow fails.  
2. **Gmail (Send → Message)** composes and sends an email using details from the Error Trigger.

## Notes
- Error workflows **don’t need to be activated** to work.  
- You can’t test them by running manually—errors must occur in an **automatically** run workflow (cron, webhook, etc.).
