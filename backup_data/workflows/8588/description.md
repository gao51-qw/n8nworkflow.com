Overview

This workflow automates the end-to-end delivery of digital products after a successful Stripe checkout. It eliminates manual fulfillment, keeps a structured sales log in Notion, and optionally notifies you in Telegram.

It’s designed for template sellers, coaches, course creators, and micro-SaaS owners who want to professionalize their delivery process without custom code.
