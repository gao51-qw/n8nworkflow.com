# Automate digital product delivery & sales tracking with Stripe, Email, Notion & Telegram

> Overview

This workflow automates the end-to-end delivery of digital products after a successful Stripe checkout. It eliminates manual fulfillment, keeps a structured sales log in Notion, and optionally notifies you in Telegram.

It’s designed for template sellers, coaches, course creators, and micro-SaaS owners who want to professionalize their delivery process without custom code.

IF Node – Check Product

Evaluates line_items.data[0].description from Stripe response.
