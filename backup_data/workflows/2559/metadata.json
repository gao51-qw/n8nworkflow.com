  "description": "### Overview  \n- This workflow aims to provide data visualization capabilities to a native SQL Agent.  \n- Together, they can help foster data analysis and data visualization within a team.  \n- It uses the native SQL Agent that works well and adds visualization capabilities thanks to OpenAI’s Structured Output and Quickchart.io.  \n\n### How it works  \n1. Information Extraction:  \n   - The Information Extractor identifies and extracts the user's question.  \n   - If the question includes a visualization aspect, the SQL Agent alone may not respond accurately.  \n\n2. SQL Querying:  \n   - It leverages a regular SQL Agent: it connects to a database, queries it, and translates the response into a human-readable format.  \n\n3. Chart Decision:  \n   - The Text Classifier determines whether the user would benefit from a chart to support the SQL Agent's response.  \n\n4. Chart Generation:  \n   - If a chart is needed, the sub-workflow dynamically generates a chart and appends it to the SQL Agent’s response.  \n   - If not, the SQL Agent’s response is output as is.  \n\n5. Calling OpenAI for Chart Definition:  \n   - The sub-workflow calls OpenAI via the HTTP Request node to retrieve a chart definition.  \n\n6. Building and Returning the Chart:  \n   - In the \"Set Response\" node, the chart definition is appended to a Quickchart.io URL, generating the final chart image.  \n   - The AI Agent returns the response along with the chart.  \n\n### How to use it  \n- Use an existing database or create a new one.  \n- For example, I've used [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/coffee-sales/versions/15?resource=download) and uploaded it to a Supabase DB.  \n- Add the PostgreSQL or MySQL credentials.  \n- Alternatively, you can use SQLite binary files (check [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2292-talk-to-your-sqlite-database-with-a-langchain-ai-agent/)).  \n- Activate the workflow.  \n- Start chatting with the AI SQL Agent.  \n- If the Text Classifier determines a chart would be useful, it will generate one in addition to the SQL Agent's response.  \n\n### Notes  \n- The full Quickchart.io specifications have not been fully integrated, so there may be some glitches (e.g., radar graphs may not display properly due to size limitations).
