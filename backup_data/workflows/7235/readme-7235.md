> # Dynamic Search Interface with Elasticsearch and Automated Report Generation

## 🎯 What this workflow does

This template creates a comprehensive data search and reporting system that allows users to query large datasets through an intuitive web form interface. The system performs real-time searches against Elasticsearch, processes results, and automatically generates structured reports in multiple formats for data analysis and business intelligence.

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 Interactive web form for dynamic data querying
- ⚡ Real-time Elasticsearch data retrieval with complex filtering
- 📊 Auto-generated reports (Text & CSV formats) with custom formatting
- 💾 Automatic file storage system for data persistence
- 🎯 Configurable search parameters (amounts, time ranges, entity filters)
- 🔧 Scalable architecture for handling large datasets

## 🛠️ Setup requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Elasticsearch cluster** running on `https://localhost:9220`
- **Transaction dataset** indexed in `bank_transactions` index
- **Sample dataset**: Download from [Bank Transaction Dataset](https://github.com/dataminexcode/n8n-workflow/blob/main/Dynamic%20Search%20Interface%20with%20Elasticsearch%20and%20Automated%20Report%20Generation/data)
- **File system access** to `/tmp/` directory for report storage
- **HTTP Basic Authentication** credentials for Elasticsearch

### Required Elasticsearch Index Structure
This template uses the **Bank Transaction Dataset** from GitHub: https://github.com/dataminexcode/n8n-workflow/blob/main/Dynamic%20Search%20Interface%20with%20Elasticsearch%20and%20Automated%20Report%20Generation/data

You can use this python script for importing the csv file into elasticsearch: [Python script for importing data](https://github.com/dataminexcode/n8n-workflow/blob/main/Dynamic%20Search%20Interface%20with%20Elasticsearch%20and%20Automated%20Report%20Generation/python_scripts/import_to_elasticsearch.py)

Your `bank_transactions` index should contain documents with these fields:
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN_123456789",
  "customer_id": "CUST_000001", 
  "amount": 5000,
  "merchant_category": "grocery_net",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T15:30:00Z"
}
```

**Dataset Info**: This dataset contains realistic financial transaction data perfect for testing search algorithms and report generation, with over 1 million transaction records including various transaction patterns and data types.

### Credentials Setup
1. Create HTTP Basic Auth credentials in n8n
2. Configure with your Elasticsearch username/password
3. Assign to the "Search Elasticsearch" node

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Form Customization
- **Webhook Path**: Update the webhook ID if needed
- **Form Fields**: Modify amounts, time ranges, or add new filters
- **Validation**: Adjust required fields based on your needs

### 2. Elasticsearch Configuration
- **URL**: Change `localhost:9220` to your ES cluster endpoint
- **Index Name**: Update `bank_transactions` to your index name
- **Query Logic**: Modify search criteria in "Build Search Query" node
- **Result Limit**: Adjust the `size: 100` parameter for more/fewer results

### 3. File Storage
- **Directory**: Change `/tmp/` to your preferred storage location
- **Filename Pattern**: Modify `fraud_report_YYYY-MM-DD.{ext}` format
- **Permissions**: Ensure n8n has write access to the target directory

### 4. Report Formatting
- **CSV Headers**: Customize column names in the Format Report node
- **Text Layout**: Modify the report template for your organization
- **Data Fields**: Add/remove transaction fields as needed
