This workflow automatically processes [Fireflies.ai](https://app.fireflies.ai/login?referralCode=01K0V2Z1QHY76ZGY9450251C99) **meeting recap emails**, extracts the meeting transcript, generates a structured summary email, and sends it to a designated recipient.

### **How It Works**

1. **Trigger**  
   The workflow starts with a Gmail Trigger that checks for new emails with the subject `"Your meeting recap"` from `fred@fireflies.ai` every hour.

2. **Email Processing**  
   When a matching email is found, the workflow retrieves the full email content and extracts the meeting recap URL using an **Information Extractor** node powered by OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini.

3. **Meeting ID Extraction**  
   A **Code Node** extracts the meeting ID from the Fireflies URL (between `::` and `?`) for use in the next step.

4. **Transcript Fetching**  
   The meeting ID is sent to the **Fireflies Node**, which retrieves the full transcript and summary data (short summary, short overview, and full overview).

5. **AI-Powered Email Generation**  
   The meeting summary data is passed to a **Google Gemini** node, which generates a complete meeting summary email with a subject line and body in JSON format.

6. **Data Formatting**  
   The raw JSON output is parsed in a **Code Node**, and the email body is converted from Markdown to HTML using the **Markdown Node**.

7. **Email Delivery**  
   Finally, the email is sent via Gmail with the AI-generated subject and HTML body.

### **Set Up Steps**

1. **Configure Credentials**  
   - Set up Gmail OAuth2 credentials for email triggering and sending.

3. **Customize Output Email**  
   Modify the recipient email in the **Send email** node to the desired address.

4. **Optional: Modify AI Prompts**  
   Adjust the system prompts in the **Information Extractor** and **Email Agent** nodes to change extraction behavior or email tone.

5. **Activate Workflow**  
   Ensure the workflow is set to **Active** in n8n, and test it by sending a sample Fireflies recap email to your connected Gmail account.
