# 🔐 Email Encryption Masterclass
*Professional-Grade AES-256 Data Protection for n8n*

## How It Works

This comprehensive workflow demonstrates enterprise-level email encryption using industry-standard AES-256-CBC encryption. Perfect for organizations handling sensitive customer data who need to comply with GDPR, HIPAA, or other data protection regulations.

**The workflow processes data in three secure stages:**

1. **Sample Data Generation** - Creates test user records with emails for demonstration
2. **Email Encryption** - Applies AES-256-CBC encryption with unique initialization vectors (IVs) for each record
3. **Verification System** - Decrypts and validates the encrypted data to ensure integrity

Each email address is encrypted with a randomly generated IV, making every encryption unique even for identical email addresses. The system includes comprehensive error handling and provides detailed processing status for audit trails.

## Key Features

✅ **Military-Grade Security**: AES-256-CBC encryption with unique IVs
✅ **Compliance Ready**: Built for GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX requirements  
✅ **Batch Processing**: Handles large datasets efficiently
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management with detailed logging
✅ **Verification System**: Built-in decryption validation
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete processing timestamps and status tracking
✅ **Production Ready**: Includes security best practices and key management guidance

## Setup Steps

### 1. Import the Workflow
- Download the JSON file
- In n8n, go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
- Select the downloaded JSON file
- Click **Import**

### 2. Configure Security Settings
- Open the **Encrypt Emails** node
- Replace the default secret key with your own 32-character secure key:
  ```javascript
  const secret = 'your_32_character_secret_key_here!';
  ```
- **Important**: In production, use environment variables for the secret key

### 3. Set Up Sample Data (Optional)
- The workflow includes sample user data for testing
- Replace with your actual data source (database, API, CSV, etc.)
- Ensure your data has an `email` field

### 4. Test the Workflow
- Click **Execute workflow** to run the complete process
- Review the encrypted results in each node
- Verify that emails are properly encrypted and can be decrypted

### 5. Production Deployment
- **Remove** the `originalEmail` field from output (line 45 in Encrypt Emails node)
- Store your secret key in environment variables
- Set up proper key rotation schedule
- Configure monitoring and alerting for failed encryptions

## Security Best Practices Included

🔒 **Unique IVs**: Every encryption uses a fresh random initialization vector
🔒 **Proper Key Length**: Enforces 32-byte keys for AES-256
🔒 **Error Isolation**: Failed encryptions don't break the entire batch
🔒 **No Key Exposure**: Secret keys are never logged or stored in output
🔒 **Verification Loop**: Ensures encrypted data can be successfully decrypted

## Use Cases

- **Customer Data Protection**: Encrypt email addresses in CRM systems
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, SOX data protection mandates
- **Data Warehouse Security**: Protect PII in analytics databases
- **Secure Data Transfer**: Encrypt sensitive data before API transmission
- **Audit Preparation**: Demonstrate proper data protection controls
