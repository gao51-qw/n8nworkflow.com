  "description": "### ## | N8N Workflow | AI-Powered Twitter Automation with Content Generation and Engagement 🚀\n\n*This n8n template automates Twitter (X) activity — from generating tweet content with AI to engaging with posts and even sending DMs — all powered by Google Gemini or OpenRouter AI.*\n\n*It’s designed for creators, marketers, brands, and agencies who want to automate social media presence with authentic, on-brand AI content and engagement.*\n\n## How It Works\n\n- The workflow begins with a form trigger, where users input their topic, tone, and action type (Tweet, Engage, or DM).\n- Those inputs are passed into Workflow Configuration, which sets key parameters like max tweet length and model URLs.\nDepending on your chosen action:\n- Post Tweet: AI generates a tweet under 280 characters and can attach an image.\n- Engage with Posts: AI can like, retweet, or reply to niche-relevant content.\n- Send Direct Message: AI drafts a personalized DM for outreach or networking.\n- If your workflow includes visuals, the AI Agent - Create Image From Prompt node builds a detailed image prompt (based on your topic and instructions) and sends it to Google Gemini or other image APIs.\n- The HTTP Request - Create Image node generates a custom image via an external model (default: Pollinations.ai).\n- Finally, all tweet text and image data merge together in Merge Tweet Text and Image, before being posted directly via the Create Tweet node.\n## How To Use\n\n- Download and Import the JSON workflow into your n8n interface.\n- Set up the following credentials:\n- OpenRouter API for text generation.\n- Google Gemini (PaLM) for chat and image prompt creation.\n- Twitter OAuth2 API for posting and engagement actions.\n- Configure your form input fields (Topic, Tone, Action, Instructions).\n\nEnable or disable the nodes you want:\n\n- Create Tweet → To post automatically.\n- Twitter Engagement Tool → For likes/retweets/replies.\n- Twitter DM Tool → For automated DMs.\n- Trigger the Twitter Content Form via n8n’s web interface.\n- Enter your content preferences and submit.\n- The workflow generates your tweet text, optionally creates a matching image, and posts or saves it automatically.\n\n## Requirements\n\nA Twitter Developer Account (with OAuth2 credentials).\nA Google Gemini or OpenRouter account with text and image model access.\n(Optional) Connection to Pollinations or another AI image generation API.\n\n## How To Customize\n\n- Update “Fields – Set Values” node to change:\n- Default image size (1080 × 1920 px).\n- Model name (e.g., “flux”, “turbo”, “kontext”).\n- Modify Workflow Configuration to tweak AI parameters like:\n- imageGenerationChance (default: 0.3).\n- maxTweetLength (default: 280).\n- Replace Google Gemini Chat Model with any supported model such as OpenAI GPT-4 or Mistral.\n- Adjust AI Agent - Create Image From Prompt system message for your preferred image style or guidelines.\n- Toggle which Twitter actions are active — Post, Engage, or DM — to tailor automation to your goals.",
