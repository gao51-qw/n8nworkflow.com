  "description": "## Google Calendar MCP – Context-Aware Calendar Operations\n\nThis n8n template implements an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**-compliant module for managing **Google Calendar** events in a context-aware, conflict-free manner.\n\n### 🧠 What It Does\n\nThis MCP enables structured interaction with Google Calendar based on context and intent, ensuring reliable, reusable operations with awareness of existing data and state.\n\n### ✅ Core Capabilities\n\n- **Context-aware event creation**  \n  Prevents overlapping by validating time availability before creating new events.\n\n- **Gap validation**  \n  Checks if a time range is busy or free, enabling smarter scheduling decisions.\n\n- **Conditional updates**  \n  Only updates events after confirming their existence and current state.\n\n- **Safe deletion**  \n  Removes events using MCP principles of validation and traceability.\n\n### 🚀 How to Use\n\nTo use this MCP in your context-aware systems:\n\n1. Deploy the template in your n8n instance.\n2. Locate the **Server node** in the workflow — it exposes a **Server-Sent Events (SSE) URL**.\n3. Copy that SSE URL.\n4. Use that URL as the entry point for your MCP client or orchestrator.\n\nThis URL acts as the communication bridge, allowing you to interact with the MCP-compliant Google Calendar logic using standard MCP semantics.![Screenshot 20250517 at 2.00.14 PM.png](fileId:1339)",
