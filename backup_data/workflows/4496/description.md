## What this workflow does
This workflow processes incoming Telegram messages (text or voice, e.g. "Berlin") and generates professional podcast content about any Wikipedia topic (e.g. "Berlin", "Shakespeare", etc.). The AI agent researches the requested subject, creates a structured podcast script, and delivers it as high-quality audio directly through Telegram.

**Key Features:**
- Voice message support (speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
- Wikipedia research integration for accurate content
- Professional podcast structure (intro, main content, outro)
- Natural-sounding AI voice synthesis
- Conversational and educational tone optimized for audio consumption

This workflow has the following sequence:

1. **Telegram Trigger** - Receives incoming messages (text or voice) from users via Telegram bot
2. **Text or Voice Switch** - Routes the message based on input type (text message vs. voice message)
3. **Voice Message Processing** (if voice input):
   - Retrieval of voice file from Telegram
   - Transcription of voice message to text using OpenAI Whisper
4. **Text Message Preparation** (if text input) - Prepares the text message for the AI agent
5. **Wikipedia Podcast Agent** - Core AI agent that:
   - Researches the requested topic using Wikipedia tool
   - Creates a professional 5-minute podcast script (600-750 words)
   - Follows structured format: intro, main content, outro
   - Uses conversational, accessible, and enthusiastic tone
6. **ElevenLabs Text to Speech** - Converts the podcast script into natural-sounding audio using AI voice synthesis
7. **Send Voice Response** - Delivers the generated podcast audio back to the user via Telegram
