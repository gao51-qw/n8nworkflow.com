# 🚀 Auto-Save Instagram Leads to Google Sheets

This workflow automatically captures leads submitted through an Instagram Form and saves the data directly to a Google Sheet. It ensures that every new lead is instantly logged, creating a centralized database for your marketing and sales teams.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Receive Lead Data**  
   The workflow starts with an **Instagram Lead Webhook** that listens for new lead submissions from your Instagram account's lead form.

2. **Normalize Data**  
   A **Code node** processes the raw data received from Instagram. This node normalizes the lead information, such as name, email, and phone number, into a consistent format. It also adds a **"Source"** field to identify the lead as coming from Instagram and timestamps the entry.

3. **Save to Google Sheets**  
   Finally, the **Save to Google Sheets node** takes the normalized data and appends it as a new row in your designated Google Sheet. It uses the email field to check for existing entries and can either append a new row or update an existing one, preventing duplicate data.

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google Sheet
- Create a new Google Sheet with the following headers in the first row (A1):  

### 2. Get Sheet ID
- Find your **Sheet ID** in the URL of your Google Sheet.  
- It's the long string of characters between `/d/` and `/edit`.  
- Example:  
- Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in the **Save to Google Sheets** node with your actual ID.

### 3. Connect Instagram Form
- Copy the **Webhook URL** from the "Instagram Lead Webhook" node.  
- In your Instagram lead form settings, paste this URL as the webhook destination.  
- Ensure your form fields are mapped correctly (e.g., **name, email, phone, message**).
