  "description": "This is an end-to-end workflow for creating a simple OpenAI Assistant. The whole process is done with n8n nodes and do not require any programming experience.\n\nThe workflow is divided into three main steps:\n\n## Step 1: Get a Google Drive File and Upload to OpenAI\n\n- The workflow starts by retrieving a file from Google Drive using the \"Get File\" node.\n- The example file used is a  [Music Festival document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_miLvjUQJ-E9bWgEBK87nHZre26-4Fz0RpfSfO548H0/edit?usp=sharing).\n- The retrieved file is then uploaded to OpenAI using the \"Upload File to OpenAI\" node.\n- Run this section only once. The file is stored persistently on the OpenAI side.\n\n## Step 2: Set Up a New Assistant\n\n- In this step, a new assistant is created using the \"Create new Assistant\" node.\n- The assistant is given a name, description, and system prompt.\n- The uploaded file from Step 1 is attached as a knowledge source for the assistant.\n- Same as for Step 1, run this section only once.\n\n## Step 3: Chat with the Assistant\n\n- The \"Chat Trigger\" node initiates the conversation with the assistant.\n- The \"OpenAI Assistant\" node handles the conversation, using the assistant created in Step 2.\n\n## Step 4: Expand the Assistant\n\n- This step provides resources for ideas on how to expand the Assistant's capabilities:\n    -   [Create a WhatsApp bot](https://blog.n8n.io/whatsapp-bot/)\n    -   [Create a simple Telegram bot](https://blog.n8n.io/telegram-bots/)\n    -   [Create a Telegram AI bot (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODdRXozldPw)\n\nBy following this workflow, users can create their own AI-powered assistants using OpenAI's API and integrate them with various platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.",
