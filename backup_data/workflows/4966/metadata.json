  "description": "* Document-Aware WhatsApp AI Bot for Customer Support\n\n* Google Docs-Powered WhatsApp Support Agent\n\n* 24/7 WhatsApp AI Assistant with Live Knowledge from Google Docs\n\n# 📝Description Template\n\n## Smart WhatsApp AI Assistant Using Google Docs\n\nHelp customers instantly on WhatsApp using a smart AI assistant that reads your company’s internal knowledge from a Google Doc in real time. Built for clubs, restaurants, agencies, or any business where clients ask questions based on a policy, FAQ, or services document.\n\n# ⚙️ How it works\n\n- Users send free-form questions to your WhatsApp Business number (e.g. “What are the gym rules?” or “Are you open today?”)\n\n- The bot automatically reads your company’s internal Google Doc (policy, schedule, etc.)\n\n- It merges the document content with today’s date and the user’s question to craft a custom AI prompt\n\n- The AI (Gemini or ChatGPT) then replies back on WhatsApp using natural, helpful language\n\n- All conversations are logged to Google Sheets for reporting or audit\n\n&gt; 💡Bonus: The AI even understands dates inside the document and compares them to today’s date — e.g. if your document says “Closed May 25 for 30 days,” it will say “We're currently closed until June 24.\n\n# 🧰 Set up steps\n\n1. Connect your WhatsApp Cloud API account (Meta)\n\n2. Add your Google account and grant access to the Doc containing your company info\n\n3. Choose your AI model (ChatGPT/OpenAI or Gemini)\n\n4. Paste your document ID into the Google Docs node\n\n\n\n5. Connect your WhatsApp webhook to Meta (only takes 5 minutes)\n\n6. Done — start receiving and answering customer questions!\n\n&gt; 📄 Works best with free-tier OpenAI/Gemini, Google Docs, and Meta's Cloud API (no phone required). Everything is modular, extensible, and low-code.\n\n# 🔄 Customization Tips\n\n* Change the Google Doc anytime to update answers — no retraining needed\n\n* Add your logo and business name in the AI agent’s “System Prompt”\n\n* Add fallback routes like “Escalate to human” if the bot can't help\n\n* Clone for multiple brands by duplicating the workflow and swapping in new docs\n\n\n🤝 Need Help Setting It Up?\n\nIf you'd like help connecting your WhatsApp Business API, setting up Google Docs access, or customizing this AI assistant for your business or clients…\n\n📩 I offer setup, branding, and customization services:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp Cloud API setup & verification\n\n\n\nGoogle OAuth & Doc structure guidance\n\n\n\nAI model configuration (OpenAI / Gemini)\n\n\n\nBranding & prompt tone customization\n\n\n\nLogging, reporting, and escalation logic\n\nJust send a message via:\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: tharwat.elsayed2000@gmail.com\n\n\n\nWhatsApp: +20 106 180 3236",
