  "title": "Set up complete MERN stack development environment on Linux server",
  "description": "This automated n8n workflow sets up a complete MERN Stack development environment on a Linux server by installing core technologies, development tools, package managers, global npm packages, deployment tools, build tools, and security configurations. It creates a dedicated developer user and configures essential settings for MERN projects.\n\n## What is MERN Stack Setup?\nMERN Stack setup involves installing and configuring Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and React, along with additional tools and packages, to create a fully functional development environment for building MERN-based applications on a Linux system.\n\n## Good to Know\n- The workflow triggers manually and takes 10-15 minutes to complete\n- A dedicated developer user with proper permissions is created\n- Firewall configuration secures development ports\n- The environment variables template is provided\n- All tools are installed and ready for immediate use\n\n## How It Works\n- **Set Parameters** - Configures server host, user, password, setup type, Node.js version, MongoDB version, username, and user password\n- **System Preparation** - Prepares the system for installation\n- **Install Node.js** - Installs Node.js (v20 by default) with npm\n- **Install MongoDB** - Installs MongoDB (v7.0 by default) with Compass & Shell\n- **Install Git & GitHub CLI** - Installs Git and GitHub CLI\n- **Install Development Tools** - Installs VS Code, Docker, Docker Compose, Postman, Nginx, Redis, and PostgreSQL\n- **Create Dev User** - Creates a development user account\n- **Install Additional Tools** - Installs package managers (npm, Yarn, pnpm), global npm packages, deployment tools, build tools, and security tools\n- **Final Configuration** - Configures firewall, SSH keys, and environment variables template\n- **Setup Complete** - Marks the completion of the setup process\n\n## How to Use\n- Import the workflow into n8n\n- Configure parameters in the Set Parameters node (server_host, server_user, server_password, setup_type, node_version, mongodb_version, username, user_password)\n- Run the workflow\n- SSH into the server as the new developer user\n- Start building MERN applications\n\n## Requirements\n- Linux server access with SSH\n- Administrative privileges (root access)\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n- Adjust the setup_type parameter to customize the installation scope\n- Modify node_version or mongodb_version to use different versions\n- Change the username and user_password for the developer account",
