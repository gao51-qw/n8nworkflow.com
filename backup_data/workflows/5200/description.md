This low-code automation enables all eCommerce store visitors to upload a **photo of themselves and virtually “try on”** a garment in just a few clicks. 

With this workflow, **WooCommerce, Prestashop, Shopify** and more merchants can offer a cutting-edge “virtual try-on” feature with minimal development effort, enhancing customer engagement and reducing product returns.

### **Key Advantages**

* **Zero-Coding, Visual Setup**
  Build end-to-end e-commerce features with drag-and-drop nodes instead of custom backend code.

* **Asynchronous, Scalable Processing**
  Non-blocking “Wait” + “If” loop handles multi-second AI jobs gracefully, freeing up the workflow for other tasks.

* **Dynamic Inputs & URLs**
  Query strings (e.g. `?Product=IMAGE_URL`) allow you to embed the form on any product page and pass the garment image on the fly.

* **Seamless User Experience**
  Instant pop-up within your storefront and automatic redirect to the generated mock-up keeps shoppers engaged without page reloads.


* **Easy Credential Management**
  API keys, FTP credentials, and webhook IDs are all stored securely in n8n’s credential manager.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Form Submission**:  
   - A user submits a form with their name, an image of themselves ("Me"), and a hidden product image URL ("Product").  
   - The form is triggered via the `On form submission` node, which collects the input data.  

2. **Image Upload**:  
   - The uploaded image ("Me") is sent to an FTP server for temporary storage using the `FTP` node. The filename includes a timestamp to ensure uniqueness.  

3. **Virtual Try-on Request**:  
   - The `Create Image` node sends a POST request to the Fal.run API, providing:  
     - The uploaded human image URL (from FTP).  
     - The product image URL (from the hidden form field).  
   - This generates a virtual try-on result.  

4. **Result Processing**:  
   - The workflow checks the status of the image generation (`Get status` node) in a loop (with a 10-second wait between checks) until it is marked as "COMPLETED."  
   - Once ready, the final image URL is fetched (`Get Url image` node) and displayed to the user via a redirect (`Form` node).  

5. **User Experience**:  
   - The user is redirected to the generated try-on image, completing the process.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **API Key Setup**:  
   - Create an account and obtain an API key.  
   - Configure the `Create Image` node with HTTP Header Authentication:  
     - **Name**: `Authorization`  
     - **Value**: `Key YOURAPIKEY`  

2. **FTP/S3 Configuration**:  
   - Set up an FTP server or S3 bucket to temporarily store uploaded user images.  
   - Configure the `FTP` node with your FTP credentials and storage path.  

3. **Ecommerce Integration**:  
   - On your WooCommerce site, add a "Try On" button that opens the form in a pop-up.  
   - Dynamically pass the product image URL as a query parameter:  
     - Example: `https://URL_N8N/form/ca1c314d-46c6-4eeb-b6a5-359XXXXXX?Product=IMAGE_URL`  

4. **Testing**:  
   - Verify the workflow by submitting a test form and ensuring the virtual try-on image is generated and displayed correctly.
