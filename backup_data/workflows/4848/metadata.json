  "description": "**The Problem That it Solves**\n\nUploading music manually to YouTube is a chore. Renaming files, filling metadata, picking the right playlist, adding keywords, and scheduling the release can eat up your creative time. This workflow removes the busy work so you can focus on making tracks instead of managing uploads.\n\n**How it works**\nDrop an MP3 into your shared Google Drive “Audio” folder and walk away. The workflow detects the new file, grabs the genre from the filename based on a set of keywords, uses the genre to map to cover art styles, and YouTube playlists, generates the description and tags for YouTube metadata, and schedules and posts to YouTube channel, while sending messages to discord for updates.\n\n",
