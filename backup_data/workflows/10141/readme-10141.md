## Important Notes
- **Phone Number Format:** The workflow cleans phone numbers by removing all non-digit characters. Ensure your WooCommerce phone numbers are in a compatible format.  
- **API Rate Limits:** Rapiwa and WooCommerce APIs have rate limits. Adjust batch sizes and wait times accordingly.  
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure compliance with data protection regulations when sending marketing messages.  
- **Error Handling:** The workflow logs unverified numbers but doesn't have extensive error handling. Consider adding error notifications for failed API calls.  
- **Product Availability:** The workflow recommends the latest product in a category, but doesn't check if it's in stock. Consider adding stock status verification.  
- **Testing:** Always test with a small batch before running the workflow on your entire customer list.
