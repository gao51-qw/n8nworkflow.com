An AI Recruiter that screens, scores, and ranks candidates in minutes — directly inside n8n.  

---

## 🧠 Overview
An AI-powered recruiter workflow that compares multiple candidate CVs with a single Job Description (JD).  
It analyzes text content, calculates fit scores, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and provides automated recommendations.

⚙️ How it works
🔹 Webhook Trigger – Upload one Job Description (JD) and multiple CVs (PDF or text)
🔹 File Detector – Auto-identifies JD vs CV
🔹 Extract & Merge – Reads text and builds candidate dataset
🔹 🤖 AI Recruiter Agent – Compares JD & CVs → returns Fit Score, Strengths, Weaknesses, and Recommendation
🔹 📤 Output Node – Sends structured JSON or summary table for HR dashboards or Chat UI

Example:  
Upload JD.pdf + 3 candidate CVs → get instant JSON report with top match and recommendations.
