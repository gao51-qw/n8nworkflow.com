  "title": "Weekly HubSpot lead report to Slack",
  "description": "This n8n template posts a quick weekly snapshot to Slack so your team sees last week’s funnel movement at a glance. It counts how many contacts **entered the Lead stage** in the past week—and optionally reports **closed-won deals** from the same period.\n\nPerfect for GTM standups and Monday pipeline reviews.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n* A **weekly schedule** (e.g., Mondays 07:00) kicks things off.\n* **HubSpot → Get all contacts** pulls contacts with `hs_v2_date_entered_lead`.\n* A **filter** keeps only those whose lead date is **within the last 7 days**.\n* **Summarize** counts the resulting leads.\n* **Slack** posts: “Last week we generated **X** leads.”\n* (Optional branch) **Deals**:\n\n  * **HubSpot → Get all deals** with `hs_is_closed_won` and `hs_closed_won_date`.\n  * **Filter** to **closed-won last week**.\n  * **Summarize** to report count and (if mapped) total amount.\n\n---\n\n## How to use\n\n1. **Connect HubSpot** on the contacts and (optional) deals nodes.\n2. **Connect Slack** and pick the destination channel.\n3. In **Schedule the report**, set your preferred day/time.\n4. (Optional) For the Deals branch, include the `amount` property on “Get all deals” and set **Summarize → sum over `amount`**.\n5. Activate the workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **HubSpot** (OAuth2)\n* **Slack** (OAuth2)\n\n---\n\n## Notes & customization\n\n* **Time windows:** Adjust the filter to different periods (e.g., last 14 or 30 days).\n* **More stages:** Duplicate the contacts branch for MQL/SQL or custom lifecycle events.\n* **Richer Slack message:** Add emojis, trend vs. prior week, or a tiny leaderboard by owner.\n* **Segments:** Split by country/industry using HubSpot lists or additional filters.\n",
