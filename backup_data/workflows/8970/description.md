This n8n template posts a quick weekly snapshot to Slack so your team sees last week’s funnel movement at a glance. It counts how many contacts **entered the Lead stage** in the past week—and optionally reports **closed-won deals** from the same period.

Perfect for GTM standups and Monday pipeline reviews.

## How it works

* A **weekly schedule** (e.g., Mondays 07:00) kicks things off.
* **HubSpot → Get all contacts** pulls contacts with `hs_v2_date_entered_lead`.
* A **filter** keeps only those whose lead date is **within the last 7 days**.
* **Summarize** counts the resulting leads.
* **Slack** posts: “Last week we generated **X** leads.”
* (Optional branch) **Deals**:

  * **HubSpot → Get all deals** with `hs_is_closed_won` and `hs_closed_won_date`.
  * **Filter** to **closed-won last week**.
  * **Summarize** to report count and (if mapped) total amount.

## Notes & customization

* **Time windows:** Adjust the filter to different periods (e.g., last 14 or 30 days).
* **More stages:** Duplicate the contacts branch for MQL/SQL or custom lifecycle events.
* **Richer Slack message:** Add emojis, trend vs. prior week, or a tiny leaderboard by owner.
* **Segments:** Split by country/industry using HubSpot lists or additional filters.
