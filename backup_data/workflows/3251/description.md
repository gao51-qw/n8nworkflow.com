This workflow captures Squarespace newsletter signups in a Google Sheet and automatically creates new Mailchimp contacts in the selected audience.  

It overcomes the limitation in Squarespace’s native Mailchimp integration, which only supports [new, empty audiences](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815508-Using-Mailchimp-with-Squarespace#toc-connect-a-form-block-or-newsletter-block).  

You can trigger the workflow manually or schedule it for continuous synchronization.

## Step-by-step tutorial
- First, you need to connect Squarespace newsletter block submission to Google Drive
- In Mailchimp node, choose your targeted audience in `List Name or ID`
 
### Connect a Squarespace Form to Google Drive  
To connect a form to Google Drive:  

1. In the form's storage options, click **Connect on Google Drive**.  
2. Log into your Google account.  
3. Click **Allow** to permit Squarespace to connect to Google Drive.  
4. Enter a **Spreadsheet Name**. This creates a new spreadsheet for your form submissions.  

**Columns in my sheet:**  
- `Submitted On`  
- `Email Address`  
- `Name`  

This structure is inspired by Squarespace’s newsletter block connection, but you can modify it based on your preferred data format.
