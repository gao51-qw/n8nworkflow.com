  "title": "Check dependencies before completing Awork tasks (workaround)",
  "description": "Awork currently does not support a check for open subtasks or open dependencies when setting a task status to done. This workflow offers you a simple workaround to add this functionality to Awork and notifies users when triggered. Multiple configuration options available.\n\n**How it works**\n* Triggered via Awork Webhook call on status change of tasks\n* If task is marked as done, subtasks and/or dependent tasks are checked for their status\n* If unfinished tasks are found, a status rollback to previous status is performed and user gets notified \n\n**Set up steps**\n* Add webhook call to Awork\n* Configure Awork API credentials\n* Set up workflow configuration via setup node, e.g. user notification text, restrict to subtasks/dependency checks etc.\n\n",
