# CoinMarketCap Token Discovery (Free API) 

Automatically discover cryptocurrency tokens from CoinMarketCap, clean the data, enrich it with official websites, and store the results in your preferred database or sheet.

This workflow is designed to be **safe for free API usage**, **easy to understand**, and **ready for extension**.

---

## What This Workflow Does

This workflow runs on a schedule and:

1. Randomly selects pages from CoinMarketCap listings  
2. Fetches token data using the free CoinMarketCap API  
3. Cleans and normalizes token fields  
4. Enriches each token with official website data  
5. Processes tokens in safe batches with delays  
6. Outputs clean, structured token records  
7. Optionally saves results to a database or sheet

## How the Workflow Is Structured

- **Trigger:** Runs every few days to avoid API limits  
- **Random Page Generator:** Prevents bias toward only top tokens  
- **Batch Processing:** Controls memory and request volume  
- **Delay Logic:** Keeps the workflow stable and API-friendly  
- **Cleaning Steps:** Removes messy or invalid data  
- **Final Output:** Clean, simple token records ready for use  


---

## Output Example

Each valid token produces a clean record like:

- Token name  
- Symbol (ticker)  
- Official website  
- Source (CoinMarketCap)  
- Timestamp  

Invalid or incomplete entries are automatically skipped.

---

## Customization Ideas

You can easily extend this workflow to:

- Add social media scraping  
- Track new tokens over time  
- Trigger alerts for specific tokens  
- Combine with other crypto APIs  
- Feed data into outreach or analytics pipelines  

---

## Important Notes

- This workflow uses **CoinMarketCap’s free API tier**  
- Do not remove batch limits or delays unless you upgrade your API plan  
  
- Replace sample storage with your own before production use
