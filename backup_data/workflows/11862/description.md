## How It Works
Automates fraud risk detection for financial transactions by analyzing real-time webhook events through AI-powered scoring. Target audience: fintech companies, payment processors, and banking teams preventing fraud losses. Problem solved: manual fraud checks are reactive and slow; automated detection catches suspicious transactions instantly. Workflow receives transactions via webhook, configures processing parameters, runs OpenAI GPT-4 fraud analysis, calculates risk scores, branches on risk level, holds high-risk transactions, alerts fraud teams, logs incidents, and documents evidence for compliance investigations.


## Setup Steps
1. Configure webhook endpoint for transaction ingestion. 
2. Set OpenAI API key and fraud detection prompts. 
3. Connect Google Sheets for incident logging. 
4. Enable email alerts to fraud team distribution list. 
5. Map risk thresholds (high/low).

## Prerequisites
OpenAI API key, webhook-capable transaction source, Gmail for alerts, Google Sheets access, incident tracking database.
