  "description": "**Workflow Description:**\n\nThis workflow automates the synchronization of product data from a Shopify store to a Google Sheets document, ensuring seamless management and tracking. It retrieves product details such as title, tags, description, and price from Shopify via GraphQL queries. The outcome is a comprehensive list of products neatly organized in Google Sheets for easy access and analysis.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- Automated: Runs on a schedule you define (e.g., daily, hourly) to keep your product data fresh.\n- Complete Product Details: Retrieves titles, descriptions, variants, images, inventory, and more.\n- Cursor-Based Pagination: Efficiently handles large product sets by navigating pages without starting from scratch.\n- Google Sheets Integration: Writes product data directly to your designated sheets.\n\nSet up Instructions:\n\n1. Set up GraphQL node with Header Authentication for Shopify: \n2. Create Google Sheet Credentials: Follow this guide to set up your Google Sheet credentials for n8n: [https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/)\n3.
