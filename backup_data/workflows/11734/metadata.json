  "description": "## 📘 Description\nThis workflow turns raw product inputs into a complete, launch-ready AI-generated social media campaign package. It accepts product details via webhook, sanitizes messy fields, generates a strategic campaign blueprint, produces Instagram captions, creates discovery-optimized hashtags, generates photorealistic commercial images, computes optimal posting times, assembles all outputs into a unified JSON package, and finally delivers the entire campaign to Slack.\nMultiple AI agents work in sequence to generate structured outputs — each parsed and validated using strict JSON schemas. Images produced by DALL·E 3 are uploaded to Cloudinary for hosting. A post-processing module then merges captions, images, hashtags, and schedules into a final payload. A robust error handler ensures every failure is captured and sent to Slack with diagnostic information.\nThis workflow replaces an entire marketing team’s creative production pipeline, producing consistent, multi-asset campaign kits in minutes.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n🟢 Receive Product Details via Webhook\n Captures incoming product data including name, description, benefits, audience, and brand voice.\n\n🧹 Clean & Normalize Product Input Fields\n Sanitizes escaped characters, trims whitespace, and prepares stable fields for AI consumption.\n\n🧠 Generate Campaign Blueprint Using AI\n Creates a full strategic blueprint in structured JSON:\n • Article summary\n • Insights\n • Tone and target audience mapping\n • Platform-specific post objects\n\n🧠 LLM Engine + Structured Parser for Blueprint\n Ensures blueprint output is clean, validated JSON aligned with schema.\n\n✍️ Generate Instagram Captions Using AI\n Produces five short, conversion-ready captions + CTAs, based on blueprint insights.\n\n🧠 Caption LLM + Structured Parser\n Validates caption schema for downstream use.\n\n#️⃣ Generate Hashtag Set Using AI\n Creates 12–18 optimized hashtags using discovery strategy (broad, mid, niche).\n\n🧠 Hashtag LLM + Parser\n Validates and ensures hashtags follow correct JSON structure.\n\n🎨 Split Campaign Posts for Image Generation\n Breaks out each post’s image prompt for independent asset creation.\n\n🖼️ Generate Social Media Image Using AI\n Uses DALL·E 3 to create ultra-realistic, 8K-style commercial visuals tailored to the campaign.\n\n☁️ Upload Generated Image to Cloudinary\n Uploads rendered images and retrieves secure public URLs.\n\n🕒 Generate Optimal Posting Schedule Using AI\n Recommends best posting time per platform (Asia/Kolkata timezone) + reasoning.\n\n🧠 Schedule LLM + Parser\n Ensures a structured schedule schema with platform, time, and rationale.\n\n🔀 Combine All Campaign Assets\n Merges:\n • Cloudinary image URLs\n • Captions + CTAs\n • Hashtag set\n • Posting schedule\n into one final dataset.\n\n🧩 Prepare Final Campaign Package JSON\n Constructs production-ready unified JSON: images, captions, hashtags, schedule.\n\n💬 Send Final Campaign Package to Slack\n Delivers formatted campaign output with:\n • Image URLs\n • Captions + CTAs\n • Hashtags\n • Posting times\n for immediate creative review.\n\n🚨 Error Handler Trigger → Slack Alert\n Captures workflow failures and sends structured debugging info to Slack.\n\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n • OpenAI API (GPT-4o + DALL·E 3)\n • Cloudinary account (image hosting)\n • Slack bot token\n • Valid webhook endpoint\n • Clean product input JSON\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Full AI-generated multi-asset campaign in minutes\n ✔ Eliminates manual copywriting, design, and planning\n ✔ Ensures structured, reliable JSON at every stage\n ✔ Creates polished commercial visuals instantly\n ✔ Produces posting strategy tailored to audience behavior\n ✔ Unified campaign delivery straight to Slack\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n-  Consumer brands launching fast cycles\n-  Agencies needing rapid campaign generation\n-  Teams without in-house designers/copywriters\n-  Influencers or D2C founders wanting automated content production ",
