This is probably the most straightforward way to schedule your tweets. This n8n workflow addresses a simple problem: how to maintain consistency in your publications on X.

The workflow is direct and to the point.

In a Google spreadsheet, write all your tweets, one tweet per line.

Then, at a defined pace (for example, every 6 hours), the workflow will publish the first tweet from the list on your X account and remove it from the sheet.

This method is really simple but very efficient if you are looking for a direct and super fast solution to share regularly on X!
