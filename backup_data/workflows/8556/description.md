## Nested Loops with Sub-workflows

### Template Description

This template provides a practical solution for a common n8n challenge: creating nested loops. While a powerful feature, n8n's standard **Loop** nodes don't work as expected in a nested structure. This template demonstrates the reliable workaround using a **main workflow** that calls a separate **sub-workflow** for each iteration.

### Purpose

The template is designed to help you handle scenarios where you need to iterate through one list of data for every item in another list. This is a crucial pattern for combining or processing related data, ensuring your workflows are both clean and modular.

### Instructions for Setup

1. This template contains both the main workflow and the sub-workflow on a single canvas.
2. **Copy the sub-workflow part** of this template (starting with the **Execute Sub-workflow Trigger** node) and paste it into a new, empty canvas.
3. In the **Execute Sub-workflow** node in the **main workflow** on this canvas, update the `Sub-workflow` field to link to the new workflow you just created.
4. Run the main workflow to see the solution in action.
