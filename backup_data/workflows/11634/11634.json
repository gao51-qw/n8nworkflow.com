    "description": "# Public Transport Schedule & Delay Tracker with Microsoft Teams and Dropbox\n\n![Workflow Preview Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/4CAF50/FFFFFF?text=Public+Transport+Schedule+%26+Delay+Tracker+Workflow+Preview)\n\n**⚠️ COMMUNITY TEMPLATE DISCLAIMER: This is a community-contributed template that uses ScrapeGraphAI (a community node). Please ensure you have the ScrapeGraphAI community node installed in your n8n instance before using this template.**\n\nThis workflow automatically scrapes public transport websites or apps for real-time schedules and service alerts, then pushes concise delay notifications to Microsoft Teams while archiving full-detail JSON snapshots in Dropbox. Ideal for commuters and travel coordinators, it keeps riders informed and maintains a historical log of disruptions.\n\n## Pre-conditions/Requirements\n\n### Prerequisites\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or n8n.cloud)\n- ScrapeGraphAI community node installed\n- Microsoft Teams incoming webhook configured\n- Dropbox account with an app token created\n- Public transit data source (website or API) that is legally scrapable or offers open data\n\n### Required Credentials\n- **ScrapeGraphAI API Key** – enables web scraping\n- **Microsoft Teams Webhook URL** – posts messages into a channel\n- **Dropbox Access Token** – saves JSON files to Dropbox\n\n### Specific Setup Requirements\n| Item | Example | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| Transit URL(s) | https://mycitytransit.com/line/42 | Must return the schedule or service alert data you need |\n| Polling Interval | 5 min | Adjust via Cron node or external trigger |\n| Teams Channel | #commuter-updates | Create an incoming webhook in channel settings |\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically scrapes public transport websites or apps for real-time schedules and service alerts, then pushes concise delay notifications to Microsoft Teams while archiving full-detail JSON snapshots in Dropbox. Ideal for commuters and travel coordinators, it keeps riders informed and maintains a historical log of disruptions.\n\n## Key Steps:\n- **Webhook Trigger**: Starts the workflow (can be replaced with Cron for polling).\n- **Set Node**: Stores target route IDs, URLs, or API endpoints.\n- **SplitInBatches**: Processes multiple routes one after another to avoid rate limits.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI**: Scrapes each route page/API and returns structured schedule & alert data.\n- **Code Node (Normalize)**: Cleans & normalizes scraped fields (e.g., converts times to ISO).\n- **If Node (Delay Detected?)**: Compares live data vs. expected timetable to detect delays.\n- **Merge Node**: Combines route metadata with delay information.\n- **Microsoft Teams Node**: Sends alert message and rich card to the selected Teams channel.\n- **Dropbox Node**: Saves the full JSON snapshot to a dated folder for historical reference.\n- **StickyNote**: Documents the mapping between scraped fields and final JSON structure.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup Time: 15-25 minutes**\n\n1. **Clone or Import** the JSON workflow into your n8n instance.\n2. **Install ScrapeGraphAI** community node if you haven’t already (`Settings → Community Nodes`).\n3. **Open the Set node** and enter your target routes or API endpoints (array of URLs/IDs).\n4. **Configure ScrapeGraphAI**:\n   - Add your API key in the node’s credentials section.\n   - Define CSS selectors or API fields inside the node parameters.\n5. **Add Microsoft Teams credentials**:\n   - Paste your channel’s incoming webhook URL into the Microsoft Teams node.\n   - Customize the message template (e.g., include route name, delay minutes, reason).\n6. **Add Dropbox credentials**:\n   - Provide the access token and designate a folder path (e.g., `/TransitLogs/`).\n7. **Customize the If node** logic to match your delay threshold (e.g., ≥5 min).\n8. **Activate** the workflow and trigger via the webhook URL, or add a Cron node (every 5 min).\n\n## Node Descriptions\n\n### Core Workflow Nodes:\n- **Webhook** – External trigger for on-demand checks or recurring scheduler.\n- **Set** – Defines static or dynamic variables such as route list and thresholds.\n- **SplitInBatches** – Iterates through each route to control request volume.\n- **ScrapeGraphAI** – Extracts live schedule and alert data from transit websites/APIs.\n- **Code (Normalize)** – Formats scraped data, merges dates, and calculates delay minutes.\n- **If (Delay Detected?)** – Branches the flow based on presence of delays.\n- **Merge** – Re-assembles metadata with computed delay results.\n- **Microsoft Teams** – Sends formatted notifications to Teams channels.\n- **Dropbox** – Archives complete JSON payloads for auditing and analytics.\n- **StickyNote** – Provides inline documentation for maintainers.\n\n### Data Flow:\n1. **Webhook** → **Set** → **SplitInBatches** → **ScrapeGraphAI** → **Code (Normalize)** → **If (Delay Detected?)**  \n   ├─ true → **Merge** → **Microsoft Teams** → **Dropbox**  \n   └─ false → **Dropbox**\n\n## Customization Examples\n\n### Change to Slack instead of Teams\n```javascript\n// Replace Microsoft Teams node with Slack node\n{\n  \"text\": `🚊 *${$json.route}* is delayed by *${$json.delay}* minutes.`,\n  \"channel\": \"#commuter-updates\"\n}\n```\n\n### Filter only major delays (&gt;10 min)\n```javascript\n// In If node, use:\nreturn $json.delay &gt;= 10;\n```\n\n## Data Output Format\n\nThe workflow outputs structured JSON data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"route\": \"Line 42\",\n  \"expected_departure\": \"2024-04-22T14:05:00Z\",\n  \"actual_departure\": \"2024-04-22T14:17:00Z\",\n  \"delay\": 12,\n  \"status\": \"delayed\",\n  \"reason\": \"Signal failure at Main Station\",\n  \"scraped_at\": \"2024-04-22T13:58:22Z\",\n  \"source_url\": \"https://mycitytransit.com/line/42\"\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n1. **ScrapeGraphAI returns empty data** – Verify CSS selectors/API fields match the current website markup; update selectors after site redesigns.\n2. **Teams messages not arriving** – Ensure the Teams webhook URL is correct and the incoming webhook is still enabled.\n3. **Dropbox writes fail** – Check folder path, token scopes (`files.content.write`), and available storage quota.\n\n### Performance Tips\n- Limit `SplitInBatches` to 5-10 routes per run to avoid IP blocking.\n- Cache unchanged schedules locally and fetch only alert pages for faster runs.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Use environment variables for API keys & webhook URLs to keep credentials secure.\n- Attach a Cron node set to off-peak hours (e.g., 4 AM) for daily full-schedule backups.\n- Add a Grafana dashboard that reads the Dropbox archive for long-term delay analytics.",

            "content": "## How it works\n\nThis webhook-driven workflow listens for a POST request that contains the routes a traveler cares about. As soon as the call hits the Webhook Trigger, a Code node builds a list of official transit-authority URLs for each requested line and hands them to a Split in Batches node so every page can be scraped in parallel. ScrapeGraphAI reads each page, understands the timetable layout and the live status widget, and returns clean JSON with the next departures as well as the biggest delay currently reported. A Merge node reunites the parallel branches, after which a small Code step normalizes field names, removes duplicates and calculates the longest delay per line. An IF node checks whether any delay is above ten minutes. If so, a Microsoft Teams alert lands in your operations channel. Regardless of delay severity, every run produces a nicely formatted JSON file that is archived to Dropbox for later analysis.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. Add your ScrapeGraphAI API credential\n2. Add Dropbox credential with write access\n3. Add Microsoft Teams OAuth2 credential and fill team/channel IDs\n4. Adjust the URL list in the “Prepare Source URLs” node\n5. Change delay threshold in the IF node if needed\n6. Enable the workflow and copy the webhook URL to your mobile app\n"

The **Webhook Listener** instantly accepts the POST request and returns an acknowledgement so your client doesn’t wait around. The raw body is passed into **Prepare Source URLs**, a JavaScript Code node that translates the requested route names into the official timetable URLs published by the transit authorities. By centralising URL construction here you can easily support new cities without touching the scraping logic. The output is an array of small JSON items, each carrying a single `url` field and the matching `route` identifier. **Split URLs** then feeds those items downstream one-by-one so ScrapeGraphAI can run multiple extractions in parallel without exceeding rate limits."

Because the Split node releases one URL at a time, multiple ScrapeGraphAI executions can run side-by-side, keeping the overall response time low. **Merge Results** operates in pass-through mode so everything the scraper returns is funnelled back into a single stream. This design means you can add more URLs—perhaps for buses or trams—without changing any logic further down the pipeline: just add the URLs and let the scraper plus merge combination handle aggregation automatically."

The cleaned dataset flows into **Significant Delay?**, an IF node that compares the calculated `max_delay_minutes` against a configurable threshold (default is 10). Items on the TRUE branch head straight to **Send Teams Alert**, which posts an HTML-formatted card into your chosen Microsoft Teams channel so riders or operations staff see issues instantly.

Storing plain JSON files keeps costs low and makes it trivial to import the records into BI tools later. Because the Teams branch also flows into the Set node, you end up with a single, unified audit trail regardless of whether a delay alert was triggered."
