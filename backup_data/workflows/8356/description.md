Effortlessly generate, review, and publish SEO-optimized blog posts to WordPress using AI and automation.

## How It Works
AI Topic Generation: Gemini suggests trending blog topics matching your agency's services.

Content Research: Tavily fetches recent relevant articles for each generated topic.

Human Review: Choose the preferred article for publishing through a Telegram notification.

AI Rewriting: Gemini rewrites the selected article into a polished, SEO-friendly post.

Image Generation & Publishing: The workflow creates a featured image with Gemini or OpenAI, then publishes the post (with dynamic categories and images) to WordPress.

Audit Trail: Every published post is logged to Google Sheets, and final details are sent to Telegram.

## Set Up Steps
- Estimated setup time: 15–30 minutes (excluding API approval/wait times).

- Connect your WordPress, Gemini (Google), Tavily, Google Sheets, and Telegram accounts.

- Configure your preferred posting schedule in the “Schedule Trigger.”

- Adjust prompts or messages to fit your agency’s niche or editorial voice if needed.
