## Requirements

The workflow relies on the following components and configurations:

### **n8n Platform**

Acts as the automation environment for scheduling, fetching, formatting, and delivering AI news updates.

### **Node Requirements**

1. **Schedule Trigger**

   * Runs the workflow every day at 10:00 AM.
   * Automates the process without manual initiation.

2. **Message a model (Perplexity API)**

   * Uses the **sonar-pro model** from Perplexity AI.
   * Fetches the most recent AI developments in the past 24 hours.
   * Outputs results as a **self-contained HTML email** with inline CSS (card-style layout).

3. **Send a message (Gmail)**

   * Sends the generated HTML email with the subject: *“Latest Tech and AI news update 🚀”*.
   * Recipients: `xyz@gmail.com`.

4. **HTML Node**

   * Processes the AI model’s HTML response.
   * Ensures the email formatting is clean, valid, and ready for delivery.

### **Credentials**

* **Perplexity API account**: For fetching AI news.
* **Gmail OAuth2 account**: For secure email delivery.

### **Input Requirements**

* No manual input required; the workflow runs automatically on schedule.

### **Output**

* A **daily AI news digest email** containing:

  * Headlines in bold.
  * One-sentence summaries in normal text.
  * Full URLs as clickable links.
  * Styled in a clean card-based format with hover effects.

## API Usage

The workflow integrates APIs to achieve automation:

1. **Perplexity API**

   * Used in the **Message a model** node.
   * The API fetches the latest AI news, ensures data accuracy, and outputs HTML formatted content.
   * Provides styling via inline CSS (Segoe UI font, light background, card design).
   * Ensures the news is fresh (past 24 hours only).

2. **Gmail API**

   * Used in the **Send a message** node.
   * Handles the secure delivery of emails with OAuth2 authentication.
   * Sends AI news updates directly to inboxes.

## HTML Processing

The **HTML Node** ensures proper formatting before email delivery:

* **Process**: Cleans and validates HTML (`$json.message`) generated by Perplexity.
* **Output**: A self-contained HTML email with proper structure (`&lt;html&gt;`, `&lt;head&gt;`, `&lt;body&gt;`).
* **Relevance**: Ensures Gmail sends a **styled digest** instead of raw text.
