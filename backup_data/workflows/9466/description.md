# AI Powered All Purpose Appointment System via JotForm

## What This Workflow Does

This template automates the entire appointment request lifecycle using AI. When someone submits an appointment request through JotForm, the system automatically sends details for approval, generates personalized confirmation or rejection emails using OpenAI, and maintains records—all without manual intervention.

## How It Works

1. **Form Submission** – Appointment request arrives via JotForm

3. **Approval Request** – Details are sent to Telegram for review and approval
4. **AI Email Generation** – OpenAI creates personalized confirmation or rejection email based on approval status
5. **Smart Routing** – If approved: records in Google Sheets and sends confirmation. If rejected: removes from system and sends reschedule notice
6. **Automated Follow-up** – Requester receives professional email instantly

## Getting Started (Quick Setup)

### Step 1: Choose Your JotForm
- Select any existing appointment form or create a new one in JotForm

### Step 2: Map Your Form Fields

- Update the "Parse: Extract Appointment Details" node with your exact field names
- This ensures the workflow reads data correctly from your specific form

### Step 3: Follow Full Setup Steps
