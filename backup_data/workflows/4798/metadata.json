  "description": "**Create, iterate, and share! Transform a single image through multiple scenes while maintaining consistency.**\n\n## ✨ What this workflow does\n\nThis template showcases **FLUX.1 Kontext** - [Black Forest Labs' in-context image generation model](https://bfl.ai/announcements/flux-1-kontext) that excels at maintaining character features across multiple transformations. Combined with the [Upload Post community node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-upload-post) for effortless multi-platform social media posting, you can create and share compelling visual stories instantly.\n\nThe workflow demonstrates FLUX Kontext's core strength: **character consistency across multiple image generations**. Starting with a single input image, it:\n1. 🖼️ **Loads an initial character image** (example: a cute animal mascot)\n2. 📝 **Defines multiple scene transformation prompts** \n3. 🔄 **Iteratively generates new scenes** while preserving exact character features\n4. 🎯 **Maintains visual consistency** by reusing binary data from previous generations\n5. 📱 **Auto-posts the complete transformation series** to multiple social platforms simultaneously\n\n## 🚀 Key Features: The Consistency Advantage\n\n- **Character Preservation**: FLUX Kontext's signature feature - maintains character features and style across transformations (requires specific prompting techniques)\n- **Iterative Context Building**: Each generation uses the previous image as context, creating visual continuity\n- **Binary Data Reuse**: Smart workflow design that feeds output from one generation as input to the next\n- **Multi-Scene Storytelling**: Transform your character across different environments while keeping them recognizable\n- **One-Click Multi-Platform Posting**: [Upload Post](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=post-now&tenantId=upload-post-app)* eliminates the tedious process of posting to each platform individually\n\n## 📱 Why use Upload Post?\n\nPosting the same content to TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, X (Twitter), and Threads individually is time-consuming and error-prone. The [Upload Post service](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=post-now&tenantId=upload-post-app)* simplifies this process:\n\n✅ **Connect once, post everywhere**: Link all your social media accounts to Upload Post  \n✅ **Single API call**: Post to multiple platforms with one simple node  \n✅ **No more platform juggling**: Skip the endless switching between apps and dashboards  \n✅ **Consistent timing**: All platforms get your content simultaneously  \n✅ **Trusted by 3,751+ users**: Proven solution for content creators and marketers\n\nInstead of spending 30+ minutes manually posting to each platform, **Upload Post does it all in seconds** with a single n8n node!\n\n## 🛠️ Prerequisites\n\n### Required Accounts:\n1. **Black Forest Labs API**: Create account at [dashboard.bfl.ai](https://dashboard.bfl.ai/)\n   - Get your API key for FLUX Kontext Pro access\n   \n2. **Upload Post Account**: Sign up at [upload-post.com](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=post-now&tenantId=upload-post-app)*\n   - Connect your social media profiles (TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Facebook, X/Twitter, Threads)\n   - Get API credentials for automated posting\n   - **Free tier available**: 10 uploads/month\n\n[![image.png](fileId:1462)](https://www.upload-post.com/?linkId=lp_144414&sourceId=post-now&tenantId=upload-post-app)\n\n## 💡 Perfect For:\n\n- **Character Designers** maintaining brand character integrity across scenes\n- **Social Media Managers** creating engaging visual story series without manual posting\n- **Brand Marketers** ensuring character consistency across campaigns\n- **Storytellers** building visual narratives with consistent protagonists\n- **Agencies** managing multiple client accounts efficiently\n\n## 🔧 Customization Options:\n\n- **Modify transformation prompts** to create your own character journey\n- **Adjust iteration steps**\n- **Change initial character image**\n- **Configure social platform targeting** (choose which platforms to post to)\n- **Customize post content** and formatting\n- **Experiment with different consistency scenarios**\n\n*\\* Affiliate link*",
