  "description": "# 🤖 AI-Powered Job Matcher & Resume Customizer\n\n## Description\n\nThis advanced workflow automates the entire job search and preparation process, moving beyond simple notifications to provide **AI-driven career intelligence**.\n\nIt connects to LinkedIn to scrape fresh job postings, filters against jobs you've already seen, and then uses powerful LLMs (Mistral Large/Small) to perform a detailed resume-to-job match, generate tailored cover letters, and provide concrete resume improvement suggestions. All data is logged into a Google Sheet for comprehensive tracking, and a clean, single **Daily Digest Email** summarizes the top 5 matches found each day.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n* **Automated Scheduling:** Runs daily to find new job postings.\n* **Multi-Keyword Search:** Uses your main job title and three alternate titles generated by an AI Agent for maximum search coverage.\n* **LinkedIn Web Scraping:** Pulls new job URLs, details, location, and salary data from LinkedIn Search results.\n* **Duplicate Prevention:** Uses the **Compare Datasets** node to ensure only new, unseen jobs are processed against your master Google Sheet.\n* **Intelligent Matching (LLM):** The workflow performs a detailed job-to-resume comparison, generating:\n    * A **Match Score (0-100)** with evidence for alignment in skills, experience, and domain.\n    * A **Tailored Cover Letter** specific to the job title and company.\n    * **Actionable Resume Improvement** points (e.g., `[ADD]`, `[QUANTIFY]`) to optimize your resume for the specific role.\n* **Centralized Tracking:** Saves all job data, match scores, cover letters, and resume suggestions to a **Google Sheet**.\n* **Professional Daily Digest:** Sends a single, clean **HTML email** summarizing the top 5 highest-scoring job matches for easy review.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Prerequisites\n\n1.  **n8n Credentials:**\n    * **Google Drive:** To download your resume (PDF/DOCX file URL).\n    * **Google Sheets:** To connect to your job tracking sheet.\n    * **Gmail:** To send the daily digest email.\n    * **Mistral Cloud:** For the LLM processing (Resume Breakdown, Job Matching, and Resume Analysis).\n2.  **External Files:**\n    * A **Job Tracking Google Sheet** (used as a master database).\n    * Your current **Resume file** (PDF recommended, hosted on Google Drive).\n3.  **Setup Notes:**\n    * Update the file links (`Download Resume` node) and Google Sheet details (`Get row(s)`/`Append` nodes).\n    * Set your personal email address in the `Send Digest Email` node.\n    * Review the LLM prompts to tailor the AI agent's persona and output fields to your exact needs.",
