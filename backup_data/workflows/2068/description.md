**A n8n workflow designed to shorten URLs using Dub.co API.**

**How it works:**
It shortens a url using Dub.co API, with the ability to use custom domains and projects. It updates the current shortened url if the slug has been already used.

**Estimated Time:** Around 15 minutes.
**Requirements:** A Dub.co account.
**Configuration:** 
Configure the "API Auth" node to add your Dub.co API key, project slug, and the long URL. There some extras that you're able to configure too. You will be able to do that by clicking the "API Auth" node and filling the fields.
**Detailed Instructions:** Sticky notes within the workflow provide extensive setup information and guidance.
