This n8n template demonstrates how to automatically analyze all your accumulated notes from the past week and generate actionable insights, task lists, and priorities using AI.

Use cases are many: Try automating weekly planning sessions, extracting action items from meeting notes, identifying recurring themes in your thoughts, or creating data-driven weekly reports for personal productivity tracking!

## Good to know

- ChatGPT analysis costs approximately $0.01-0.05 per week depending on the volume of notes
- The workflow uses advanced date filtering to process exactly 7 days of content
- Email sending requires SMTP configuration (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- **Perfect companion:** Works seamlessly with the "**Audio Notes to Google Docs**" workflow - it reads and analyzes all notes created by that system!

## How it works

- A schedule trigger runs every Sunday at your preferred time (default: 11 PM)
- The workflow reads your complete Google Doc containing all accumulated notes
- A smart filter function extracts only entries from the past 7 days using date stamp recognition
- The filtered content gets sent to ChatGPT which analyzes patterns and extracts:

Actionable tasks for next week
Important deadlines and appointments
Key insights and learnings
Top 3 priorities
Category distribution (Work, Private, Health, etc.)


- A second AI call creates a personalized email summary with context and recommendations
- The structured analysis gets appended to your Google Doc as a weekly summary
- You receive a Telegram notification when the review is complete
- A detailed email report lands in your inbox with the full analysis and action items

## How to use

- The workflow runs automatically every Sunday - no manual intervention needed
- Adjust the schedule trigger to your preferred day/time for weekly planning
- Review the email summary and use the extracted tasks for your upcoming week planning
- The Google Doc serves as your permanent archive of weekly insights

## Requirements

- Google Docs API access to read your notes document
- OpenAI API account for ChatGPT analysis (GPT-4 recommended for best results)
- SMTP email configuration for sending summary reports
- Telegram Bot Token for notifications
- **Prerequisite:** The **"Audio Notes to Google Docs**" workflow or similar system that creates timestamped entries

## Customising this workflow

- Modify the AI analysis prompt to focus on specific areas (business metrics, health tracking, learning goals)
- Add multiple analysis modes (daily, bi-weekly, monthly reviews)
- Include additional outputs like calendar event creation, task manager integration, or team sharing
- Connect to project management tools like Notion, Asana, or Monday.com for automatic task creation
