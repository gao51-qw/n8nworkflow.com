**How it works**  
1. Trigger the workflow manually via the n8n UI.  
2. Define key parameters like the image prompt, number of images, size, quality, and model.  
3. Send a POST request to OpenAI’s image generation API using those inputs.  
4. Split the API response to handle multiple images.  
5. Convert the base64 image data into downloadable binary files.

**Set up steps**  
Initial setup takes around 5–10 minutes. You’ll need an OpenAI API key, a configured HTTP Request node with credentials, and to customize the prompt/parameter fields in the “Set Variables” node. No advanced config or external services needed.

**Important Note**
You have to make sure to complete OpenAI's new verification requirements to use their new image API:

It only takes a few minutes and does not cost any money.
