    "description": "## Disclaimer\nThis workflow contains a community node.\n![PDF n8n.png](fileId:1662)\n\n# What It Does\nLeverage the power of GPT-4o to seamlessly summarize a scientific research PDF of your choosing. By simply downloading a PDF of a scientific research article into a folder on your computer this powerful workflow will automatically read the article and produce a detailed summarization of the article. The workflow will then save this summarization onto your computer for future convenience.\n# Who Is This For?\nThe workflow is the perfect tool for all types of self-learners attempting to improve their knowledge base as efficiently as possible. It is a way to rapidly improve your knowledge base using peer reviewed scientific articles in a quick and efficient way. This workflow will provide a more detailed summary of the scientific research article than a typical abstract, while taking a fraction of the time it would take to read an entire paper. It will provide you with enough information to have a firm grasp on the information provided within the scientific article and will allow you to determine if you would like to dive deeper into the article.  This workflow is perfect for professionals who need to stay current on the most recent literature in their field, as well as the self-learners who enjoy diving deep into a specific topic. It can aid anyone who is performing academic research, a literature review, or attempting to increase their knowledge base in a field using peer reviewed sources.\n# How It Works\nUtilizing the power of GPT-4o, the moment you save a PDF of a scientific research article to a predesignated folder it will being to read the article and produce a summary that will be saved into another designated folder on your computer via the following steps below.\n- Search the internet and your favorite journal databases for a scientific article that interests you.\n- With the n8n workflow activated, download a PDF of the scientific article and save it to a specific designated folder.\n- Saving the scientific article to this folder will trigger the workflow to initiate.\n- The workflow will then extract the contents of the PDF and pass the data along to an AI agent utilizing the power of GPT-4o.\n- This AI agent will produce a detailed summary of the scientific article.\n \t- This summary will include the following:\n\t- **Introduction heading** discussing the importance of the article and the specific aims of the study\n\t- **Methods heading** detailing how the study was conducted, what variables they evaluated, what their inclusion and exclusion criteria were, and what their measurement standards were.\n\t- **Results heading** providing specific data provided in the study for all variables tested as well as the statistical significance of each result.\n\t- **Summary heading** evaluating the importance of the results, how it compares to other scientific articles in the same field, as well as the recommendations of the authors on how to interpret the data provided by the results.\n\t- **Conclusion heading** summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific article as well as providing deficiencies in knowledge on the subject that would be a good topic for future studies.\n- After the AI agent has completed its summary, it will convert the summary to text and save it to a designated folder on your computer for future viewing.\n# Set Up Steps\n1.  You will need to create a folder on your computer where you would like to save your scientific article PDFs. You will then copy the pathway to this folder into the local file trigger node.\n2.  You will need to obtain an Open AI API key from platform.openai.com/api-keys\n3.  After you obtain this Open AI API key you will need to connect it to the Open AI Chat Model connected to the Summarizer Tools Agent.\n4.  You will now need to fund your Open AI account. GPT-4o costs ~$0.01 to run the workflow.\n5.  Finally, create a folder on your computer you wish to have the summarizations saved to. Copy the pathway to this folder into the Save to Folder node.\n# Customization\nThis workflow is easy to customize to a specific area of research to provide the best possible summarization. If you have a specific expertise in a field of study, you can customize the output to provide data at a higher level of understanding for that field. For example, if you are a marine biologist, you can change the portion of the text prompt in the summarizer tool from \"You are a research expert who is providing data to another researcher.\" to \"You are a marine biologist expert who is providing data to another marine biologist.\"\n# Disclaimer\nIf the pdf is too large, open AI will not be able to summarize it and will provide the error that you have reached your limit of requests.",

This cost ~$0.01 per run. You must put money, recommend no more than $5, into your open ai account.\n-Click on your profile again. On left hand side click on billing.  Add credit to balance.\n \n \n \nRight click on save to folder node.\n-Insert path to folder where you want the summary saved.\n-Example C:/Desktop/Summary/Summary.txt\nTips: you can try saving it as a pdf, but I found saving it as a txt had less errors. \n-You can copy the path again, but you must make sure all \\ are / in the path. This is how n8n interprets the pathway. The trigger node does not matter and should not be changed because the converter node does this automatically.\n \n \nCommon issues:\n-If your first open/read/write files from disk node has an error saying no data, try running n8n as administrator.\n-If running localhost, search command prompt or terminal, before opening right click and choose run as administrator. Then start n8n as you normally would.\n-If the pdf is too large open AI will not be able to summarize it and will have an error that you have reached your limit of requests.\n \n \n \nHow it works:\nYou will have a folder predetermined on your computer. When you find a pdf of a scientific article that you would like a summary of, open n8n and click test workflow. Then save the pdf to the dedicated folder. With n8n running you click test step on the trigger. It will automatically produce a summary of the pdf and save it to a specified folder.\n \nHow to improve:\nIf you have a specific expertise in a field of study, you can customize the output to that field. For example, if you are a marine biologist, you can change the portion of the text prompt in the summarizer tool from \"You are a research expert who is providing data to another researcher.\" to \"You are a marine biologist expert who is providing data to another marine biologist.\""
