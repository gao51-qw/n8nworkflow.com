  "description": "This n8n template uses AI to automatically classify incoming Gmail messages into five categories and route them to the right people or departments. It can also reply automatically and send WhatsApp alerts for urgent or relevant messages.\nThis helps ensure high-priority emails never get missed, while other messages are handled efficiently.\n\n##How It Works\n1. Trigger\nA new email in Gmail triggers the workflow.\n\n2. Classification (OpenAI GPT)\nThe email is analyzed by an OpenAI GPT model and classified into one of:\n\nHigh Priority\nCustomer Support\nPromotion\nFinance/Billing\nRandom/Other\n\n3. Conditional Logic & Actions\nHigh Priority → Create draft reply + send WhatsApp alert.\n\nCustomer Support → Auto-reply + send WhatsApp confirmation alert.\n\nPromotion → Summarize email + send WhatsApp promotional alert.\n\nFinance/Billing → Forward to finance team + send WhatsApp finance alert.\n\nRandom/Other → Label and log only.\n\n4. Multi-Channel Output\nResponses are sent via Gmail.\nAlerts are sent via WhatsApp (or another compatible API).\n\n##Setup Instructions\nStep 1: Gmail Authorization\nAdd a Gmail node in n8n.\nConnect using OAuth2 and grant read/send permissions.\n\nStep 2: OpenAI API Key\nGet your API key from OpenAI.\nAdd it to n8n credentials for the OpenAI node.\n\nStep 3: WhatsApp Integration\nUse your WhatsApp Business API or a provider like Twilio or 360Dialog.\n\nReplace placeholders with your details:\n\n[YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER]\n[YOUR_FINANCE_TEAM_NUMBER]\n[YOUR_SUPPORT_TEAM_NUMBER]\n\nStep 4: Import & Run\nImport the workflow JSON into n8n.\nAdjust prompts, labels, and routing logic as needed.\nExecute and monitor results.\n\n##Good to Know\nFully customizable — add or remove categories, adjust responses, and change alert channels.\n\nCan be integrated with Slack, Discord, Trello, Notion, Jira, or CRM systems.\n\nScales easily across teams and departments.\n\n##Requirements\nGmail account with OAuth2 credentials set up in n8n\n\nOpenAI API key for classification and content generation\n\nWhatsApp (or other messaging service) integration\n\nOptional: Slack, Notion, CRM, or accounting tool integrations\n\n##Customization Ideas\nCreate support tickets in Trello, Notion, or Jira from Customer Support emails.\n\nSync Finance emails with QuickBooks, Stripe, or Google Sheets.\n\nReplace WhatsApp alerts with Slack or Discord messages.\n\nUse Zapier/Make for cross-platform automations.",
