# Amazon Product Price Tracker

This workflow automatically monitors Amazon product prices, tracks price changes, and sends alerts when significant price fluctuations occur. Built with ScrapeOps' structured data API, it provides a reliable, maintenance-free solution for price tracking without worrying about anti-bot measures or complex selectors.

## What This Workflow Does

- Monitors multiple Amazon products simultaneously using their ASINs
- Calculates both absolute and percentage price changes
- Sends customizable email alerts when prices cross defined thresholds
- Maintains a historical record of all price data for trend analysis
- Updates a Google Sheets with the latest price information

## Prerequisites

- A ScrapeOps API key (register at https://scrapeops.io)
- Google account for Google Sheets integration
- SMTP email configuration for alerts

## How It Works

The workflow reads product ASINs from your Google Sheet, fetches current pricing data via ScrapeOps' Amazon Product API, calculates price changes, updates your spreadsheet, and sends alerts when price movements exceed your defined thresholds.

Unlike traditional web scrapers that break when websites change, this solution uses ScrapeOps' reliable API that handles all the complexity of Amazon data extraction, ensuring consistent results without maintenance.
