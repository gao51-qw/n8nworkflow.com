## How It Works
This workflow provides automated Chinese text translation with high-quality audio synthesis for language learning platforms, content creators, and international communication teams. It addresses the challenge of converting Chinese text into accurate multilingual translations with natural-sounding voiceovers. The system receives Chinese text via webhook, validates input formatting, and processes it through an AI translation agent that generates multiple language versions. Each translation is converted to speech using ElevenLabs' neural voice models, then formatted into professional audio responses. A quality review agent evaluates translation accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and audio clarity against predefined criteria. High-scoring outputs are returned via webhook for immediate use, while low-quality results trigger review processes, ensuring consistent delivery of publication-ready multilingual audio content.
