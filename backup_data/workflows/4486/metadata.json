  "description": "\nThis template can be used to **upload the files in your Google drive** to an **[InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com)**. \n\nThe InfraNodus graph will then reveal the **main topics** and **ideas** in your collection of documents and show the **content gaps** in them. You can also use the **built-in AI** to converse with the documents.\n\n![InfraNodus graph](https://infranodus.com/images/front/infranodus-overview.jpg)\n\nYou can also access the InfraNodus Graphs via its **GraphRAG API** to re-use them in your other n8n workflows for high-quality content retrieval and knowledge base optimization.\n\nThe template showcases the use of multiple n8n nodes and processes:\n- Extracting documents from a Google Drive folder\n- text extraction\n- optional: high-quality PDF conversion using [ConvertAPI](https://convertapi.com?ref=4l54n)\n- [InfraNodus knowledge graph](https://infranodus.com) generation\n\n\n***Note**: If you want to **Sync your Google drive** to an InfraNodus graph, check out our other workflow*\n\n## How it works\n\nHere's a description of this workflow step by step:\n\n- Find all the files in a specific Google drive folder\n- For each file found: reiterate the workflow and\n- Identify the type of the file (TXT, PDF, Markdown)\n- For TXT and Markdown files extract the text data \n- For PDF files use a special PDF to Text convertor to extract the text data. (Optional: using [ConvertAPI](https://convertapi.com?ref=4l54n) for better quality PDF conversion)\n- Forward everything to the InfraNodus `graphAndStatements` [API endpoint](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/13605983537692-InfraNodus-API-Access-Points) with the `name` of the new graph, the `text` field with the text data, the text settings, and `doNotSave=false` to create a new graph\n- Reiterate through another file.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nYou need an [InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) to use this workflow. \n\n- Create an InfraNodus account\n- Get the API key at [https://infranodus.com/api-access](https://infranodus.com/api-access) and create a Bearer authorization key for the InfraNodus HTTP nodes.\n- Use that API key to set up authorization for the InfraNodus tool in the workflow.\n- If you want to upload the files to an existing graph, you should copy its name from InfraNodus. Otherwise you can specify any name you want.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- An [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com/use-case/ai-knowledge-graphs) account and API key\n- A Google Drive account and authorization (you will need to set it up via Google Cloud using the n8n instructions provided in the Google Drive node).\n\n\n## Customizing this workflow\n\nYou can use Dropbox instead of Google Drive.\n\nYou can also modify this workflow slightly to make it Sync with a Google Drive when the new files appear in it.\n\nCheck out the **complete guide** at [https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20267019838108-Upload-Sync-Your-Google-Drive-Folder-with-InfraNodus-using-n8n](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/20267019838108-Upload-Sync-Your-Google-Drive-Folder-with-InfraNodus-using-n8n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
