Designed for content marketers, SEO specialists, and digital agencies, it solves the time-consuming challenge of researching trending topics and crafting search-optimized content at scale. The system pulls discussions from Reddit, videos from YouTube, and industry news via APIs, then combines this data into comprehensive insights.
