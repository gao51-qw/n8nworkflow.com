# Use case
Instead of hiring an SEO expert, I run this report weekly. It checks the keyword rankings of the past week and gives me recommendations on what to improve.

# How it works
The workflow gathers SerpBear analytics for the past 7 days.
It passes the data to openrouter.ai for A.I. analysis.
Finally it saves to baserow.

# How to use this
Input your SerpBearcredentials
Enter your domain name
Input your Openrouter.ai credentials
Input your baserow credentials
You will need to create a baserow database with columns: Date, Note, Blog
