# Automatically Reply to Customer Emails with Airtable, Gmail, and OpenAI
![repondreautomatiquementemailsn8nairtablegmailopenai.png](fileId:2643)
## Introduction

This guide walks you step by step through setting up an automated agent that:
- Receives emails sent by your customers.  
- Analyzes the content of the email.  
- Generates an appropriate response using an AI model (OpenAI GPT).  
- Stores all information (received email, AI response, date, customer email) in Airtable.  
- Automatically replies to the customer in the same Gmail thread.  

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you’ll need:  
- A [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) account connected to n8n.  
- An [Airtable](https://airtable.com) account.  
- An [n8n](https://n8n.io) instance (cloud or self-hosted).  
- An [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) API key.

## Prepare the Airtable Base

![Baseairtable.png](fileId:2645)

No need to build everything from scratch — here’s a ready-to-use base you can copy:  
👉 [Open the Airtable base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invnYug7i1yK7gqd4&inviteToken=9cd007631d148208bf689d2af7fd95039839ca775a18ad434918652ea370b86e&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts)

It already contains the following structure:  
- **Subject** (text) → email subject.  
- **Date** (date/time) → date of reception.  
- **Customer Email** (text) → customer’s email address.  
- **Message** (long text) → body of the received email.  
- **AI Response** (long text) → AI-generated reply.  

You can reuse it as it is or duplicate it into your Airtable account.  

## 1. Set Up Gmail Trigger in n8n

![automatisationsupportclientn8nairtablegmail.png](fileId:2644)

Alright, now that we have our Airtable base ready, we need to capture customer emails.  
That’s the job of the **Gmail Trigger**. Basically, this node lies in wait inside your inbox, and as soon as a new message arrives… *bam*, your workflow fires up.

### Connect Your Gmail Account
- In n8n, add a **Gmail Trigger** node.  
- Click **Credential to connect with** and select your Gmail account.  
- If you haven’t done it yet, click **Add new**, connect your Google account, and allow access.  
Pro tip: don’t worry, it won’t read your personal emails to gossip — everything stays inside your workflow.  

### Basic Settings
- **Poll Times**: select `Every Minute`.  
   → This way, n8n checks your inbox every minute.  
- **Mode**: `Message Received`.  
   → You want the flow to trigger whenever a customer writes to you.  
- **Event**: `Message Received`.  
   → Same logic, keep it simple.  
- **Simplify**: turn it off (`OFF`).  
   → Why? Because if you enable "Simplify," you only get a stripped-down version of the email. And you want it all: subject, sender, raw message… the full package.  

### Expected Output
When you execute the node, you should see:  
- **id**: unique identifier of the email.  
- **threadId**: conversation identifier (super useful to reply in the same thread).  
- **snippet**: a short preview of the email (first lines).  
- **From**: your customer’s email address.  
- **To**: your email address.  
- **Subject**: the subject of the email.  
- **payload**: the full body of the email (yep, in base64 — but we’ll handle that later).  

And that’s it — your Gmail Trigger is set up. In short, the moment a customer writes “Hey, I have an issue with my account,” your workflow kicks in instantly (well, almost — it checks every minute).  

## 2. Set Up the AI Agent in n8n

![sauvegarderemailsreponsesairtablen8n.png](fileId:2646)

After configuring your **Gmail Trigger** (which captures incoming customer emails), you now need a **brain** to take over, analyze the email, and draft a reply.  
That’s where the **AI Agent node** comes in.

### Its Role
The **AI Agent** node is used to:  
- Read the email content (via the Gmail Trigger).  
- Understand the context and tone of the customer.  
- Generate a clear, concise, and human-like response.  
- Prepare a personalized reply that will later be sent back via Gmail and stored in Airtable.  

In short, it’s your **24/7 support colleague**, but coded as a bot.  

---

### How to Configure It
- **Source for Prompt (User Message)** → choose `Define below`.  
- **Prompt (User Message)** → describe your business and role as if you were training an intern.  
  Example: *“You are an AI support agent for a company that sells solar panels. You respond to technical requests, quotes, and customer questions. Your replies must be short, clear, friendly, and precise.”*  
- **Chat Model** → connect your AI model (e.g. OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini).  
- **Memory (optional but recommended)** → connect a **Conversation Memory** node.  
  → This allows the AI to retain conversation history and better understand follow-ups.  

---

### Expected Output
When you run this node, you should see in the output:  
- A field `output` containing the automatically generated AI reply.  
- The text should be short, natural, and adapted to the customer’s tone (casual or formal).  

👉 With the Gmail Trigger you capture emails, and with the AI Agent you get a reply ready to send — as if you had written it yourself.  

## 3. Save Emails and Responses in Airtable

Now that your **AI Agent** generates replies, you need to store them somewhere to keep a clear record of all interactions.  
That’s where **Airtable** comes in.

### Quick Reminder
You’ve already copied my ready-to-use Airtable base:  
👉 [Access the base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invnYug7i1yK7gqd4&inviteToken=9cd007631d148208bf689d2af7fd95039839ca775a18ad434918652ea370b86e&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts)

This base contains a table **Email Support Logs** with the following columns:  
- **Subject**  
- **Date**  
- **Customer Email**  
- **Message**  
- **AI Response**  

---

### How to Connect Airtable in n8n
1. Add an **Airtable** node right after your **AI Agent**.  
2. Under **Operation**, select `Create`.  
3. In **Base** → choose **BASE AGENT IA EMAIL**.  
4. In **Table** → select **Email Support Logs**.  

---

### Map the Correct Values
Then, link the fields as follows:  
- **Subject** → `{{ $('Email Received').item.json.Subject }}`  
- **Customer Email** → `{{ $('Email Received').item.json.From }}`  
- **Message** → `{{ $('Email Received').item.json.snippet }}`  
- **AI Response** → `{{ $('AI Agent').item.json.output }}`  
- **Date** → `{{ $now }}`  

---

### Expected Output
For each new email received:  
- Gmail captures the email.  
- Your AI drafts the reply.  
- All details (email, sender, subject, reply) are automatically stored in your Airtable base.  

👉 You now have a fully automated **customer support log**.  

## 4. Automatically Reply to the Customer in Gmail

Now that you’re storing each interaction in Airtable, it’s time to **send your AI’s reply directly back to the customer**.  
This closes the loop: customer writes → AI replies → everything gets logged in Airtable.

### Add the Gmail Reply Node
1. Add a **Gmail** node right after your **AI Agent** (or after Airtable if you prefer logging before replying).  
2. Under **Operation**, select `Reply`.  
3. Connect your Gmail account (same credential as your Gmail Trigger).  

### Configure the Reply
- **Thread ID** → `{{ $('Email Received').item.json.threadId }}`  
   → Ensures the reply is sent in the same conversation thread.  
- **To** → `{{ $('Email Received').item.json.From }}`  
   → Customer’s email address.  
- **Subject** → `Re: {{ $('Email Received').item.json.Subject }}`  
   → The "Re:" keeps the continuity of the conversation.  
- **Message Body** → `{{ $('AI Agent').item.json.output }}`  
   → This is the text automatically generated by your AI.  

---

### Expected Output
When a customer sends an email:  
- Gmail Trigger captures the message.  
- The AI Agent generates a tailored reply.  
- Airtable logs the full interaction.  
- Gmail automatically sends the response in the same conversation thread.  

Your customer receives a **quick, personalized, and natural reply** without you typing a single word.  

👉 You now have a **complete support agent**: listen, analyze, log, reply.
