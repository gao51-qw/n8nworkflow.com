    "description": "## Who’s it for\n\nThis template is perfect for digital agencies, SDRs, lead generators, or outreach teams that want to automatically convert LinkedIn company profiles into high-quality cold emails. If you spend too much time researching and writing outreach messages, this workflow does all the heavy lifting for you.\n\n---\n\n## What it does\n\nOnce a LinkedIn company profile URL is submitted via a web form, the workflow:\n1. Scrapes detailed company data using **Dumpling AI**\n2. Enriches the contact (email, name, country) using **Dropcontact**\n3. Sends company data and contact info to **GPT-4**, which generates:\n   - A personalized subject line (max 8 words)\n   - A short HTML cold email (4–6 sentences)\n4. Sends the cold email via **Gmail**\n5. Logs the lead details to **Airtable** for tracking\n\nAll AI-generated content follows strict formatting and tone guidelines, ensuring it's professional, human, and clean.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Form Trigger**: Collects the LinkedIn URL  \n2. **Dumpling AI**: Extracts company name, description, size, location, website, etc.  \n3. **Dropcontact**: Finds the contact's email and name based on enriched company details  \n4. **GPT-4**: Writes a structured cold email and subject line in JSON format  \n5. **Gmail**: Sends the personalized email to a fixed recipient  \n6. **Airtable**: Logs the lead into a specified base/table for follow-up\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- ✅ **Dumpling AI API key** (stored in HTTP header credentials)  \n- ✅ **Dropcontact API key**  \n- ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4 credentials**  \n- ✅ **Gmail account** (OAuth2)  \n- ✅ **Airtable** base & table set up with at least these fields:\n  - `Name`\n  - `LinkedIn Company URL`\n  - `People`\n  - `website`\n\n---\n\n## How to customize\n\n- Modify the GPT prompt to reflect your brand tone or service offering  \n- Replace Gmail with Slack, Outlook, or another communication tool  \n- Add a “review and approve” step before sending emails  \n- Add logic to avoid duplicates (e.g., check Airtable first)\n\n---\n\n&gt; This workflow lets you go from LinkedIn profile to inbox-ready cold email in less than a minute—with full AI support.\n",

At Schneider Electric we have a real understanding of the effect we have on our ecosystems and stakeholders. “We are both a solution provider and diligent in-house practitioner,” he adds.\n\nDigitalization, AI, climate change, energy transition, the evolution of global wealth and balance… these are our next frontiers.

At Schneider Electric, we believe marketing plays a big part in driving adoption of sustainable innovation.\n\nTake our AirSeT medium-voltage switchgear: it replaces SF₆ – a potent greenhouse gas – with pure air, delivering the same high performance with significantly lower environmental impact. Each installation avoids 75,000 kg of CO₂e emissions and offers up to 30% savings in maintenance costs.\n\nTo accelerate adoption, marketing must:\n✅ Make sustainability core to growth for business and society\n✅ Build purposeful brands on real action to earn lasting trust\n✅ Drive innovation that meets regulations and advances sustainability\n✅ Communicate clearly and inclusively, backed by data, to inspire change\n✅ Partner strategically to amplify impact across industries\n\nDive into our story and other sustainable marketing strategies: http://spr.ly/6045AZbVH\n\n#SustainableGrowth #CMOBlueprint #MarketingWithPurpose #ImpactCompany",
