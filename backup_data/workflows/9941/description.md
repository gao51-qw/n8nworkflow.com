## Who’s it for
Freelancers, agencies, and business developers who want to monitor platforms like **Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer** for new jobs — without checking manually.

## How it works
1. The workflow starts when a **chat message** or trigger event is received.  
2. It runs an **Apify Actor** to scrape job listings from your target platform.  
3. The **dataset results** are fetched via Apify’s API.  
4. A **JavaScript Code node** processes and filters the results for relevant jobs.  
5. The data is saved to **Google Sheets** for tracking and reporting.  
6. A formatted job summary is created and sent as a **WhatsApp message** directly to your phone.
