  "description": "## 📘 Description\n This workflow performs automated inventory reconciliation between Notion (physical counts) and Airtable (system counts), ensuring both databases stay synchronized.\n It fetches records from both systems, merges them into a unified comparison payload, validates the structure, and calculates discrepancies.\n If a mismatch is detected, the workflow automatically updates Airtable with the corrected count and notifies the operations team on Slack.\n If everything matches, a simple “No action needed” Slack message is sent.\n Any malformed or incomplete payloads are logged into Google Sheets for audit tracking.\n\n## ⚙️ What This Workflow Does (Step-by-Step)\n\n🟢 Manual Trigger – Execute Workflow\n Starts the reconciliation process on demand.\n\n📥 Fetch Records from Notion\n Retrieves physical stock data (cycle count) stored in Notion.\n\n📦 Fetch Records from Airtable\n Loads inventory data from Airtable’s system-of-record table.\n\n🔀 Merge Notion + Airtable Inputs\n Combines both datasets into a single payload for unified processing.\n\n🔍 Validate Payload Structure (IF Node)\n Ensures that key fields (like id) exist.\n Valid → continue\n Invalid → logged to Google Sheets.\n\n🧾 Log Invalid Versioning Requests to Google Sheets\n Stores broken or incomplete payload entries for later review.\n\n🧮 Build Combined Notion + Airtable Payload (Code Node)\n Constructs the structured comparison object:\n{ notion: {...}, airtable: [...] }\n\n📊 Compare Notion Record With Airtable Record (Code Node)\n Performs core reconciliation logic:\nMatches items by name\nCompares physical vs. system count\nCalculates difference\nDetermines if a correction is needed\nIf mismatch → flagged for update.\n\n🔎 Check If Record Requires Update (IF Node)\n Branches logic into:\nMismatch → Update Airtable + Alert\nMatch → No action summary\n\n🛠️ Update Airtable Record With Corrected Count\n Writes the accurate physical count from Notion into Airtable.\n\n🧠 Configure GPT-4o – Slack Summary Models\n Two models:\nFor “no action needed” summaries\nFor “Airtable updated” discrepancy alerts\n\n🤖 Generate Slack Summary / Generate Slack Summary1\n AI produces short, precise, operations-friendly Slack messages based on whether a discrepancy existed.\n\n💬 Slack – Send Summary Notification / Send Update Notification\n Sends final Slack message to the operations user, confirming:\nStock match status\nUpdates made\nItem details\nDifference values\n\n## 🧩 Prerequisites\n- Notion API integration\n- Airtable API credentials\n- Azure OpenAI GPT-4o\n- Slack API connection\n- Google Sheets OAuth\n\n## 💡 Key Benefits\n ✔ Eliminates manual reconciliation errors\n ✔ Keeps Airtable continuously aligned with real physical counts\n ✔ Provides instant Slack visibility to operations teams\n ✔ Logs all invalid or malformed cases\n ✔ Centralizes Notion + Airtable consistency checks\n\n## 👥 Perfect For\n-  Operations teams managing multi-system inventory\n-  Warehouse cycle count workflows\n-  Audit-driven companies needing accurate stock data\n-  Businesses using Notion + Airtable as parallel systems",
