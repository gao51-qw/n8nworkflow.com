  "description": "# YouTube Shorts Automation with AI-Powered Video Generation\n\n## Overview\n\nThis workflow automates the creation of engaging YouTube Shorts by leveraging AI tools to generate scripts, audio, images, and videos, then compiles them into a final video ready for upload. It uses OpenAI for script and image prompt generation, ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, Replicate for image and video generation, Cloudinary for audio storage, and Creatomate for final video rendering. The workflow segments the script into 6-second clips, creates corresponding visuals, and combines them with audio, adding smooth transitions for a polished result.\n\n## Why is this workflow useful?\n\nCreating YouTube Shorts manually is time-consuming, requiring scriptwriting, voiceovers, and video editing. This workflow automates the entire process, enabling creators to produce high-quality, engaging Shorts in minutes. It’s ideal for content creators, marketers, or businesses looking to maintain a consistent social media presence with minimal effort.\n\n## Who is this workflow for?\n\n- **Content Creators**: YouTubers or TikTok creators aiming to produce viral Shorts quickly.\n- **Digital Marketers**: Businesses promoting products or services through short-form video content.\n- **Hobbyists**: Individuals experimenting with AI-driven video production without advanced editing skills.\n\n## What will you need to use this workflow?\n\n- **n8n Account**: Free or paid, hosted on n8n Cloud or self-hosted.\n- **OpenAI API Key**: For generating scripts and image prompts (GPT-4o-mini model).\n- **ElevenLabs API Key**: For text-to-speech conversion.\n- **Replicate API Key**: For generating images and videos.\n- **Cloudinary Account**: For storing audio files.\n- **Creatomate API Key**: For rendering the final video.\n- **Basic JSON Knowledge**: To understand and tweak the workflow output if needed.\n\n## How does this workflow work?\n\n1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts manually via the \"Test Workflow\" button.\n2. **Script Generation**: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) generates a script with an intro (40-70 chars), base (280-350 chars), and CTA (55 chars), plus a title and description with hashtags.\n3. **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs converts the script into an MP3 audio file with timestamps.\n4. **Audio Upload**: The audio is uploaded to Cloudinary for storage.\n5. **Script Segmentation**: A Python script segments the audio into 6-second clips, creating transcription chunks.\n6. **Image Prompt Generation**: OpenAI generates a visual prompt for each segment in the style of CNSTLL, ensuring simple, animatable visuals.\n7. **Image Generation**: Replicate creates a 9:16 image for each segment based on the prompt.\n8. **Video Generation**: Replicate’s Minimax model generates 5-second video clips from the images.\n9. **Video Compilation**: Creatomate combines the video clips with the audio, adding fade transitions and a final black shape for a smooth close.\n10. **Final Output**: The rendered video is retrieved from Creatomate, ready for YouTube Shorts.\n\n## Setup instructions\n\n1. **Import the Workflow**: Copy the provided JSON into n8n and import it as a new workflow.\n2. **Add Credentials**:\n   - Configure OpenAI API credentials for the \"Ideator\" and \"Image Prompter\" nodes.\n   - Set up ElevenLabs API key in the \"Script Generator\" node.\n   - Add Replicate API key for the \"Request Image,\" \"Request Video,\" and \"Get Video\" nodes.\n   - Configure Cloudinary credentials for the \"Upload to Cloudinary\" node.\n   - Set Creatomate API key for the \"Editor\" and \"Get Final Video\" nodes.\n3. **Test the Workflow**:\n   - Click \"Test Workflow\" to run it manually.\n   - Replace `&lt;user-query&gt;` in the \"Ideator\" node with your video topic (e.g., \"Fitness tips for beginners\").\n4. **Verify Outputs**: Check each node’s output, ensuring audio, images, and videos are generated correctly.\n5. **Customize (Optional)**:\n   - Adjust segment duration in the \"HTTP Request\" node’s Python code (default: 6 seconds).\n   - Modify fade duration or video resolution in the \"Create Editor JSON\" node.\n6. **Save and Activate**: Save the workflow and activate it for regular use.\n\n## Tips for getting the most out of this workflow\n\n- **Optimize Prompts**: Use specific, concise queries in the \"Ideator\" node for better script quality (e.g., \"Minimalist home decor ideas\").\n- **Check API Limits**: Ensure your API accounts (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Replicate, Creatomate) have sufficient credits.\n- **Experiment with Styles**: Tweak the CNSTLL style in the \"Image Prompter\" node for unique visuals, but keep prompts simple to avoid AI generation errors.\n- **Monitor Rendering Time**: Video rendering in Creatomate may take up to 70 seconds; adjust the \"Rendering\" node’s wait time if needed.\n- **Add Hashtags**: Enhance the generated description with trending hashtags like #YouTubeShorts, #AI, or niche-specific tags.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Error in Script Generation**: Verify your OpenAI API key and ensure the query is clear.\n- **Audio Issues**: Check ElevenLabs API key and confirm the script length fits within API limits.\n- **Image/Video Failures**: Ensure Replicate API key is valid and prompts are simple (avoid complex scenes or humans).\n- **Rendering Errors**: Confirm Creatomate API key and check JSON structure in the \"Create Editor JSON\" node.\n- **Contact Support**: Reach out to n8n Community Forum or respective API providers for persistent issues.\n\n## Built with\n\n- **n8n Nodes**: Manual Trigger, OpenAI, HTTP Request, Set, Split Out, Aggregate, Merge, Wait.\n- **External Services**: OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini), ElevenLabs (Multilingual v2), Replicate (Flux-Cinestill, Minimax Video-01), Cloudinary, Creatomate.\n- **Custom Code**: Python for audio segmentation and JSON rendering.\n\n## Example output\n\nFor a query like \"Morning routine hacks\":\n\n- **Script**:\n  - **Intro**: \"Struggling to start your day right?\"\n  - **Base**: \"Try these 3 morning hacks: 5-min meditation to clear your mind, a quick stretch routine to boost energy, and a cold shower to stay alert. Set your day up for success!\"\n  - **CTA**: \"Save this and try it tomorrow!\"\n- **Title**: \"3 Morning Hacks You NEED to Try!\"\n- **Description**: \"Kickstart your day with these easy hacks! 🧘‍♀️🚿 #MorningRoutine #Productivity #YouTubeShorts\"\n- **Video**: A 15-second Short with three 5-second clips (meditation scene, stretching POV, cold shower close-up), synced with audio and fade transitions.\n\n",
