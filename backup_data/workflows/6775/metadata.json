  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## What It Does\nThis workflow automatically discovers recently seed-funded startups by monitoring RSS feeds for funding announcements. It uses Bright Data to scrape full article content, then extracts structured company information using OpenAI (GPT). The data is exported to an Excel sheet on OneDrive, providing sales teams with a real-time list of qualified leads without any manual effort.\n\n## How It Works\n1. **Trigger & Article Discovery**:  Monitors curated RSS feeds for articles mentioning seed funding and triggers the workflow on new article detection.\n2. **Content Scraping & Preparation**: Scrapes full article content and converts it into clean markdown format for AI processing.\n3. **Data Extraction with AI**: Uses OpenAI to extract structured details like company name, website, LinkedIn profile, founders, and funding amount.\n4. **Structured Data Output & Storage**: Appends extracted data to an Excel sheet on OneDrive via Microsoft Graph API.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- **RSS Feed URL**: A valid RSS feed source that provides seed funding articles for startups.\n- **Bright Data Credentials**: Active Bright Data account with access credentials (API token ) to enable article scraping.\n- **OpenAI API Key**: An OpenAI account with an API key and access to GPT-4.1-MINI models for data extraction.\n- **Microsoft OAuth2 API Credentials**: OAuth2 credentials (Client ID, Secret, Tenant ID) with access scopes to use Microsoft Graph API for Excel integration.\n- **Excel Sheet in SharePoint**: A pre-created Excel file hosted on OneDrive or SharePoint with the following column headers:\n`createdAt`, `companyName`, `companyWebsite`, `companyLinkedIn`, `fundingAmount`, `founderName`, `founderLinkedIn`, `articleLink`\n- **Excel File & Sheet Identifiers**: The Drive ID, File ID and Sheet ID of your Excel sheet stored on OneDrive or SharePoint, required by the Microsoft Graph API for appending rows using the HTTP node in n8n.\n\nNeed help with the setup?
