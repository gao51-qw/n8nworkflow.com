  "description": "![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhtpkobg1/image/upload/v1757689724/logo_blurit_vxo83w.png)\n\n### This n8n template demonstrates how to use [Blurit](https://blurit.io) to anonymize faces and/or license plates in images or videos directly within your workflow.\n\nUse cases include: automatically anonymizing dashcam videos, securing photos before sharing them publicly, or ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.\n\n### How it works\n* The workflow starts with a **Form Trigger** where you can upload your image or video file.\n* An **HTTP Request** node authenticates with the BlurIt API using your Client ID and Secret.\n* The file is then uploaded to BlurIt via an **HTTP Request** to create a new anonymization task.\n* A polling loop checks the task status until it succeeds.\n* Once complete, the anonymized media is retrieved and saved using a **Write Binary File** node.\n\n### How to use\n* Replace the placeholder credentials in the **Set Auth Config** node with your BlurIt Client ID and Secret (found in your [BlurIt Developer Dashboard](https://app.blurit.io/account/developer)).\n* Execute the workflow, open the provided form link, and upload an image or video.\n* The anonymized file will be written to your chosen output directory (or you can adapt the workflow to upload to cloud storage).\n\n### Requirements\n* A [BlurIt](https://blurit.io) account and valid API credentials (Client ID & Secret).\n* A running instance of n8n (cloud or self-hosted).\n* (Optional) Access to a shared folder or cloud storage service if you want to automate file delivery.\n\n### Need Help?\nContact us at support@blurit.io,  \nor visit the [BlurIt Documentation](https://doc-api.blurit.io/n8n-integration).\n\nHappy Coding!\n",
