## Who’s it for

This template is perfect for SEO writers, niche bloggers, and content marketers who want to generate high-quality blog posts from a single keyword without spending hours on research and writing.

## What it does

The workflow takes a **keyword**, performs a Google search using **Dumpling AI**, analyzes the top-ranking pages and People Also Ask (PAA) questions, and then uses **GPT-4** to generate a detailed blog post based on the most valuable question. The blog draft is sent for approval via email, and once approved, it’s automatically published to **WordPress**.

Here’s what happens step by step:  
1. Receives a keyword through a simple form  
2. Uses **Dumpling AI** to perform a Google search and extract:  
   - Top 2 organic search results  
   - People Also Ask (PAA) questions and answers  
   - Top related searches  
3. Filters for insightful PAA questions  
4. Sends the data to **GPT-4** to generate a blog post in JSON format  
5. Emails the draft blog post for manual review and approval  
6. If approved, publishes the post automatically to WordPress

## How it works

1. **Form Trigger**: Captures the keyword input  
2. **Dumpling AI**: Searches Google and extracts SEO data including top results, PAA, and related searches  
3. **Code Node**: Processes the raw search data into a structured format for GPT-4  
4. **Filter Node**: Checks if PAA questions are available  
5. **GPT-4**: Chooses a strong PAA question and writes the blog post  
6. **Gmail**: Sends the draft blog post to your inbox for review  
7. **Approval Node**: Waits for manual approval  
8. **WordPress**: Publishes the approved post automatically
