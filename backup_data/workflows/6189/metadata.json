  "description": "This is a basic helper workflow to abstract the process of sending an alert email through Gmail.\n\nIt takes in two parameters:\n- Subject\n- Lines (as an array of lines)\n\nYou'll also need to fill in your email.\n\nNotably, all emails it sends have `❗ n8n Alert: ` prefixed to the subject line, which makes them easy to identify and highlight in an email inbox.\n\nIn Gmail, this can be done by starring all messages that come in with `❗ n8n Alert:` in the subject line, then using the Priority Inbox to push starreed messages to the top.\n\n_It's important to star the message rather than Mark As Important, because Gmail refuses to mark emails sent by automation as important._\n",
