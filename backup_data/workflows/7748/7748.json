    "description": "# Enrich Monday.com leads with AI-powered company research and personalized email drafts using Explorium MCP and GPT-4.1\n\n##  AI-Powered Lead Enrichment & Email Writer for Monday.com\n\n\n## 🚀 Overview\n\n**Stop losing deals to slow response times!**\n Transform your inbound leads into qualified opportunities with this intelligent workflow that automates lead enrichment and personalized outreach. When a new lead drops into your Monday.com board, magic happens:\n\n* 🔍 **Deep-dives** into company data using Explorium MCP's advanced intelligence engine\n* 🧠 **Analyzes** business priorities, pain points, and growth opportunities\n* 💡 **Identifies** specific AI automation use cases tailored to each company\n* ✉️ **Crafts** hyper-personalized email drafts with GPT-4.1 (under 120 words!)\n* 📊 **Enriches** your CRM with actionable insights and AI solution recommendations\n* 📧 **Saves** draft emails directly to Gmail for your review\n* 🔄 **Updates** Monday.com automatically with all the juicy insights\n\n**Perfect for sales teams, growth marketers, and BizDev pros who want to turn every lead into a conversation starter that actually converts!**\n\n## 👥 Who's it for?\n\n* B2B sales teams drowning in inbound leads\n* Growth teams needing lightning-fast lead qualification\n* BizDev professionals seeking that personal touch at scale\n* Companies rocking Monday.com as their CRM\n\n## ⚡ How it works\n\n1. **Webhook triggers** when fresh lead hits Monday.com\n2. **Company Researcher agent** unleashes Explorium MCP for company intel\n3. **Email Writer agent** crafts personalized outreach that doesn't sound like a robot\n4. **CRM Enrichment agent** adds golden nuggets of AI recommendations\n5. **Gmail integration** parks the draft in your inbox\n6. **Monday.com updates** with all the enriched goodness\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n**Time to magic:** 20 minutes\n\n**You'll need:**\n* OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4.1)\n* Explorium MCP API Key\n* Monday.com API Token\n* Gmail OAuth credentials\n* Monday.com webhook setup\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n1. Import this template into your n8n instance\n2. Hook up Monday.com webhook via \"Respond to Webhook\" node\n3. Deactivate that \"Respond to Webhook\" node (important!)\n4. Plug in your API credentials\n5. Customize agent prompts with YOUR company's secret sauce\n6. Match your Monday.com columns to the workflow\n7. Test drive with a dummy lead\n8. Hit activate and watch the magic! ✨\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n\n* Monday.com board with these columns: Company Name, Contact Name, Email, Comments\n* Explorium MCP access (for that company intelligence gold)\n* OpenAI API (GPT-4.1 model ready)\n* Gmail account (where drafts go to shine)\n\n## 🎨 Make it yours\n\n* Tweak email tone - formal, casual, or somewhere in between\n* Adjust research depth in Company Researcher\n* Add your unique value props to agent prompts\n* Connect more data sources for extra enrichment\n* Hook up other CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)\n* Add Slack alerts for hot leads 🔥\n\n## 💪 Why this rocks\n\n**Real talk:** Manual lead research is SO 2023. While your competitors are still googling companies, you're already in their inbox with an email that mentions their latest funding round, understands their tech stack, and offers solutions to problems they didn't even know you could solve.\n\nThis isn't just another \"Hi {{first_name}}\" template. It's AI that actually gets context, writes like a human, and makes your prospects think \"How did they know exactly what we need?\"\n\n**Results you can expect:**\n* Faster lead response time\n* Higher email open rates\n* Actually useful CRM data (not just \"interested in our product\")\n* Your sales team thanking you (seriously)\n\n**Built with ❤️ by:** [Elay Guez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elay-g)\n\n**Pro tip:** The more context you feed the AI agents about your business, the scarier-good the personalization gets. Don't hold back on those System Message customizations!",

The first paragraph should describe the **main use case to solve in the company in detail** and explain why it may be relevant. The second should summarize what the **company does** and any other useful GTM signals (size, growth stage, recent changes, priorities, etc.).\n\nNow generate the research summary.\n"
