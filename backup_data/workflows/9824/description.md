## 🚀 What this workflow does

- ✅ Connects to your **personal YouTube channel** via Google OAuth  
- 🔁 Fetches **all uploaded videos** automatically (with pagination)  
- 🏷 Extracts **metadata:** title, description, tags, privacy status, upload status, thumbnail, etc.  
- 🧾 Retrieves **captions (SRT format)** if available  
- 📈 Writes or updates data in your **Google Sheets** document  
- ⚙️ Can be run manually or scheduled via Cron

## 🧩 Nodes used

- **Manual Trigger** — to start manually or connect with Cron  
- **HTTP Request (YouTube API v3)** — fetches channel, uploads, and captions  
- **Code Nodes** — manage pagination and collect IDs  
- **SplitOut** — iterates through video lists  
- **Google Sheets (appendOrUpdate)** — stores data neatly  
- **If Conditions** — control data flow and prevent empty responses

## ⚙️ Setup guide

1. **Connect your Google Account**  
   - Used for both YouTube API and Google Sheets.  
   - Make sure the credentials are set up in *Google OAuth2 API* and *Google Sheets OAuth2 API* nodes.

2. **Create a Google Sheet**  
   - Add a tab named `Videos`.  
   - Add these columns:  
     ```
     youtube_id | title | description | tags | privacyStatus | uploadStatus | thumbnail | captions
     ```
   - You can also include `categoryId`, `maxres`, or `published` if you’d like.

3. **Replace the sample Sheet ID**  
   - In each Google Sheets node, open the “Spreadsheet” field and choose your own document.  
   - Make sure the sheet name matches the tab name (`Videos`).

4. **Run the workflow**  
   - Execute it manually first to pull your latest uploads.  
   - Optionally add a **Cron Trigger** node for daily sync (e.g., once per day).

5. **Check your Sheet**  
   - Your data should appear instantly — with each video’s metadata and captions (if available).

## 🧠 Notes & tips

- ⚙️ The flow loops through *all pages* of your upload playlist automatically — no manual pagination needed.  
- 🕒 The workflow uses YouTube’s *“contentDetails.relatedPlaylists.uploads”* to ensure you only fetch your own uploads.  
- 💡 Captions fetch may fail for private videos — use “Continue on Fail” if you want the rest to continue.  
- 🧮 Ideal for dashboards, reporting sheets, SEO analysis, or automation triggers.  
- 💾 To improve speed, you can disable the “Captions” branch if you only need metadata.
