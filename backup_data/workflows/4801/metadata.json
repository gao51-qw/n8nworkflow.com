  "description": "## Who is this for?\n\nMarketing, content, and enablement teams that need a **quick, human-readable summary of every new video** published by the YouTube channels they care about—without leaving Slack.\n\n## What problem does this workflow solve?\n\nManually checking multiple channels, skimming long videos, and pasting the highlights into Slack wastes time. This template **automates the whole loop**: detect a fresh upload from your selected channels → pull subtitles → distill the key take-aways with GPT-4o-mini → drop a neatly-formatted digest in Slack.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. **Schedule Trigger** fires every 10 min, then grabs a list of YouTube RSS feeds from a Google Sheet.\n2. **HTTP + XML** fetch & parse each feed; only brand-new videos continue.\n3. **YouTube API** fetches title/description, **RapidAPI** grabs English subtitles.\n4. Code nodes build an AI payload; **OpenAI** returns a JSON summary + article.\n5. A formatter turns that JSON into Slack Block Kit, and **Slack** posts it.\n6. Processed links are appended back to the “Video Links” sheet to prevent dupes.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Make a copy** of this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i3jZ_0npsEVtrMUSzGPV3Lbta3q7sArHHeNomlAuSMg/edit?usp=sharing) and connect a **Google Sheets OAuth2** credential with edit rights.\n2. **Slack App**: create → add `chat:write`, `channels:read`, `app_mention`; enable Event Subscriptions; install and store the **Bot OAuth token** in an n8n Slack credential.\n3. **RapidAPI key** for `https://yt-api.p.rapidapi.com/subtitles` (300 free calls/mo) → save as HTTP Header Auth.\n4. **OpenAI key** → save in an OpenAI credential.\n5. Add your RSS feed URLs to the “RSS Feed URLs” tab; press *Execute Workflow*.\n\n## How to customise\n\n* Adjust the schedule interval or freshness window in **“If newly published”**.\n* Swap the OpenAI model or prompt for shorter/longer digests.\n* Point the Slack node at a different channel or DM.\n* Extend the AI payload to include thumbnails or engagement stats.\n\n## Use-case ideas\n\n* **Product marketing**: Instantly brief sales & CS teams when a competitor uploads a feature demo.\n* **Internal learning hub**: Auto-summarise conference talks and share bullet-point notes with engineers.\n* **Social media managers**: Get ready-to-post captions and key moments for re-purposing across platforms.\n",
