    "description": "# YouTube Content Repurposing Automation\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis workflow is for content creators, marketers, agencies, coaches, and businesses who want to maximize their YouTube content ROI by automatically generating multiple content assets from single videos. It's especially useful for professionals who want to:\n\n- Repurpose YouTube videos into blogs, social posts, newsletters, and tutorials without manual effort\n- Scale their content production across multiple channels and platforms\n- Create consistent, high-quality content derivatives while saving time and resources\n- Build automated content systems that generate multiple revenue streams\n- Maintain active presence across social media, email, and blog platforms simultaneously\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving\n\nContent creators face significant challenges when trying to maximize their video content:\n\n**Time-intensive manual repurposing**: Converting one YouTube video into multiple content formats traditionally requires hours of manual writing, editing, and formatting across different platforms.\n\n**Inconsistent content quality**: Manual repurposing often leads to varying quality levels and missed opportunities to optimize content for specific platforms.\n\n**High costs for content services**: Hiring ghostwriters or content agencies to repurpose videos can cost thousands of dollars monthly.\n\n**Scaling bottlenecks**: Manual processes prevent creators from efficiently scaling their content across multiple channels and formats.\n\nThis workflow solves these problems by automatically extracting YouTube video transcripts, using AI to generate multiple high-quality content formats (tutorials, blog posts, social media content, newsletters), and organizing everything in Airtable for easy management and distribution.\n\n## How it works\n\n**Automated Video Processing**  \nStarts with a manual trigger and retrieves YouTube URLs from your Airtable configuration, processing only videos marked as \"selected\" while filtering out those marked for deletion.\n\n**Intelligent Transcript Extraction**  \nUses Scrape Creator API to extract video transcripts, automatically cleaning and formatting the text for optimal AI processing and content generation.\n\n**Multi-Format Content Generation**  \nLeverages OpenRouter models, o you can easily test different AI models and choose the one that delivers the best results for your needs:\n- Step-by-step tutorials with code snippets and technical details\n- YouTube scripts with hooks, titles, and conclusions\n- Blog posts optimized for lead generation\n- Structured summaries with key takeaways\n- LinkedIn posts with engagement triggers\n- Newsletter content for email marketing\n- Twitter/X posts for social media\n\n**Smart Content Filtering**  \nProcesses only the content types you've selected in Airtable, ensuring efficient resource usage and faster execution times.\n\n**Automated Content Organization**  \nMatches and combines all generated content pieces by URL, then updates your Airtable with complete, ready-to-use content assets organized by type and source video.\n\n## How to set up\n\n### Required credentials\n\n- **OpenRouter API key** \n- **Airtable Personal Access Token** \n- **[Scrape Creators API Key](Scrape Creator API key)** - For YouTube transcript extraction and processing\n\n### Airtable base setup\n\nCreate an Airtable base with one main table:\n\n**Videos Table**:\n- **title** (Single line text): Video title for reference\n- **url** (URL): YouTube video URL to process\n- **Status** (Single select): Options: \"selected\", \"delete\", \"processed\"\n- **output** (Multiple select): Content types to generate\n  - summary\n  - tutorial  \n  - blog-post\n  - linkedin\n  - newsletter\n  - tweeter\n  - youtube\n- **summary** (Long text): Generated video summary\n- **tutorial** (Long text): Generated step-by-step tutorial\n- **key_take_aways** (Long text): Extracted key insights\n- **blog_post** (Long text): Generated blog post content\n- **linkedin** (Long text): LinkedIn post content\n- **newsletter** (Long text): Email newsletter content\n- **tweeter** (Long text): Twitter/X post content\n- **youtube_titles** (Long text): YouTube video title suggestions\n- **youtube_hook** (Long text): Video opening hooks\n- **youtube_steps** (Long text): Video step breakdowns\n- **youtube_conclusion** (Long text): Video ending/CTAs\n\n### API Configuration\n\n**Scrape Creator Setup**:\n1. Sign up for Scrape Creator API\n2. Obtain your API key from the dashboard\n3. Configure the HTTP Request node with your credentials\n4. Set the endpoint to: `https://api.scrapecreators.com/v1/youtube/video/transcript`\n\n**OpenAI Setup**:\n1. Create an OpenRouter account and generate an API key\n\n### Workflow Configuration\n\n1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance\n2. Update all credential references with your API keys\n3. Configure the Airtable nodes with your base and table IDs\n4. Test the workflow with a single video URL first\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)\n- **Active API subscriptions** for OpenRouter (or the LLM or your choice), Airtable, and Scrape Creator\n- **YouTube video URLs** - Must be publicly accessible videos with available transcripts\n- **Airtable account** - Free tier sufficient for most use cases\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n### Modify content generation prompts\n\nEdit the LLM Chain nodes to customize content style and format:\n- **Tutorial node**: Adjust technical depth and formatting preferences\n- **Blog post node**: Modify tone, length, and CTA strategies\n- **LinkedIn node**: Customize engagement hooks and professional tone\n- **Newsletter node**: Tailor subject lines and email marketing approach\n\n### Adjust AI model selection\n\nUpdate the OpenRouter Chat Model to use different models\n\n### Add new content formats\n\nCreate additional LLM Chain nodes for new content types:\n- Instagram captions\n- TikTok scripts\n- Podcast descriptions\n- Course outlines\n\n\n\n",

For many businesses, creating diverse social media posts, newsletters, blogs, and videos from a single YouTube clip can involve costly ghostwriting services or countless hours of manual effort. The good news: AI automation now makes it possible to streamline this process, saving you time, reducing errors, and boosting your content output—all at a fraction of the cost.\n\nIn this article, you'll discover how AI automation—specifically using tools like NA10 and Airtable—can transform a single YouTube video into a full suite of compelling content, scalable for any business or creator. Plus, you'll learn how this seamless system can be built and customized to fit your unique needs, empowering you to generate income or serve clients more effectively.\n\n---\n\n## How AI Automation Boosts Workflow Efficiency and Content Production\n\nImagine turning one YouTube video into a variety of content assets—summaries, tutorials, blog posts, social media snippets—without manual writing or editing. This shift not only accelerates your content calendar but also ensures consistency and quality across all channels.\n\n### Real-World Success Story: Saving Hours and Improving Accuracy\n\nOne of our clients—a digital marketing agency—implemented this AI-driven workflow to repurpose client videos automatically. Prior to automation, they spent over 20 hours weekly editing and adapting content manually. After adopting this system:\n\n- **Time spent on content repurposing reduced by 85%.**\n- **Manual errors decreased significantly, ensuring consistent messaging.**\n- **Content was generated faster, enabling more frequent posting and engagement.**\n\nThis resulted in a measurable increase in reach and client satisfaction, proving that automated workflows can elevate your content game while freeing your team for high-value tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Building an Automated Content Repurposing System in a Few Simple Steps\n\nThe core idea is to connect your YouTube videos to AI models via an automation platform, process transcripts, and generate tailored content assets—all stored and managed through Airtable. Here’s how it works:\n\n### 1. Structuring Your Airtable for Input and Output\n\nStart by creating a table with fields for video URL, title, status, and desired content outputs (e.g., summary, tutorial, blog post). The automation will:\n\n- Receive the YouTube URL.\n- Process the video.\n- Generate content based on your selection.\n- Save all assets back into Airtable, ready for publishing.\n\n### 2. Extracting Video Transcripts via API Requests\n\nUsing an API like NA10’s YouTube scraper, you send the video URL and request transcript data. This process:\n\n- Retrieves the speech content from the video.\n- Cleans up timestamps and irrelevant data.\n- Extracts the core transcript for further use.\n\n### 3. Generating Content with AI Language Models\n\nNext, the cleaned transcript is fed into AI language models (like GPT-4) with carefully crafted prompts to generate:\n\n- Summaries and key takeaways.\n- Step-by-step tutorials.\n- Blog posts, newsletters, or social media snippets.\n\nYou can customize prompts to produce highly tailored content, ensuring your outputs meet your specific needs.\n\n---\n\n## Quantifiable Results: How Automation Maximizes ROI\n\nImplementing this workflow can yield impressive results:\n\n| Benefit | Measurable Impact |\n|---|---|\n| **Time saved per video** | From 4 hours manually to under 15 minutes automation |\n| **Error reduction** | Eliminates manual copying mistakes, ensuring content accuracy |\n| **Content output** | Generate 3–5 different high-quality assets from a single video |\n| **Cost savings** | Reduce reliance on expensive ghostwriting or freelance services |\n| **Scalability** | Process dozens of videos weekly without additional staff |\n\nAccording to industry data, organizations adopting AI-powered content automation see a 50% increase in content volume within six months, with a significant boost in engagement and conversions.\n\n---\n\n## Build and Scale Your Own Content Automation System Today\n\nWhat if you could build such a system yourself?

            "text": "**Tutorial: How to Use NA10 and Airtable to Automate Content Repurposing from YouTube Videos**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Structuring Your Airtable\n\n- Create an Airtable base with a table that includes the following fields:\n  - **Title** (text input)\n  - **Video URL** (text input for the YouTube link)\n  - **Status** (single select; default options: \"selected\", \"processed\", \"delete\")\n  - **Output Types** (multiple select; options: Summary, Tutorial, Key Takeaways, Blog Post, Newsletter, Twitter, YouTube Titles, Hooks, Steps, Conclusion, etc.)\n  - **Delete Option** (binary/select for deletion)\n  - Additional fields for each content type you want to generate (e.g., Summary, Tutorial, Blog Post, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Starting Your Workflow\n\n- Use a **manual trigger** to initiate the automation process.\n- In your workflow, add an **AirTable node**:\n  - Select your base and table.\n  - Output all data for processing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Filtering Based on Selection\n\n- Add a **Switch node** to process only videos marked as \"selected.\"\n- Use an **AirTable node** to check the \"Status\" field:\n  - If set to **\"delete\"**, delete the record.\n  - If **\"selected\"**, proceed with processing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Extracting Video Data\n\n- Use an **Appi URL node** to prepare the API request:\n  \n```json\n{\n  \"start_urls\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE\",\n      \"method\": \"GET\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"download_subtitle\": true\n}\n```\n\n- Build the API URL for the YouTube scraper (via Appi).\n- Store the **API endpoint URL** from Appi, e.g., \"https://api.appi.com/v1/run-actor-synchronously...\"\n\n- Implement an **HTTP Request node**:\n  - Use the above API endpoint.\n  - Send the request with the body containing the video URL.\n  - Pass API credentials securely via a credential node.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Extracting and Cleaning the Transcript\n\n- Receive the API response containing the video transcript (SRT format).\n- Use an **LLM chain** node to **remove timestamps** from the transcript:\n  \n```plaintext\nPrompt example for removing timestamps:\n\"Remove all timestamps from this transcript: {{JSON subtitles SRT}}\"\n```\n\n- Pass the cleaned transcript along with video title and URL for reference.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Filtering Content Types\n\n- Use **Filter nodes** to identify which content types to generate based on the selected \"Output Types.\"\n- For each desired content piece (e.g., tutorial, blog post), proceed only if the corresponding filter matches.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Generating Content with LLMs\n\n- Use **LLM chain** Nodes for each content type:\n  - Select a model like **GPT-4**, **GPT-4 Nano**, or **GPT-3.5** based on speed/cost/quality preferences.\n  - Attach **prompt templates** explaining exactly what content you want to generate (e.g., summary, tutorial, blog post).\n  - Example prompt for a YouTube summary:\n\n```plaintext\n\"Create a detailed summary and key takeaways for the following video transcript: {{cleaned transcript}}. Return the output in structured JSON format.\"\n```\n\n- Attach a **structured output parser** to enforce JSON format and readability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Combining and Merging Content\n\n- Use a **Code node** to:\n  - Match all generated pieces of content (e.g., summary, tutorial, blog post) by URL.\n  - Combine all data into a single structured object.\n\n```javascript\n// Example code snippet for merging items\nconst items = inputItems; // Array of content pieces with URL and content\nconst merged = {};\n\nitems.forEach(item => {\n  if (!merged[item.url]) {\n    merged[item.url] = { url: item.url, title: item.title };\n  }\n  Object.assign(merged[item.url], { [item.type]: item.content });\n});\nreturn Object.values(merged);\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Mapping Back to Airtable\n\n- Use an **AirTable node** to update records:\n  - Match by **URL**.\n  - Fill in the fields for **Summary**, **Tutorial**, **Blog Post**, **Newsletters**, etc., with the generated content.\n- This step makes all content available directly within your Airtable for review or further use.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Experiment with different GPT models for balance between cost and quality.\n- Feel free to customize prompts and output structure for your specific needs.\n- This process can be scaled to handle multiple videos and different content types automatically.\n\n---\n\n### Resources:\n- [NA10 Platform](https://n8n.io/)\n- [Appi API for YouTube Scraping](https://appi.com/)\n- Use your own API keys and credentials securely within app integrations.\n\n---\n\n**Congratulations!** You've now automated the entire process of extracting, processing, and generating multiple content pieces from a YouTube video using NA10, Appi API, and Airtable.\n\n---\n\n*If you'd like to build a full stack app or learn how to monetize this system, join the [Private School Community](#) mentioned in the video for hands-on guidance.*\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Download the complete workflow template for free using the link in the video description and customize it to fit your content needs!"

Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one.\n3. Navigate to **API & Services** > **Library**.\n4. Search for **Custom Search API**.\n5. Enable the API if it’s not already enabled.\n6. Go to **Credentials** > **Create Credentials** > **API Key**.\n7. Copy the generated API key for later use.\n   \n   *Note:* The free tier provides 100 API calls per day (10 results per request × 10 pages).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Programmable Search Engine (CSE)**\n\n1. Visit [Programmable Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all).\n2. Click **Add** to create a new Search Engine.\n3. Name it as preferred (e.g., \"LinkedIn Scraper\").\n4. Under **Sites to Search**, select **\"Search the entire Web\"**.\n5. Click **Create**.\n6. After creation, go to the **Control Panel** and copy the **CX** (Search Engine ID).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Build the Automation Workflow in NA10**\n\n1. **Start with a Form Trigger**\n\n   - Create a form where you input:\n     - `Position`\n     - `Industry`\n     - `Region`\n     - `Max Pages` (limit pages to scrape, e.g., 2 for demo)\n\n2. **Extract User Inputs**\n\n   - Use a **Set** node to get:\n     - Max pages (`maxPages`)\n     - Position (`position`)\n     - Industry (`industry`)\n     - Region (`region`)\n     - Initialize `currentStartIndex` at 1\n\n3. **Make HTTP Request to Google Search API**\n\n   - Use an HTTP Request node with the endpoint:\n\n     ```\n     https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1\n     ```\n\n   - Query parameters:\n     - `key` — Your Google API key\n     - `cx` — Your Search Engine ID\n     - `q` — Constructed query string (example below)\n     - `start` — Pagination start index (starts at 1, increases by 10 per loop)\n\n   - Example of query string:\n     ```\n     site:linkedin.com/in/ AND \"<Position>\" AND \"<Industry>\" AND \"<Region>\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Configure Query Parameters**\n\n   - Set up the parameters:\n     - `key`: from Google Cloud\n     - `cx`: your search engine ID\n     - `q`: Dynamic query with input parameters\n     - `site:linkedin.com/in/` as base\n     - `start`: current `startIndex`\n\n5. **Loop for Pagination**\n\n   - After each request:\n     - Use a **Code** node to parse the results:\n       - Extract name, title, link, snippet for each profile.\n       - Store these in variables or a collection.\n     - Use a **Wait** node (5 seconds default) to respect API rate limits.\n   - Check if more pages are needed:\n     - If `currentStartIndex` + 10 <= `maxPages` * 10, then:\n       - Increment `currentStartIndex` by 10.\n       - Loop back to the HTTP request node.\n\n6. **Extract and Store Data**\n\n   - In the code node, compile all profiles into a structured array/object.\n   - Save results into a Google Sheet using a Google Sheets node (via API or NA10 integration).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Store Results in Google Sheets**\n\n- Map the extracted data:\n  - `Name`\n  - `Title`\n  - `LinkedIn URL`\n  - `Snippet`\n  - `Index` (to keep track order)\n- The Google Sheets node will update your spreadsheet with new profiles after each loop.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Handling Pagination and Loop Control**\n\n- Use code logic to:\n  - Determine if more pages are available.\n  - Continue scraping until:\n    - Reached the maximum number of pages specified.\n    - No more results are available.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Points**\n\n- You can automate up to **1,000 leads per day for free** using the free API tier:\n  - 10 results per request × up to 100 API calls (pages).\n- Use a **wait node** to avoid exceeding API rate limits.\n- Store all results dynamically in Google Sheets for further processing.\n- The entire process runs automatically, scraping data from LinkedIn profiles matching your search criteria.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Resources**\n\n- [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n- [Programmable Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all)\n- [NA10 Automation Platform](https://na10.com/)\n- **Tip:** Combine this automation with tools to enrich lead data or send automatic outreach emails.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Use this template and process responsibly, respecting Google's API terms of service and LinkedIn's data policies."
