# YouTube Content Repurposing Automation

## Who's it for

This workflow is for content creators, marketers, agencies, coaches, and businesses who want to maximize their YouTube content ROI by automatically generating multiple content assets from single videos. It's especially useful for professionals who want to:

- Repurpose YouTube videos into blogs, social posts, newsletters, and tutorials without manual effort
- Scale their content production across multiple channels and platforms
- Create consistent, high-quality content derivatives while saving time and resources
- Build automated content systems that generate multiple revenue streams
- Maintain active presence across social media, email, and blog platforms simultaneously

## What problem is this workflow solving

Content creators face significant challenges when trying to maximize their video content:

**Time-intensive manual repurposing**: Converting one YouTube video into multiple content formats traditionally requires hours of manual writing, editing, and formatting across different platforms.

**Inconsistent content quality**: Manual repurposing often leads to varying quality levels and missed opportunities to optimize content for specific platforms.

**High costs for content services**: Hiring ghostwriters or content agencies to repurpose videos can cost thousands of dollars monthly.

**Scaling bottlenecks**: Manual processes prevent creators from efficiently scaling their content across multiple channels and formats.

This workflow solves these problems by automatically extracting YouTube video transcripts, using AI to generate multiple high-quality content formats (tutorials, blog posts, social media content, newsletters), and organizing everything in Airtable for easy management and distribution.

## How it works

**Automated Video Processing**  
Starts with a manual trigger and retrieves YouTube URLs from your Airtable configuration, processing only videos marked as "selected" while filtering out those marked for deletion.

**Intelligent Transcript Extraction**  
Uses Scrape Creator API to extract video transcripts, automatically cleaning and formatting the text for optimal AI processing and content generation.

**Multi-Format Content Generation**  
Leverages OpenRouter models, o you can easily test different AI models and choose the one that delivers the best results for your needs:
- Step-by-step tutorials with code snippets and technical details
- YouTube scripts with hooks, titles, and conclusions
- Blog posts optimized for lead generation
- Structured summaries with key takeaways
- LinkedIn posts with engagement triggers
- Newsletter content for email marketing
- Twitter/X posts for social media

**Smart Content Filtering**  
Processes only the content types you've selected in Airtable, ensuring efficient resource usage and faster execution times.

**Automated Content Organization**  
Matches and combines all generated content pieces by URL, then updates your Airtable with complete, ready-to-use content assets organized by type and source video.
