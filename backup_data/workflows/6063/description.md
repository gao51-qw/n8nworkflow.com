# 🧠 ICP Scoring Agent (n8n + Explorium + LLM)

This workflow automates Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) scoring for any company using a combination of Explorium data and an LLM-driven evaluation framework.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Input**: Company name is submitted via form.
2. **Data Enrichment**: Explorium's MCP Server is used to fetch firmographic, hiring, and tech data about the company.
3. **Scoring Logic**: An AI agent (LLM) applies a 3-pillar framework to assess and score the company.
4. **Output**: A structured JSON or Google Doc summary is generated using the AgentGeeks formatter.

## 📊 Scoring System (100 points total)

| Pillar                        | Max Points |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Strategic Fit                | 40         |
| AI / Tech Readiness          | 40         |
| Engagement & Reachability    | 20         |

### 🧠 Scoring Criteria

- **Strategic Fit**: Industry, size, use case, buyer roles
- **Tech Readiness**: AI maturity, hiring trends, stack visibility
- **Reachability**: Geography, contactability, data quality

## 🎯 Verdict Scale

- 🟩 **90–100**: Ideal ICP  
- ✅ **70–89**: Good Fit  
- 🟨 **40–69**: Medium Fit
