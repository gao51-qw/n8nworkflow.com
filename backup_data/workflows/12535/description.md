This n8n workflow automatically generates professional product announcements and blog articles from your Notion content planning database.


## Who's it for & Use Cases

Product Marketers, Content Teams, Product Managers, and Founders who want to:

* Automate product announcement creation from their Notion product backlog.
* Generate SEO and AI Search/ALLMO optimized blog articles with consistent structure and brand voice
* Maintain an up to date product changelog for products with frequent udpates.
 
## How It Works

### Phase 1: Notion Trigger & Validation
1. Workflow monitors your Notion "Content Plan" database for page updates
2. Validates that the entry is marked as ready for writing
3. Checks that content type is set to "Product" (filters other content types)

### Phase 2: AI Outline Generation
1. GPT-5 Mini creates a structured outline based on:
   - Project name from Notion
   - Notes field (context/instructions)
   - Built-in SEO and ALLMO best practices
2. Output includes sections, subsections, and key talking points

### Phase 3: Full Article Generation
1. Claude Sonnet 4.5 writes the complete product announcement using:
   - The generated outline
   - Project details from Notion
   - Expert product communications system prompt

2. Article follows structured format: headline, summary, feature sections, FAQ, CTA, and SEO metadata

### Phase 4: Google Docs Creation & Notion Update
1. Creates new Google Doc with your project name as title
2. Inserts the complete Markdown article into the document
3. Updates Notion page with Google Docs link for instant access
4. Marks the project as complete in Notion
