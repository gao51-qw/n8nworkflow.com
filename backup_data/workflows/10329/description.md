## 📊 Description
Ensure your GitHub repositories stay configuration-accurate and documentation-compliant with this intelligent AI-powered validation workflow. 🤖
This automation monitors repository updates, compares configuration files against documentation references, detects inconsistencies, and alerts your team instantly—streamlining DevOps and compliance reviews. ⚡

## What This Template Does
- Step 1: Triggers automatically on GitHub push or pull_request events. 🔄
- Step 2: Fetches both configuration files (config/app-config.json and faq-config.json) from the repository. 📂
- Step 3: Uses GPT-4o-mini to compare configurations and detect mismatches, missing keys, or deprecated fields. 🧠
- Step 4: Categorizes issues by severity—critical, high, medium, or low—and generates actionable recommendations. 🚨
- Step 5: Logs all discrepancies to Google Sheets for tracking and audit purposes. 📑
- Step 6: Sends Slack alerts summarizing key issues and linking to the full report. 💬
