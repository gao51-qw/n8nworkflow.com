  "description": "\n## Workflow Description:\n\nTurn a simple text idea into production-ready icons in seconds. With this workflow, you input a subject (e.g., “Copy”, “Banana”, “Slack Mute”), select a style (Flat, 3D, Cartoon, etc.), and off it goes.\n\nHere’s what happens:\n\n1. A form trigger collects your icon subject, style and optional background.\n3. The workflow uses an LLM to construct an optimised prompt.\n5. An image-generation model (OpenAI image API) renders a transparent-background, 400×400 px PNG icon.\n7. The icon is automatically uploaded to Google Drive, and both a download link and thumbnail are generated.\n9. A styled completion card displays the result and gives you a “One More Time” option.\n\nPerfect for designers, developers, no-code creators, UI builders and even home-automation geeks (yes, you can integrate it with Home Assistant or Stream Deck!). It saves you the manual icon-hunt grind and gives consistent visual output across style variants.\n\n## 🔧 Setup Requirements:\n\n- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- OpenAI API access (image generation enabled)\n- Google Drive credentials (write access to a folder)\n- (Optional) Modify to integrate Slack, Teams or other file-storage destinations\n\n## ✅ Highlights & Benefits:\n\n- Fully automated prompt creation → consistent icon quality\n- Transparent background PNGs size-ready for UI use\n- Saves icons to Drive + gives immediate link/thumbnail\n- Minimal setup, high value for creative/automation workflows\n- Easily extendable (add extra sizes, style presets, share via chat/bot)\n\n## ⚠️ Notes & Best-Practices:\n\n- Check your OpenAI image quota and costs - image generation may incur usage.\n- Confirm Google Drive folder permissions to avoid upload failures.\n- If you wish a different resolution or format (e.g., SVG), clone the image node and adjust parameters.\n\n",
