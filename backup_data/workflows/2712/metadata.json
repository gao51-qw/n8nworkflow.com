  "description": "This workflow creates a customizable form with a dynamic dropdown field that automatically updates its options from an external data source. \n\n### How it works\n\n- The workflow polls an external data source (Google Sheets in this example) at regular intervals\n- New values are processed and formatted for the dropdown\n- The form automatically updates with the new dropdown options\n\n### Set up steps\n\n**Configure your data source:**\n\n- Default setup uses Google Sheets \n\t- replace with credentials for your sheet\n\t- set up the update frequency\n- Or modify to use any other data source (API, database, etc.)\n\n**Adjust the form configuration:**\n\n- Customize the form title and description\n- Add or modify form fields as needed\n- The template includes the dropdown field by default\n\n**Connect form submissions:**\n\n- Use the \"Execute Workflow\" node to process form submissions\n\nThis template provides a foundation for creating dynamic forms that stay synchronized with your data sources, making it ideal for situations where dropdown options need to reflect current data.",
