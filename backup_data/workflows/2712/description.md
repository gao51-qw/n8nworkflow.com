This workflow creates a customizable form with a dynamic dropdown field that automatically updates its options from an external data source. 

### How it works

- The workflow polls an external data source (Google Sheets in this example) at regular intervals
- New values are processed and formatted for the dropdown
- The form automatically updates with the new dropdown options

### Set up steps

**Configure your data source:**

- Default setup uses Google Sheets 
	- replace with credentials for your sheet
	- set up the update frequency
- Or modify to use any other data source (API, database, etc.)

**Adjust the form configuration:**

- Customize the form title and description
- Add or modify form fields as needed
- The template includes the dropdown field by default

**Connect form submissions:**

- Use the "Execute Workflow" node to process form submissions

This template provides a foundation for creating dynamic forms that stay synchronized with your data sources, making it ideal for situations where dropdown options need to reflect current data.
