  "description": "This **n8n workflow template** is designed to **route user input to specialized agents** (like a Reminder Agent, Email Agent, etc.) using a **structured output from a language model**. Here's a complete description of what it does and how each part works:\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 **Workflow Purpose:**\n\nThis template receives a user's request via **Webhook**, processes it using an **LLM**, extracts structured data like the agent name and user query, and routes the input to the appropriate sub-workflow (agent) based on the specified agent type.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 **Workflow Breakdown:**\n\n#### 1. **Webhook (Trigger)**\n\n* Node: `Webhook`\n* Purpose: Accepts a POST request from any frontend or API source. It contains the **raw user input**.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **GPT Model (LLM Inference)**\n\n* Node: `GPT 4o Mini`\n* Purpose: Interprets the user input and determines:\n\n  * Which **agent** should handle it (e.g., \"Reminder Agent\", \"Email Agent\", etc.)\n  * The **actual user request** (in structured format)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Auto-Fixing Output Parser**\n\n* Node: `Auto-fixing Output Parser`\n* Purpose: Ensures that the output from the LLM matches the expected structure. If there's a mismatch, it automatically corrects it using a re-prompt.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Structured Output Parser**\n\n* Node: `Structured Output Parser`\n* Purpose: Converts the language model's response into a **strict JSON structure** with keys like:\n\n  * `\"Agent Name\"`\n  * `\"user input\"`\n  * `\"sessionID\"`\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Agent Router**\n\n* Node: `Switch (\"Agent Route\")`\n* Purpose: Based on `\"Agent Name\"`, it routes the input to one of the following sub-workflows:\n\n  * 📅 `Reminder Agent`\n  * 📧 `Email Agent`\n  * 🧾 `Document Agent`\n  * 🤝 `Meeting Agent`\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Sub-Workflow Call (Execute Workflow)**\n\nEach agent is implemented as a separate n8n workflow:\n\n* The input is forwarded to the selected agent.\n* For example, if `\"Agent Name\"` is `\"Reminder Agent\"`, the workflow `\"Reminder Agent\"` is called with `\"user input\"`.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Webhook Response**\n\n* After the sub-agent workflow finishes, a `Respond to Webhook` node sends the output back as an HTTP response.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Key Features:**\n\n* Fully modular and extensible\n* LLM-driven routing using **OpenRouter GPT-4o**\n* Auto-corrects structured output errors\n* Clean separation of concerns (agent logic is decoupled in sub-workflows)\n* Easily add more agents by updating the switch logic\n\n---\n\n### 📦 **Use Case Examples:**\n\n* User says: “Remind me to call my mom tomorrow.”\n  → Routed to **Reminder Agent**\n\n* User says: “Send an email to the HR team.”\n  → Routed to **Email Agent**\n\n* User says: “Schedule a meeting with John next week.”\n  → Routed to **Meeting Agent**\n\n---",
