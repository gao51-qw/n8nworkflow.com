What This Workflow Does
Automatically handles customer support emails about Shopify orders using AI. When customers email questions like "Where is my order?" or "When will it arrive?", this workflow:

-  Receives the email via Gmail trigger
-  Classifies the email to identify order-related queries (WISmo - Where Is My Order)
-  Retrieves real-time order data from your Shopify store
-  Generates a friendly, personalized response using AI
-  Sends an automatic reply directly to the customer

Key Features

✅ Smart email classification (handles only order-related queries)
✅ Real-time Shopify order lookup
✅ Natural, empathetic AI responses
✅ Fully automated - no manual intervention needed
✅ Non-order emails are filtered out automatically
