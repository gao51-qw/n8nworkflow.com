  "description": "Automatically turn your Google Calendar into a fully-automated notification system with email alerts, SMS reminders, and a live performance dashboard - all powered by n8n.\n\nThis automation helps you never miss an event, while giving you clear visibility into what notifications were sent, when, and how reliably they ran.\n\n**What This Automation Does**\n\nThis solution is built as 4 connected workflows that run on a schedule and work together:\n\n**1. Daily Email Summary (Morning)**\n\nEvery morning, the workflow:\n\n- Reads today’s events from Google Calendar\n\n- Formats them into a clean email\n\n- Sends a daily schedule summary via Mailchimp or SendGrid\n\n**2. Daily SMS Summary**\n\nShortly after, it:\n\nSends a concise SMS overview of today’s meetings using Twilio\n\n**3. 15-Minute Event Reminders**\n\nBefore each event:\n\n- Sends an individual SMS reminder\n\n- Skips all-day events automatically\n\n**4. Weekly Schedule Preview**\n\nEvery Sunday:\n\n- Sends a week-ahead summary so you can plan in advance\n\n**Live Reporting & Dashboard**\n\nAll workflow activity is logged automatically into Google Sheets, which powers a real-time analytics dashboard showing:\n\n- Number of notifications sent\n\n- Success vs failure rates\n\n- Daily and weekly execution stats\n\n- Visual charts powered by Chart.js\n\n- No manual tracking needed, everything updates automatically.\n\n**How the Workflow Is Structured**\n\nThe automation is grouped into 3 clear sections:\n\n**Section 1: Calendar Data Collection**\n\n- Pulls events from Google Calendar\n\n- Filters relevant meetings\n\n- Prepares clean event data\n\n**Section 2: Notifications & Messaging**\n\n- Formats emails and SMS messages\n\n- Sends reminders and summaries\n\n- Handles scheduling logic\n\n**Section 3: Logging & Reporting**\n\n- Saves every execution to Google Sheets\n\n- Updates daily stats automatically\n\n- Feeds the live dashboard\n\n**SUPPORT & FEEDBACK**\nQuestions or issues?
