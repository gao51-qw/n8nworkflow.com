## 🧠 How It Works – Step by Step

### 1. ⏰ Scheduled Trigger
The workflow starts at a fixed time every day (e.g., 9–10 AM) using a **Schedule Trigger**.

### 2. 📄 Read Pickup Data from Google Sheets
It fetches rows from Google Sheets where:
- **Pickup Date** = today
- **Status** = Pending

This ensures only relevant pickups are processed.

### 3. 🔁 Loop Through Pickups
Each matching row is processed individually to send customer-specific reminders.

### 4. ✍️ Generate Personalized Messages
Using a **Code node**, the workflow creates:
- 📲 A WhatsApp text message
- 📞 A voice message script

Messages include:
- Customer name
- Product name
- Pickup address
- Return reason
- Pickup timing reminder

### 5. 📲 Send WhatsApp Reminder
A personalized WhatsApp message is sent via **Twilio**, reminding the customer to keep the package ready.

### 6. 📞 Place Voice Call Reminder
If required, the workflow places an automated **voice call** using Twilio and reads out a clear pickup reminder using text-to-speech.

### 7. ✅ Update Pickup Status
Once notifications are sent:
- The workflow updates the **Status** column to **“Reminder Sent”**
- Ensures the same pickup is not notified again
