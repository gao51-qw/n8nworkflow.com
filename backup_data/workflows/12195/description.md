## How It Works
This automated disaster response workflow streamlines emergency management by monitoring multiple alert sources and coordinating property protection teams. Designed for property managers, insurance companies, and emergency response organizations, it solves the critical challenge of rapidly identifying at-risk properties and deploying resources during disasters.The system continuously monitors weather, seismic, and flood alerts from authoritative sources. When threats are detected, it cross-references property databases to identify affected locations, calculates insurance exposure, and generates damage assessments using OpenAI's GPT-4. Teams receive automated maintenance schedules while property owners and insurers get instant email notifications with comprehensive reports. This eliminates manual monitoring, reduces response time from hours to minutes, and ensures no vulnerable properties are overlooked during emergencies.
