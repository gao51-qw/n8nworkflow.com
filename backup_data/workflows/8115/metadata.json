  "title": "Automate UGC video creation with Gemini and Google Veo 3 & upload to Instagram via Postiz",
  "description": "\n🎥🤖 This workflow automates the **creation and publishing of UGC (User-Generated Content) videos** using **Google Gemini** and **Google Veo 3**, then uploads them directly to **Instagram** with [Postiz](https://postiz.com/?ref=n3witalia).\n\n---\n\n###  Advantages\n\n* ✅ **Full Automation** – Eliminates manual video editing, caption writing, and uploading.\n* ✅ **High-Quality UGC Videos** – Leverages **Google Veo 3** for professional ad-like video generation.\n* ✅ **AI-Powered Creativity** – Uses **Google Gemini** for both creative direction and social media copywriting.\n* ✅ **Time-Saving** – From image to published Instagram post in a single automated flow.\n* ✅ **Consistency** – Ensures branding and messaging remain aligned across campaigns.\n* ✅ **Scalability** – Can easily generate multiple UGC ads for different products.\n* ✅ **Centralized Management** – Stores videos in Google Drive and distributes them via Postiz.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1.  **Image Analysis & Creative Briefing:** The workflow starts with a predefined product image. This image is analyzed by Google Gemini, which acts as a \"Creative Director\" to generate a detailed, cinematic prompt describing an 8-second commercial scene based on the image's content.\n\n2.  **Parallel AI Task Execution:** The creative director's prompt is then sent to two different AI agents simultaneously:\n    *   **Video Generation:** One agent uses the prompt with **Google Veo 3** to generate the actual video file, visualizing the described scene.\n    *   **Copywriting:** The other agent, acting as a \"Social Media Manager,\" uses the same prompt to generate compelling caption copy tailored for an Instagram audience.\n\n3.  **Asset Distribution & Publishing:** The generated video is uploaded to two destinations: Google Drive for storage and the Postiz API for social media management. The AI-generated caption is prepared. Finally, all data (video information from Postiz and the caption) is merged and sent to the Postiz node, which schedules and publishes the video as a post to the connected Instagram account.\n\n---\n\n### **Set Up Steps**\n\nTo use this workflow, you need to configure the following credentials and node settings in n8n:\n\n1.  **Image Source:** In the **\"Set image\"** node, replace the default `image_url` value with the URL of your own product image.\n\n2.  **Google Gemini Credentials:** The workflow uses three Gemini nodes. Ensure your Google Gemini API credentials (named \"Google Gemini(PaLM) (Eure)\" in this example) are correctly set up and have access to the specified models (`gemini-2.5-pro` and `veo-3.0-generate-preview`).\n\n3.  **Google Drive Credentials:** Configure the **\"Upload video\"** node with valid Google Drive OAuth credentials. Update the `folderId` parameter if you wish to save the generated videos to a different folder in your Drive.\n\n4.  **Postiz Credentials:** The **\"Upload Video to Postiz\"** and **\"Instagram\"** nodes require valid credentials for the [Postiz API](https://postiz.com/?ref=n3witalia). You must have an active Postiz account and have connected your Instagram business account to it within the Postiz platform.\n\n5.  **Postiz Integration ID:** In the **\"Instagram\"** node, the `integrationId` field is specific to a connected social account within a Postiz account. You must replace this value with your own Instagram integration ID from Postiz.\n\n6.  **(Optional) Video Parameters:** You can adjust the video generation aspect ratio (e.g., `9:16` for Stories/Reels) in the `options` of the **\"Generate UGC Video\"** node.\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
