  "description": "- How it works:\nThis system functions by receiving expenses via webhook POST. It validates the data, stores it in Google Sheets, and, daily at 8 PM, generates and sends financial summaries. Automatic categorization simplifies the organization of expenses.\n\n- Set up steps:\nSetup involves creating the Google Sheet, configuring the webhook, and defining the categorization rules. The process is quick and intuitive, taking about 10-15 minutes for the system to be ready to receive your expenses.",
