### 🚀 Problem Statement
Manual news monitoring is time-consuming and often misses important articles. This template solves the challenge of automatically collecting, structuring, and storing news articles from any website for comprehensive analysis and tracking.

### 🔧 How it Works

This workflow automatically scrapes news articles from websites using AI-powered extraction and stores them in Google Sheets for analysis and tracking.

#### Key Components

- **Scheduled Trigger**: Runs automatically at specified intervals to collect fresh content
- **AI-Powered Scraping**: Uses ScrapeGraphAI to intelligently extract article titles, URLs, and categories from any news website
- **Data Processing**: Formats extracted data for optimal spreadsheet compatibility
- **Automated Storage**: Saves all articles to Google Sheets with metadata for easy filtering and analysis

### 📊 Google Sheets Column Specifications

The template creates the following columns in your Google Sheets:

| Column | Data Type | Description | Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **title** | String | Article headline and title | "'My friend died right in front of me' - Student describes moment air force jet crashed into school" |
| **url** | URL | Direct link to the article | "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglzw8y5wy5o" |
| **category** | String | Article category or section | "Asia" |
