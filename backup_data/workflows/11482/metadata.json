  "description": "## Overview\nThis n8n template automates the process of researching niche topics. It searches for a topic on Wikipedia, scrapes the relevant page using **ScrapeOps**, extracts the history or background section, and uses AI to generate a concise summary and timeline. The results are automatically saved to Google Sheets for easy content planning.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Content Creators**: Quickly gather background info for videos or articles.\n- **Marketers**: Research niche markets and product histories.\n- **Educators/Students**: Generate timelines and summaries for study topics.\n- **Researchers**: Automate the initial data gathering phase.\n\n## What problems it solves\n- **Time Consumption**: Manually reading and summarizing Wikipedia pages takes time.\n- **Blocking**: Scraping Wikipedia directly can sometimes lead to IP blocks; ScrapeOps handles this.\n- **Unstructured Data**: Raw HTML is hard to use; this workflow converts it into a clean, structured format (JSON/CSV).\n\n## How it works\n1. **Define Topic**: You set a keyword in the workflow.\n2. **Locate Page**: The workflow queries the Wikipedia API to find the correct page URL.\n3. **Smart Scraping**: It uses the [ScrapeOps Proxy API](https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/proxy-api/) to fetch the page content reliably.\n4. **Extraction**: A code node intelligently parses the HTML to find \"History\", \"Origins\", or \"Background\" sections.\n5. **AI Processing**: GPT-4o-mini summarizes the text and extracts key dates for a timeline.\n6. **Storage**: The structured data is appended to a Google Sheet.\n\n## Setup steps (~ 5-10 minutes)\n1. **ScrapeOps Account**:\n   - Register for a free API key at [ScrapeOps](https://scrapeops.io/app/register/n8n).\n   - Configure the **ScrapeOps Scraper** node with your API key.\n2. **OpenAI Account**:\n   - Add your OpenAI credentials to the **Message a model** node.\n3. **Google Sheets**:\n   - Create a Google Sheet. You can duplicate this [Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P0wZ449wVNndhSa6cJtK3VA3Aulv1k18zdpwWYY13gE/edit?gid=0#gid=0) (copy the headers).\n   - Connect your Google account to the **Append row in sheet** node and select your new sheet.\n\n## Pre-conditions\n- An active ScrapeOps account.\n- An OpenAI API key (or another LLM credential).\n- A Google account for Sheets access.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThis template uses ScrapeOps as a community node. You are responsible for complying with Wikipedia's Terms of Use, robots directives, and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Scraping targets may change at any time; adjust render/scroll/wait settings and parsers as needed. Use responsibly for legitimate business purposes.",
