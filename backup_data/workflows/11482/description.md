## Overview
This n8n template automates the process of researching niche topics. It searches for a topic on Wikipedia, scrapes the relevant page using **ScrapeOps**, extracts the history or background section, and uses AI to generate a concise summary and timeline. The results are automatically saved to Google Sheets for easy content planning.

## Who is this for?
- **Content Creators**: Quickly gather background info for videos or articles.
- **Marketers**: Research niche markets and product histories.
- **Educators/Students**: Generate timelines and summaries for study topics.
- **Researchers**: Automate the initial data gathering phase.

## What problems it solves
- **Time Consumption**: Manually reading and summarizing Wikipedia pages takes time.
- **Blocking**: Scraping Wikipedia directly can sometimes lead to IP blocks; ScrapeOps handles this.
- **Unstructured Data**: Raw HTML is hard to use; this workflow converts it into a clean, structured format (JSON/CSV).

## How it works
1. **Define Topic**: You set a keyword in the workflow.
2. **Locate Page**: The workflow queries the Wikipedia API to find the correct page URL.
3. **Smart Scraping**: It uses the [ScrapeOps Proxy API](https://scrapeops.io/docs/n8n/proxy-api/) to fetch the page content reliably.
4. **Extraction**: A code node intelligently parses the HTML to find "History", "Origins", or "Background" sections.
5. **AI Processing**: GPT-4o-mini summarizes the text and extracts key dates for a timeline.
6. **Storage**: The structured data is appended to a Google Sheet.
