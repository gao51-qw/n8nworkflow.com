## Dungeons and Goblins — AI Telegram Voice Adventure with Persistent Memory

This n8n template demonstrates how to use an AI agent with persistent memory to run a structured, rules-driven fantasy role-playing game entirely through Telegram voice messages. The workflow acts as a Dungeon Master, narrating scenes, resolving mechanics, performing dice rolls when authorized, and explicitly saving game state between turns.

## How it works

- A player actions are provided to Telegram bot via voice messages.

- The AI agent loads the current game state from n8n memory.

- A strict system prompt enforces rules, turn flow, and narration.

- When an action requires a dice roll, the agent waits for player authorization.

- Once authorized, the AI rolls, resolves the outcome, and applies changes.

- All state updates are emitted as structured data and saved to memory.

- The request and response are processed in Groq's STT and TTS.

## Use cases

- Solo text-based fantasy campaigns

- Persistent AI-driven adventures

- Testing stateful AI agents in n8n

- Educational examples of memory-aware workflows
