This workflow automates the generation and delivery of personalized business documents (e.g., **contracts, job offers, invoices, pay slips**) in **PDF format**. The data source is a **Google Sheet**, and the documents are created using CraftMyPDF, then uploaded to Google Drive and optionally sent via email.

This workflow **is ideal for bulk document generation (contracts, invoices, etc.) with minimal manual intervention**.

###  Benefits

* **Fully Automated**: Once triggered, it handles the whole pipeline end-to-end—no manual editing or document creation needed.
* **Customizable**: Works with any type of business document as long as you provide a CraftMyPDF template.
* **Scalable**: Processes multiple entries in batch, ideal for HR departments or finance teams.
* **Integrated**: Seamlessly connects Google Sheets, CraftMyPDF, Google Drive, and Gmail.
* **Trackable**: Updates the original spreadsheet to keep track of which documents have been processed.

###  Requirements

* Self-hosted n8n instance (required for some advanced node usage).
* Google Sheet template with columns like: `FIRST NAME`, `LAST NAME`, `ADDRESS`, etc.
* A CraftMyPDF account with a ready-made template.
* Google OAuth2 credentials for Sheets, Drive, and Gmail integrations.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Trigger & Data Fetch**:  
   - The workflow starts with a manual trigger ("When clicking ‘Execute workflow’").  
   - It retrieves employee data from a Google Sheet ("Get employees"), filtering rows where the "DONE" column is empty.  

2. **PDF Generation & Processing**:  
   - The "Loop Over Items" node processes each employee record individually.  
   - The "Create agreement" node uses CraftMyPDF to generate a PDF contract, populating it with employee details (name, address, email, etc.).  
   - A conditional node ("Success?") checks if PDF creation was successful.  

3. **PDF Handling & Notifications**:  
   - The PDF is fetched ("Get agreement") and uploaded to Google Drive ("Upload agreement") with a filename like `[First-Name]-[Last-Name].pdf`.  
   - An email with the PDF attachment is sent to the employee via Gmail ("Send email with PDF").  

4. **Tracking & Completion**:  
   - The Google Sheet row is updated with "x" in the "DONE" column ("Update row") to mark completion.  
   - The workflow merges results and loops until all records are processed.

### **Set Up Steps**  
1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Use the **self-hosted version of n8n** (required for this workflow).  
   - Clone the provided [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQPuoEubRHJepRKdquks69Iqf2XdGVKfpWOdYwk3RMg/edit?usp=sharing).  

2. **Configure CraftMyPDF**:  
   - Create an account on [CraftMyPDF](https://app.craftmypdf.com/).  
   - Design a PDF template and note its **Template ID**. Insert this ID in the "Create agreement" node.  

3. **Credentials Setup**:  
   - Connect nodes to:  
     - Google Sheets (to fetch/update data).  
     - Google Drive (to store PDFs).  
     - Gmail (to send emails).  
     - CraftMyPDF (for PDF generation).  

4. **Customization**:  
   - Adjust field mappings in the "Create agreement" node to match your PDF template placeholders.  
   - Modify the email template in "Send email with PDF" as needed.  

5. **Execution**:  
   - Run the workflow manually. It will process all rows lacking a "DONE" marker, generating PDFs, sending emails, and updating the sheet automatically.
