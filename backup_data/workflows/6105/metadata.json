  "description": "## Description\n\nThis workflow automates the process of scraping Google Events data using SerpApi and organizing it in Google Sheets for analysis and tracking.\n\n## Who's it for\n- **Event organizers** who need to monitor competitor events in their area\n- **Marketing teams** tracking local events for partnership opportunities\n- **Researchers** collecting event data for analysis\n- **Business owners** monitoring industry events and conferences\n\n## How it works\nThe workflow searches Google Events using SerpApi's Google Events engine, processes the returned data, and saves it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It handles pagination automatically to collect multiple events and flattens the nested API response into a structured format.\n\n## What it does\n1. **Configures search parameters** - Sets the search query, total events to fetch, and pagination settings\n2. **Fetches events via SerpApi** - Makes paginated requests to Google Events API with proper rate limiting\n3. **Processes and flattens data** - Transforms nested event data into a flat structure with all relevant fields\n4. **Saves to Google Sheets** - Appends the processed events to a Google Sheets document for easy analysis\n\n## Requirements\n- **SerpApi account** with API key ([Get one here](https://serpapi.com/))\n- **Google Sheets API access** (OAuth2 credentials)\n- **Google Sheets document** - Make a copy of [this template sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DQo3tI8yKzCbLn-DWN2hureHgwj1XxvM1ogES1_77ts/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configure SerpApi credentials** in the HTTP Request node\n2. **Set up Google Sheets OAuth2** authentication\n3. **Update the Google Sheets document ID** in the final node to point to your copy\n4. **Modify search parameters** in the \"Set Search Parameters\" node:\n   - Change `query` to your desired search terms\n   - Adjust `total_events` (10 events per page)\n   - Set `start` position for pagination\n5. **Run the workflow** using the manual trigger\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- **Search terms**: Modify the query in the Set node (e.g., \"conferences in New York\", \"music events Los Angeles\")\n- **Event count**: Adjust `total_events` to fetch more or fewer events\n- **Output format**: Modify the Google Sheets column mapping to include/exclude specific fields\n- **Rate limiting**: Adjust the `requestInterval` in the HTTP Request node if needed\n- **Scheduling**: Replace the Manual Trigger with a Schedule Trigger for automated runs\n\n## Output data includes\n- Event title, description, and direct link\n- Start date and timing information\n- Venue and address details\n- Ticket information and pricing\n- Event location map links\n- Event images\n- Original search query for tracking\n\n**Note**: This workflow respects SerpApi rate limits with built-in delays between requests and processes up to 10 events per API call efficiently.",
