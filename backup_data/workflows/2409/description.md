## Who might benfit from this workflow?
Everyone organizing him/herself by using a notion database for tasks but losing track on some important tasks having a deadline. The weekly reminder helps you to not forget about your notion tasks.

## How it works:
- The workflow fetches all your notion tasks from a desired database but the closed ones
- It generates a html template for each tasks containing a headline and a short list of key data (prio, status deadline, tags)
- It creates two groups based on the deadline date if a task is already overdue or not
- It generates a complete html email containing both groups and some sugar around them
- It sends the email to your desired email
- It uses Pushover to send you a push notification to your phone
- It is scheduled by the beginning of each week

## How to set it up:
- Fill out the "Set Workflow vars" node with your data
- Connect your notion account and select the database your tasks are stored at
- define the status filters to the ones you are using for your tasks
- Setup your email server to enable the email node to deliver your html email
- Create a Pushover account and setup the authentication for the Pushover node
- Adjust the last html node to change email style for your desire

## How to customize this workflow for your needs?
- You might adjust the filtering of the notion fetch node to filter for other statuses than provided in the example.
- You apply your custom design to the html email
- You could remove the filter which is filtering for tasks having a deadline and just send yourself a reminder for all tasks
