  "description": "## Who might benfit from this workflow?\nEveryone organizing him/herself by using a notion database for tasks but losing track on some important tasks having a deadline. The weekly reminder helps you to not forget about your notion tasks.\n\n## How it works:\n- The workflow fetches all your notion tasks from a desired database but the closed ones\n- It generates a html template for each tasks containing a headline and a short list of key data (prio, status deadline, tags)\n- It creates two groups based on the deadline date if a task is already overdue or not\n- It generates a complete html email containing both groups and some sugar around them\n- It sends the email to your desired email\n- It uses Pushover to send you a push notification to your phone\n- It is scheduled by the beginning of each week\n\n## How to set it up:\n- Fill out the \"Set Workflow vars\" node with your data\n- Connect your notion account and select the database your tasks are stored at\n- define the status filters to the ones you are using for your tasks\n- Setup your email server to enable the email node to deliver your html email\n- Create a Pushover account and setup the authentication for the Pushover node\n- Adjust the last html node to change email style for your desire\n\n## How to customize this workflow for your needs?\n- You might adjust the filtering of the notion fetch node to filter for other statuses than provided in the example.\n- You apply your custom design to the html email\n- You could remove the filter which is filtering for tasks having a deadline and just send yourself a reminder for all tasks\n\n---\n### You need help implementing this or any other n8n workflow?\nFeel free to contact me via LinkedIn or [my business website](https://www.unitize.de).\n\n### You want to start using n8n?\nUse this link to [register for n8n](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/edr9c63lw12z)\n(This is an affiliate link)\n\n---",
