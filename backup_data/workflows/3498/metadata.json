  "description": "### This n8n template demonstrates how you can leverage existing support site search to power your Support Chatbots and agents.\n\nBuilding a support chatbot need not be complicated! If building and indexing vector stores or duplicating data isn't necessarily your thing, an alternative implementation of the [RAG](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) approach is to leverage existing knowledge-bases such as support portals. In this way, document management and maintenance of your support agent is significantly reduced.\n\n**Disclaimer: This template example uses AcuityScheduling's help center website but is not associated, supported nor endorsed by the company.**\n\n### How it works\n* A simple AI agent is connected with chat trigger to receive user queries.\n* The AI agent is instructed to fetch information from the knowledge-base via the attached custom workflow tool (aka \"knowledgebase tool\").\n* There is no step to replicate the entire support articles database into a vector store. You may choose not too because of time, cost and maintainence involved.\n* Instead, the tool leverages the existing support portal's search API to retrieve knowledge-base articles.\n* Finally, the search results are formatted before sending an aggregated response back to the agent.\n\n### How to use?\n* Customise the subworkflow to work with your own support portal API and format accordingly.\n* Try the following queries\n  * How do I connect my icloud to acuityScheduling?\n  * How do I download past invoices for my Acuity account?\n\n### Requirements\n* OpenAI for LLM.\n* If your organisation's APIs require authorisation, you may need to add custom credentials as necessary.\n\n### Customising this workflow\n* Add additional tools to reach other parts of your internal knowledgebase.\n* Not using OpenAI? Feel free to swap but ensure the LLM has tools/function calling support.",
