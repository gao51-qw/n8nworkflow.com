  "description": "# AI-Powered HR Candidate Evaluation Agent with LinkedIn Data Enrichment in CSV/XLSX Format\n\n## 🎯 Overview\n\nTransform your manual hiring process into an intelligent evaluation system that saves 15-20 minutes per candidate! This workflow automates the entire candidate assessment pipeline - from CSV/XLSX upload to AI-powered scoring with LinkedIn insights.\n\nWhen you upload a candidate list, this workflow automatically:\n- 📊 Converts your file into a formatted Google Sheet with RTL support\n- 🔍 Researches each candidate's recent LinkedIn posts via Apify\n- 🤖 Evaluates candidates using GPT-4.1 with context-aware scoring (0-100)\n- 💬 Generates professional Hebrew explanations for each score\n- 📈 Auto-sorts by score and applies professional formatting\n- ⚠️ Sends error alerts to keep everything running smoothly\n\n**Cost per candidate: ~$0.05** | **Time saved: 15-20 minutes each**\n\n## 👥 Who's it for?\n\n- HR teams drowning in candidate applications\n- Recruitment agencies needing consistent evaluation criteria  \n- Hiring managers seeking data-driven candidate insights\n- Companies looking to scale their team\n- Anyone tired of manual spreadsheet juggling\n\n## ⚡ How it works\n\n1. **Form submission** triggers with CSV/XLSX upload\n2. **Google Drive** stores the file and creates a new Sheet\n3. **Data extraction** processes the file content\n4. **AI Agent** loops through each candidate:\n   - Fetches up to 3 recent LinkedIn posts via Apify\n   - Analyzes qualifications against job requirements\n   - Generates evaluation score and Hebrew explanation\n5. **Sheet formatting** applies filters, sorting, and styling\n6. **Error handling** notifies admin of any issues\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n**Time to deploy: 15 minutes**\n\n### Requirements:\n- Google account (Drive + Sheets access)\n- OpenAI API key (GPT-4.1 access)\n- Apify API key (for LinkedIn scraping)\n- Gmail account (for error notifications)\n\n### Step-by-step:\n1. Import this template into your n8n instance\n2. Configure Google credentials:\n   - Connect Google Drive OAuth2\n   - Connect Google Sheets OAuth2\n3. Add OpenAI API key to the GPT-4.1 node\n4. Set up Apify credentials for LinkedIn scraping\n5. Configure Gmail for error alerts (update email in \"Send a message\" node)\n6. Update folder IDs in Google Drive nodes to your folders\n7. Test with a sample CSV containing 2-3 candidates\n8. Activate and share the form URL with your team!\n\n## 📋 Input File Format\n\nYour CSV/XLSX should include these columns (Hebrew):\n- שם פרטי (First name)\n- שם משפחה (Last name)  \n- חשבון לינקדאין (LinkedIn URL)\n- Your custom evaluation questions\n\n## 🎨 Customization Options\n\n### Easy tweaks:\n- **Scoring criteria**: Modify the AI agent's system message\n- **Language**: Switch from Hebrew to any language\n- **Scoring rubric**: Adjust the 50/25/15/10 weighting\n- **LinkedIn posts**: Change from 3 posts to more/fewer\n- **Sheet styling**: Customize colors and formatting\n\n### Advanced modifications:\n- Add integration with your ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)\n- Connect to Slack for real-time notifications\n- Add multiple evaluation agents for different roles\n- Implement multi-language support\n- Add candidate email automation\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n- **Better LinkedIn data**: Ensure candidates provide complete LinkedIn URLs (not just usernames)\n- **Consistent scoring**: Run batches of similar roles together for normalized scoring\n- **Cost optimization**: Adjust Apify settings to fetch only essential data\n- **Scale smartly**: Process in batches of min 10-20 for optimal performance\n\n## ⚠️ Important Notes\n\n- LinkedIn scraping respects Apify's rate limits\n- Scores are relative within each batch - don't compare across different job roles\n- The workflow handles both CSV and XLSX formats automatically\n- Error notifications help you catch issues before they cascade\n\n## 📊 Expected Results\n\nAfter implementation, expect:\n- Data-driven evaluation across candidates\n- Professional explanation for hiring decisions\n- Happy recruiters who can focus on human connection\n\n## Built with ❤️ by [Elay Guez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elay-g)",
