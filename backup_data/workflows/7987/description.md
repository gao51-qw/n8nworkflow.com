# Send Post‑Interview Feedback Nudges from Google Sheets to Slack (with Email Fallback)

This n8n workflow automates the process of sending post-interview feedback reminders to interviewers. It checks a Google Sheet daily for pending feedback entries and sends personalized Slack DMs or email nudges based on the availability of Slack IDs. It ensures consistent follow-ups and eliminates manual tracking.

## Who’s it for

* HR and Talent Acquisition teams
* Recruitment coordinators
* Engineering/Design/Product team leads conducting interviews
* Anyone managing interview feedback collection using Google Sheets and Slack

## How it works

1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts every day at 6:00 PM using the **Schedule Trigger**.
2. **Fetch Data**: It reads a Google Sheet with interview entries via the **Google Sheets (Read Sheet)** node.
3. **Check Feedback Submission**: An **IF node** filters entries where feedback has not been marked as “Yes.”
4. **Slack Check**: Another **IF node** checks if a valid Slack ID is present.
	* If **Slack ID exists**: Sends a Slack DM reminder.
	* If **Slack ID is missing**: Sends a fallback reminder via email using Gmail.
5. **Update Status**: Updates the sheet to mark the reminder as sent, avoiding future duplicates.

## How to set up

1. Prepare a Google Sheet with columns: `candidate_email`, `interviewer_email`, `feedback_submitted`, `slack_id`, `reminder_sent`.
2. Connect your Google Sheets, Slack, and Gmail accounts in n8n.
3. Set the Schedule Trigger to your preferred time (e.g., 6:00 PM).
4. Map the correct columns in each node.
5. Deploy and test the workflow.

## Requirements

* A working n8n instance.
* Google Sheets with structured feedback data.
* Slack workspace and bot token with DM permissions.
* Gmail account connected to n8n for fallback reminders.
* Interviewers listed with either Slack ID or valid email.

## How to customize

* Change the schedule (e.g., run hourly or on specific days).
* Customize Slack or Email message templates.
* Add conditional formatting for different interview types or roles.
* Integrate additional columns for logging timestamps or retries.
* Expand to MS Teams or other email providers.

## Add‑ons

* **Google Sheets Timestamping**: Log the exact time when reminders were sent.
* **Multi-language Reminder Support**: Based on interviewer’s preferred language.
* **Feedback Form Auto-linking**: Embed Google Form links dynamically in messages.
* **Notion or Airtable Integration**: Extend tracking to other platforms.

## Use Case Examples

* A recruiter managing 10+ interviews daily ensures feedback is collected within 24 hours.
* An engineering manager automates reminders for panelists to fill candidate scorecards.
* HR teams use it during hiring surges to eliminate feedback bottlenecks.

## Common Troubleshooting

| **Issue** | **Possible Cause** | **Solution** |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reminders not sending | Schedule Trigger not firing | Check cron expression or timezone settings |
| Slack messages not delivered | Slack ID missing or invalid | Ensure Slack IDs are mapped correctly in the Sheet |
| Emails not sent | Gmail node not authorized | Reconnect Gmail credentials in n8n |
| Entries repeatedly reminded | Sheet not updating after reminder | Confirm Update node is marking `reminder_sent` as “Yes” |
| Slack bot errors | Insufficient permissions | Ensure bot has permission to send DMs |
