## How It Works
Scheduled runs collect data from oil markets, global shipping movements, news sources, and official reports. The system performs statistical checks to detect anomalies and volatility shifts. An AI-driven geopolitical model evaluates emerging risks and assigns a crisis score. Based on severity thresholds, results are routed to the appropriate alert channels for rapid response.

## Setup Steps

1. **Data Sources:** Connect the oil price API, OPEC report feeds, shipping databases, and news sources.
2. **AI Model:** Configure the OpenRouter ChatGPT model for geopolitical and risk analysis.
3. **Alerts:** Define severity rules and route alerts to Email, Slack, or Dashboard APIs.
4. **Storage:** Configure a database for historical records, audit logging, and trend tracking.
