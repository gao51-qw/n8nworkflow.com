## 📊 Description
This workflow automates interview scheduling by orchestrating Calendly, Zoom, Asana, and Gmail into a single, reliable hiring pipeline. When a candidate books an interview, the automation ensures the interview is properly scheduled, tracked, assigned, and communicated — without any manual follow-ups.
The workflow listens for new Calendly bookings, normalizes scheduling data, creates a Zoom meeting, assigns a structured interview task in Asana, and notifies the appropriate interviewer via email. Conditional routing ensures the right stakeholders are involved while keeping candidate communications separate.
Designed for real-world hiring operations, this automation provides consistency, accountability, and scalability as interview volume grows.
