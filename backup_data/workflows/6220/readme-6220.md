# AI-powered research assistant with Linear, Scrapeless, and Claude

> ![image.png](fileId:1814)

## Brief Overview

This workflow integrates Linear, Scrapeless, and Claude AI to create an AI research assistant that can respond to natural language commands and automatically perform market research, trend analysis, data extraction, and intelligent analysis.

Simply enter commands such as /search, /trends, /crawl in the Linear task, and the system will automatically perform search, crawling, or trend analysis operations, and return Claude AI's analysis results to Linear in the form of comments.

---

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**: A user creates or updates an issue in Linear and enters a specific command (e.g. /search competitor analysis).
2. **n8n Webhook**: Listens to Linear events and triggers automated processes.
3. **Command identification**: Determines the type of command entered by the user through the Switch node (search/trends/unlock/scrape/crawl).
4. **Data extraction**: Calls the Scrapeless API to perform the corresponding data crawling task.
5. **Data cleaning and aggregation**: Use Code Node to unify the structure of the data returned by Scrapeless.
6. **Claude AI analysis**: Claude receives structured data and generates summaries, insights, and recommendations.
7. **Result writing**: Writes the analysis results to the original issue as comments through the Linear API.
