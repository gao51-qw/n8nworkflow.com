How it works
This AI Customer Success Risk Prediction workflow revolutionizes customer retention by predicting churn risk 30-90 days before it happens. Here's the high-level flow:
Daily Data Collection → AI Multi-Signal Analysis → Risk Scoring & Prediction → Smart Risk Routing → AI-Generated Personalized Interventions → CRM Updates & Team Alerts
The system automatically gathers data from your product analytics, support system, billing platform, and email tools, then uses GPT-4 to analyze patterns and predict which customers are at risk. It creates personalized intervention strategies and routes them based on urgency level.
