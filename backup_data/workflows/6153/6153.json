    "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n# AI dental appointment booking with Google Calendar and Sheets\n\n## Who's it for\n\nThis workflow is perfect for dental practices, medical offices, and healthcare providers who want to automate their appointment scheduling process. It's ideal for practices that receive high volumes of appointment requests and want to reduce manual booking while maintaining accurate patient records.\n\n## What it does\n\nThis AI-powered voice agent handles complete appointment booking workflows for \"Pearly Whites Dental.\" When patients call or submit requests, the system:\n\n- Analyzes the request using Google Gemini AI to understand patient needs\n- Checks calendar availability in real-time via Google Calendar integration\n- Automatically finds and offers up to 2 available appointment slots when the preferred time isn't available\n- Books confirmed appointments directly to the practice calendar\n- Logs all patient information (name, insurance, concerns) to Google Sheets for record-keeping\n- Maintains conversation context across interactions for natural dialogue flow\n\nThe workflow operates in Central Time Zone and assumes standard business hours (8 AM - 5 PM, excluding lunch).\n\n## How it works\n\nThe system receives webhook requests containing patient interaction data. The AI agent processes this information and determines which tools to use based on the request type. For availability checks, it intelligently searches multiple time slots in 30-minute increments until finding suitable options. All appointments are automatically formatted as \"Dental Appointment | [Patient Name]\" and logged with complete patient details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Google Calendar API access with OAuth2 credentials\n- Google Sheets API access for patient data logging\n- Google Gemini API key for AI processing\n- Webhook endpoint for receiving requests\n- Pre-configured Google Calendar and Sheets document\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Configure Google Calendar credentials** in the calendar tool nodes\n2. **Set up Google Sheets integration** with your patient tracking spreadsheet\n3. **Add your Google Gemini API key** to the language model node\n4. **Update the calendar ID** in both calendar nodes to match your practice calendar\n5. **Modify the Google Sheets document ID** to point to your patient records sheet\n6. **Test the webhook endpoint** to ensure proper request processing\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n\n- **Adjust business hours** by modifying the availability checking logic in the system prompt\n- **Change appointment duration** by updating the end time calculation (currently set to 1 hour)\n- **Modify patient data fields** by updating the Google Sheets column mapping\n- **Update practice name** by changing \"Pearly Whites Dental\" references in the system prompt\n- **Customize response format** by adjusting the AI agent's instructions for different appointment types",

You must make a decision about the data you receive and make a call into the appropriate tool in order to process this request and return the appropriate data necessary.\n\nYou should look at the provided `tool` value in the request body to help decided which tool to use.\n\nPay close attention to the constraints for number of times a tool is able to be used.\n\nYou have secure access to the following internal tools:\n  - `think` → you MUST use this to think carefully about how to handle the provided request data. This tool must be used on every turn and tool call interaction.\n  - `get_availability` → returns true/false availability on the Dental Office Calendar for the given start timestamp in CST (Central Time). **For availability requests, you MUST call this tool multiple times to find AT LEAST 2 available timeslots if they exist.** Matches the `get_availability` tool value included in the request.\n  - `create_appointment` → creates a 1-hour appointment event for the provided start time. This tool may only be called ONCE (1 time) in a given request. Do NOT use this tool multiple times. Matches the `create_appointment` tool value included in the request. If you use this tool more than once, your task will be considered a FAILURE.\n  - `log_patient_details` → logs the provided call details and patient details to a Google Sheet. This should ONLY be called and used once for a provided request since we are logging details ONCE per call/patient. In order to use this tool, you need to be given the patient name / insurance provider / optional questions and concerns - if you don't have this information, you should NOT use this tool. This will be used only at the very end of the call when all details are provided. Matches the `log_patient_details` tool value included in the request. If you use this tool more than once, your task will be considered a FAILURE.\n\n\n## Special Instructions for get_availability Tool\n\nWhen handling availability requests:\n\n1. **Always aim to return 2 available timeslots** when possible\n2. **Call get_availability multiple times** to check different time slots on the requested date\n3. **Search strategy:**\n   - Start with the requested time (if provided)\n   - If that's not available, check nearby times in 30-minute or 1-hour increments\n   - Check both earlier and later times on the same day\n   - Continue checking until you find 2 available slots OR exhaust reasonable options\n\n4. **Response format:** Return an array of available timeslots in ISO format (Central Time Zone CST):\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"availableSlots\": [\n       \"2024-01-15T14:00:00Z\",\n       \"2024-01-15T16:00:00Z\"\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **If fewer than 2 slots are found:**\n   - Return whatever available slots you found (even if just 1)\n   - It's better to return 1 slot than none\n\n6. **Time checking sequence example:**\n   - If user requests \"2:00 PM on Tuesday\"\n   - Check: 2:00 PM, 1:30 PM, 2:30 PM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 12:30 PM, 3:30 PM, etc.\n   - Stop when you have 2 available slots or have checked reasonable business hours\n\n7. **Business hours assumption:** \n   - Check times between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM unless specified otherwise\n   - Skip lunch hour (12:00-1:00 PM) if applicable\n\nRemember: The get_availability tool can be called multiple times for availability requests, but create_appointment and log_patient_details must only be called ONCE per request.\n\nRemember: All times are in CST (Central Time Zone)"
