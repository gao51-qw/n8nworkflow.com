    "description": "### ⚙ How It Works \n\nThe automated blacklist monitor is designed to be a proactive, not reactive, tool. Here is the high-level process:\n\n1.  **Scheduled Checks**: At regular intervals (e.g., every 30 minutes or every hour), a monitoring script or service sends a request to a list of predefined DNS blacklists (DNSBLs) and real-time blackhole lists (RBLs).\n2.  **Lookup Queries**: For each check, the system performs a lookup query for our specified domains and IP addresses against the various blacklists. It essentially asks, \"Is `our-ip-address.com` on your list?\"\n3.  **Status Evaluation**: The blacklist service responds with a status: either the asset is **clean** or it is **listed**.\n4.  **Alerting Mechanism**: If a **new listing** is detected, the system immediately triggers a notification. This alert contains key information like the asset that was blacklisted (domain or IP), the specific blacklist it was found on (e.g., Spamhaus), and the time of detection.\n5.  **Status Logging**: The status of each asset (clean or listed) is logged in a central dashboard. This allows us to track the history of an IP or domain, see when a listing occurred, and when it was resolved.\n\n---\n\n### Setup Steps\n\nFollow these steps to set up the automated blacklist monitor.\n\n1.  **Select a Service**: Choose a reliable blacklist monitoring service. Services like **MXToolBox**, **HetrixTools**, or **Uptime Robot** (with custom checks) are popular options.\n2.  **Create an Account**: Sign up and create an account for your organization on the chosen platform.\n3.  **Add Monitored Assets**: Navigate to the \"Monitors\" or \"Assets\" section within the service's dashboard. Add all of the following:\n    * Your primary domain names (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).\n    * All outbound mail server IP addresses.\n    * Any other publicly facing IP addresses associated with your business.\n4.  **Configure Notification Channels**: Set up how and where you want to receive alerts. The best practice is to configure multiple channels for redundancy:\n    * **Email**: Send alerts to a group alias like `security@yourcompany.com` or `it-alerts@yourcompany.com`.\n    * **Chat/IM**: Integrate with a communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams and create a dedicated channel (e.g., `#blacklist-alerts`).\n    * **Ticketing System**: Configure the service to automatically open a ticket in your help desk software (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow) when a new listing is found.\n5.  **Set Up Check Frequency**: Configure how often you want the system to perform checks. A frequency of every **15 to 30 minutes** is a good starting point for a high-priority service like email.\n6.  **Create a Runbook**: A runbook is a document that outlines the steps to take when an alert is received. Create and share a runbook with your team that includes:\n    * **Confirmation**: How to verify the listing.\n    * **Investigation**: Initial steps to find the root cause (e.g., checking mail logs for spam).\n    * **Delisting**: How to submit a delisting request to the specific blacklist provider.\n7.  **Initial Testing**: Once everything is configured, perform a manual check to ensure the system is working and that all notification channels are active. You can often do this with a \"test check\" button within the monitoring service's dashboard.",

            "content": "# Automated Domain/IP Blacklist Monitor\n\n## 📝 Problem\n\n*The core problem we're solving:** Our email deliverability and sender reputation are at risk if our domain or IP addresses are listed on spam blacklists. Manual, ad-hoc checks are inefficient and often reactive, meaning we only discover a problem after emails are already bouncing or being marked as spam. This can lead to a loss of customer trust and business.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Solution\n\n*How this workflow addresses the problem:** This automated workflow proactively monitors our key domains and IP addresses against major blacklists. It will automatically check for new listings on a set schedule and send immediate alerts to the appropriate team members if a blacklisting is detected. This allows us to react quickly, identify the root cause, and initiate the delisting process before our reputation is severely impacted.\n\n---\n\n## 👥 For Whom\n\n**Who will use this system:**\n* *System Administrators:** To monitor the health of our email servers and network infrastructure.\n* *Marketing Team:** To ensure email campaigns reach their audience and maintain a high sender reputation.\n* *Security Team:** To quickly identify potential compromised systems or malicious activity on our network that could be causing the blacklisting.\n* *IT Support:** To respond to support tickets from customers about email delivery issues.\n\n---\n\n## 🌐 Scope\n\n**What is included:**\n* Automatic, scheduled checks of all specified domains and IP addresses against a list of major blacklists (e.g., Spamhaus, Barracuda, SpamCop).\n* Real-time notifications (e.g., via email, Slack, or a ticket system) upon detection of a blacklisting event.\n* A centralized dashboard or log for viewing the status of all monitored assets.\n\n**What is out of scope:**\n* *Automatic delisting:** This workflow does not automatically request delisting. Delisting requires a manual investigation to address the underlying problem and a formal request to the blacklist provider.\n* *Root cause analysis:** The system will not automatically determine why an IP or domain was blacklisted. This requires human investigation.\n* *Internal mail server log analysis:** While the monitor can point to a problem, it does not analyze internal email logs to find the source of the spam.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to Set Up\n\nFollow these steps to set up the automated blacklist monitor:\n\n1.  **Choose a Monitoring Service:** Select a reliable blacklist monitoring service (e.g., HetrixTools, MXToolBox, or a similar platform).\n2.  **Create an Account:** Sign up for the service and set up your organization's account.\n3.  **Add Monitored Assets:**\n    * Navigate to the \"Monitors\" or \"Assets\" section.\n    * Add each of our core domains (e.g., `ourcompany.com`) and all relevant outbound mail server IP addresses.\n4.  **Configure Notifications:**\n    * Set up notification channels for alerts. This could be an email to `security@ourcompany.com` or a dedicated Slack channel (`#blacklist-alerts`).\n    * Customize the notification frequency and details to ensure the alerts are actionable.\n5.  **Review the Dashboard:** Familiarize yourself with the system's dashboard. This will be your central point for reviewing the status of all monitored assets and viewing historical data.\n6.  **Set an Action Plan:** Document the steps to take when an alert is received, including:\n    * Immediately notifying the security and IT teams.\n    * Opening an incident ticket.\n    * Beginning the root cause analysis.\n    * Documenting the delisting process."
