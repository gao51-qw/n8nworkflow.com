  "description": "## Overview: Recrutei ATS - Ultimate Internal AI Agent\n\nThis workflow transforms Slack into a powerful command center for recruitment. Using an AI Agent (LangChain) integrated with the Recrutei ATS API and MCP, your team can manage candidates, vacancies, tags and a lot more directly through Slack messages.\n\n## Key Features\n* **Natural Language Processing:** Use GPT-4 to interpret complex requests like \"Find candidates for the Python role and tag them as 'Senior'\".\n* **Candidate Management:** Create prospects, disqualify candidates, or move them between pipeline stages.\n* **Vacancy Insights:** Add and read comments on vacancies directly from the chat.\n* **Tagging System:** Create, list, and delete tags dynamically.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n1.  **Slack Trigger:** Connect your Slack account and invite the bot to your desired channel.\n2.  **OpenAI:** Configure your API Key. This agent uses GPT-4o-mini (or GPT-4) for high-reasoning capabilities.\n3.  **HTTP Request Tools:** Every \"Tool\" node (Pink nodes) needs your Recrutei API Token.\n    * Replace the `Authorization` header with your `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`.\n    * Update the Base URL if necessary.\n4.  **Slack Post:** Ensure the bot has permissions to write in the channel.",
