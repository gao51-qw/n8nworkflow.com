*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically monitors local event platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup, Facebook Events) and aggregates upcoming events that match your criteria. Never miss a networking or sponsorship opportunity again.

## Overview

A scheduled trigger scrapes multiple event sites via Bright Data, filtering by location, date range, and keywords. OpenAI classifies each event (conference, meetup, workshop) and extracts key details such as venue, organizers, and ticket price. Updates are posted to Slack and archived in Airtable for quick lookup.
