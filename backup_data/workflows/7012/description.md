# Generate Images from Text with IBM Granite Vision 3.3 2B AI Model

### 🌍 **Overview**

This workflow uses the **ibm-granite/granite-vision-3.3-2b** model (hosted on Replicate) to generate AI images. It starts manually, sends a request to the Replicate API, waits for the result, and finally outputs the generated image link.

Think of it as your **AI art assistant** — you click once, and it handles the full request/response cycle for image generation.

## 🟢 Section 1: Trigger & API Setup

🔗 **Nodes:**

* **Manual Trigger** → Starts when you click *Execute*.
* **Set API Key** → Stores your Replicate API Key safely in the workflow.

💡 **Beginner takeaway:**
This section is like turning the key in the ignition. You start the workflow, and it loads your credentials so you can talk to Replicate’s API.

📈 **Advantage:**
Keeps your API key stored inside the workflow instead of hard-coding it everywhere.

## 🟦 Section 2: Create Prediction

🔗 **Nodes:**

* **HTTP Request (Create Prediction)** → Sends a request to Replicate with the chosen model (`granite-vision-3.3-2b`) and input parameters (seed, temperature, max\_tokens, etc.).

💡 **Beginner takeaway:**
This is where the workflow actually **asks the AI model to generate an image**.

📈 **Advantage:**
You can tweak parameters like **creativity (temperature)** or **randomness (seed)** to control results.

## 🟣 Section 3: Polling & Status Check

🔗 **Nodes:**

* **Extract Prediction ID (Code)** → Saves the unique job ID.
* **Wait (2s)** → Pauses before checking status.
* **Check Prediction Status (HTTP Request)** → Calls Replicate to see if the image is ready.
* **If Condition (Check If Complete)** →

  * ✅ If `status = succeeded` → move to result
  * 🔄 Else → go back to Wait and check again

💡 **Beginner takeaway:**
Since image generation takes a few seconds, this section keeps **asking the AI “are you done yet?”** until the image is ready.

📈 **Advantage:**
No need to guess — the workflow waits automatically and retries until success.

---

## 🔵 Section 4: Process Result

🔗 **Nodes:**

* **Process Result (Code)** → Extracts the final data:

  * ✅ Status
  * ✅ Output image URL
  * ✅ Metrics (time taken, etc.)
  * ✅ Model info

💡 **Beginner takeaway:**
This section **collects the finished image link** and prepares it neatly for you.

📈 **Advantage:**
You get structured output that you can **save, display, or use in another workflow** (like auto-sending images to Slack or saving to Google Drive).
