  "description": "## Overview\nSend an AI a few details about your \"Dream Customer\" in normal english, then have it search the web and give you a \"Dream 100\" - 100 ideal prospects to connect with in your industry.  \n\nGreat for stress-testing a product idea or giving you a start for networking in an industry.\n\n## How it works\n\n- Send the AI agent information about your business + ideal customer.  It will ask you to clarify any additional info.\n- The agent will use an LLM to turn your criteria into specific prompts for an internet search\n- Perplexity will use those prompts to identify ideal customers\n- An LLM will format those Perplexity results, then they'll be added to a Google sheet.\n\n\n## Set up steps\n\n1. Copy the provided google sheets template into your Google Drive\n2. Connect your Google Drive/Sheets to the workflow\n3. Connect OpenRouter and Perplexity to the workflow (Just paste in your API key!)\n4. If desired, connect the Slack trigger/response nodes to control the agent from Slack.\n",
