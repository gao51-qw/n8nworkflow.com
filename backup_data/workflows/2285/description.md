## Purpose
This workflow enables you to listen to your recent favorites in very hight quality offline without sacrificing all of your storage.

## How it works
This workflow automatically creates a playlist in Spotify named "Downloads" which periodically gets updated so it always contains only a defined amount of the latest liked songs.

This enables only the Downloads playlist to set for automatic downloading and thus free up space on the device.

## Setup
- The workflow is ready to go. Just select your Spotify credentials and activate the workflow.
- In Spotify just enable automatic downloads on the automatically created Downloads folder after the first workflow run.

## Current limitations
This setup currently supports a maximum of 50 songs in the Downloads Playlist. This is due to the paylod limits defined by Spotify encountered in the *Get liked songs* node. Implementing batching would solve the issue.
