This workflow automatically creates in-depth, SEO-friendly Arabic articles based on any keyword you provide. It researches the topic, generates a full article outline, writes every section in Arabic, and saves the final article directly to your Notion workspace—all in a few clicks.

- **Step 2:** The workflow researches the topic using advanced AI, gathers trending questions from Google, and creates a detailed, structured outline.
- **Step 3:** Each section of the article is written in Arabic by AI, following best SEO practices and including real FAQs.
- **Step 4:** The completed article is automatically formatted and saved to your Notion database, ready for review or publishing.
