  "description": "### Good to know:\n\nThis workflow creates a WhatsApp chatbot that answers questions using your own PDFs through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Every time you upload a document to Google Drive, it is processed into embeddings and stored in Pinecone—allowing the bot to respond with accurate, context-aware answers directly on WhatsApp.\n\n### Who is this for?\n\n- Anyone building a custom WhatsApp chatbot.\n \n- Businesses wanting a private knowledge based assistant\n\n- Teams that want their documents to be searchable via chat\n\n- Creators/coaches who want automated Q&A from their PDFs\n\n- Developers who want a no-code RAG pipeline using n8n\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\n```This workflow eliminates the need to manually search through documents or upload data every time someone asks a question. It turns your PDFs into a smart, searchable knowledge base and delivers instant, accurate answers to WhatsApp users—without hallucinations or manual work.```\n\n### What this workflow does:\n\n✅ Monitors a Google Drive folder for new PDFs\n✅ Extracts and splits text into chunks\n✅ Generates embeddings using OpenAI/Gemini\n✅ Stores embeddings in a Pinecone vector index\n✅ Receives user questions via WhatsApp\n✅ Retrieves the most relevant info using vector search\n✅ Generates a natural response using an AI Agent\n✅ Sends the answer back to the user on WhatsApp\n\n### How it works:\n\n1️⃣ Google Drive Trigger detects a new or updated PDF\n2️⃣ File is downloaded and its text is split into chunks\n3️⃣ Embeddings are generated and stored in Pinecone\n4️⃣ WhatsApp Trigger receives a user’s question\n5️⃣ The question is embedded and matched with Pinecone\n6️⃣ AI Agent uses retrieved context to generate a response\n7️⃣ The message is delivered back to the user on WhatsApp\n\n### How to use:\n\n- Connect your Google Drive account\n\n- Add your Pinecone API key and index name\n\n- Add your OpenAI/Gemini API key\n\n- Connect your WhatsApp trigger + sender nodes\n\n- Upload a sample PDF to your Drive folder\n\n- Send a test WhatsApp message to see the bot reply\n\n### Requirements:\n\n✅ n8n cloud or self-hosted\n✅ Google Drive account\n✅ Pinecone vector database\n✅ OpenAI or Gemini API key\n✅ WhatsApp integration (Cloud API or provider)\n\n### Customizing this workflow:\n\n🟢 Change the Drive folder or add file-type filters\n🟢 Adjust chunk size or embedding model\n🟢 Modify the AI prompt for tone, style, or restrictions\n🟢 Add memory, logging, or analytics\n🟢 Add multiple documents or delete old vector entries\n🟢 Swap the AI model (OpenAI ↔ Gemini ↔ Groq, etc.)",
