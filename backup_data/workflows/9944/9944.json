    "description": "# Ebook to Audiobook Converter\n\n[![Watch Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xKqkjXIPZoM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xKqkjXIPZoM)\n\n**[▶️ Watch Full Demo Video](https://youtu.be/xKqkjXIPZoM)**\n\n---\n\n## What It Does\n\nTurn any PDF ebook into a professional audiobook automatically. Upload a PDF, get an MP3 audiobook in your Google Drive. Perfect for listening to books, research papers, or documents on the go.\n\n**Example**: [Input PDF](https://www.laburnumps.vic.edu.au/uploaded_files/media/little_red_riding_hood.pdf) → [Output Audiobook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12aVR2p-ZQ2DyqXCUgJPouzy-acoAB7WO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Upload PDF via web form → Get MP3 audiobook in Google Drive\n- Natural-sounding AI voices (MiniMax Speech-02-HD)\n- Automatic text extraction, chunking, and audio merging\n- Customizable voice, speed, and emotion settings\n- Processes long books in batches with smart rate limiting\n\n## Perfect For\n\n- **Students**: Turn textbooks into study audiobooks\n- **Professionals**: Listen to reports and documents while commuting\n- **Content Creators**: Repurpose written content as audio\n- **Accessibility**: Make content accessible to visually impaired users\n\n## Requirements\n\n| Component | Details |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **n8n** | Self-hosted ONLY (cannot run on n8n Cloud) |\n| **FFmpeg** | Must be installed in your n8n environment |\n| **Replicate API** | For MiniMax TTS ([Sign up here](https://replicate.com)) |\n| **Google Drive** | OAuth2 credentials + \"Audiobook\" folder |\n\n⚠️ **Important**: This workflow **does NOT work on n8n Cloud** because FFmpeg installation is required.\n\n## Quick Setup\n\n### 1. Install FFmpeg\n\n**Docker users:**\n```bash\ndocker exec -it &lt;n8n-container-name&gt; /bin/bash\napt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg\n```\n\n**Native installation:**\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg  # Linux\nbrew install ffmpeg          # macOS\n```\n\n### 2. Get API Keys\n- **Replicate**: Sign up at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com) and copy your API token\n- **Google Drive**: Set up OAuth2 in n8n and create an \"Audiobook\" folder in Drive\n\n### 3. Import & Configure\n1. Import `n8n.json` into your n8n instance\n2. Replace the Replicate API token in the \"MINIMAX TTS\" node\n3. Configure Google Drive credentials and select your \"Audiobook\" folder\n4. Activate the workflow\n\n## Cost Estimate\n\n| Component | Cost |\n|-----------|------|\n| **MiniMax TTS API** | ~$0.15 per 1000 characters (~$3-5 for average book) |\n| **Google Drive Storage** | Free (up to 15GB) |\n| **Processing Time** | ~1-2 minutes per 10 pages |\n\n## How It Works\n\n![Workflow Diagram](https://articles.emp0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-from-2025-10-20-19-23-45.png)\n\n```\nPDF Upload → Extract Text → Split into Chunks → Convert to Speech (batches of 5)\n→ Merge Audio Files (FFmpeg) → Upload to Google Drive\n```\n\nThe workflow uses four main modules:\n1. **Extraction**: PDF text extraction and intelligent chunking\n2. **Conversion**: MiniMax TTS processes text in batches\n3. **Merging**: FFmpeg combines all audio files seamlessly\n4. **Upload**: Final audiobook saved to Google Drive\n\n## Voice Settings (Customizable)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"voice_id\": \"Friendly_Person\",\n  \"emotion\": \"happy\",\n  \"speed\": 1,\n  \"pitch\": 0\n}\n```\n\nAvailable emotions: `happy`, `neutral`, `sad`, `angry`, `excited`\n\n## Limitations\n\n- ⚠️ **Self-hosted n8n ONLY** (not compatible with n8n Cloud)\n- PDF files only (not EPUB, MOBI, or scanned images)\n- Large books (500+ pages) take longer to process\n- Requires FFmpeg installation (see setup above)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**FFmpeg not found?**\n- Docker: Run `docker exec -it &lt;container&gt; /bin/bash` then `apt-get install ffmpeg`\n- Native: Run `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg` (Linux) or `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)\n\n**Rate limit errors?**\n- Increase wait time in the \"WAITS FOR 5 SECONDS\" node to 10-15 seconds\n\n**Google Drive upload fails?**\n- Make sure you created the \"Audiobook\" folder in your Google Drive\n- Reconfigure OAuth2 credentials in n8n\n\n---\n\nCreated by [emp0](https://emp0.com) | More workflows: [n8n Gallery](https://n8n.io/creators/jay-emp0/)\n",
