**Workflow Description: Product Data Extractor**

This workflow automates the extraction of product data from Product Hunt by combining webhook interactions, HTML processing, AI-based data analysis, and structured output formatting. It is designed to handle incoming requests dynamically and return detailed JSON responses for further usage.

### **Overview**

The workflow processes a product name submitted through a webhook. It fetches the corresponding Product Hunt page, extracts and analyzes inline scripts, and structures the data into a well-defined JSON format using AI tools. The final JSON response is returned to the client through the webhook.

### **Workflow Steps**

#### 1. **Webhook Listener**

- **Node:** Receive Product Request
- **Function:** Captures incoming requests containing the product name to process.
- **Details:** Accepts HTTP requests and extracts the `product` parameter from the query string, such as `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;/?product=epigram`.

#### 2. **Fetch Product HTML**

- **Node:** Fetch Product HTML
- **Function:** Sends an HTTP request to retrieve the HTML content of the specified Product Hunt page.
- **Details:** Constructs a dynamic URL using the product name and fetches the page data.

#### 3. **Extract Inline Scripts**

- **Node:** Extract Inline Scripts
- **Function:** Parses the HTML content to extract inline scripts located within the `&lt;head&gt;` section.
- **Details:** Excludes scripts containing `src` attributes and validates the presence of inline scripts.

#### 4. **Process Data with LLM**

- **Node:** Process Script with LLM
- **Function:** Analyzes the extracted scripts using a language model to identify key product data.
- **Details:** Processes the script to derive structured and meaningful insights.

#### 5. **Refine Data with Google Gemini**

- **Node:** Analyze Script with Google Gemini
- **Function:** Leverages Google Gemini AI for enhanced analysis of script data.
- **Details:** Ensures the extracted data is precise and enriched.

#### 6. **Format Product Data to JSON**

- **Node:** Format Product Data to JSON
- **Function:** Structures the processed data into a clean JSON format.
- **Details:** Defines a schema to ensure all relevant fields are included in the output.

#### 7. **Send JSON Response to Client**

- **Node:** Send JSON Response to Client
- **Function:** Returns the final structured JSON response to the client.
- **Details:** Sends the response back via the same webhook that initiated the request. For example, `&lt;custom_webhook_url&gt;`.

### **Key Features**

- **Versatile Use Cases:** This workflow can be used to gather Product Hunt data for creating blog posts or as a tool for AI agents to research products efficiently.
- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes the Gemini 1.5 8B AI model, offering reduced latency and minimal or no cost depending on the use case.
- **Selector Independence:** Functions even if Product Hunt's DOM structure changes, as it does not rely on direct DOM selectors.
- **Reliable Data Output:** A low temperature setting (0) and a precisely defined JSON schema ensure accurate and real data extraction.
- **Dynamic Processing:** Adapts to various product names through dynamic URL construction.
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes advanced language models for data extraction and refinement.
- **Structured Output:** Ensures the output JSON adheres to a predefined schema for consistency.
- **Error Handling:** Includes validations to handle missing or malformed data gracefully.

### **Customization Options**

### **Limitations**
- **Dependency on Product Hunt:** Significant changes to the way Product Hunt loads data on its pages might require modifications to the workflow.
- **Adaptability:** Even if changes occur, the workflow can be updated to maintain functionality due to its reliance on AI and not direct DOM selectors.


- Modify the webhook path to suit your application.
- Adjust the prompt for the language model to include additional fields.
- Extend the JSON schema to capture more data fields as needed.

### **Expected Output**

**Performance Metrics**
- **Response Time:** Typically ~6 seconds per product.
- **Accuracy:** Data extracted with &gt;95% precision due to the pre-defined JSON schema.
