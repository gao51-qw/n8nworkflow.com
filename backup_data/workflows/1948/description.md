This is an example workflow that imports an XML file into an SQL database.
- The ReadBinaryFiles node loads the XML file from the server.
- Then the Code node extracts the file content from the binary buffer.
- Afterwards, an XML node converts the XML string into a JSON structure.
- Finally, in the MySQL node inserts the data records into the SQL table.

In the upper part of the workflow there is another MySQL node that is disabled. This node creates a new table with all the required variables based on the sample SQL database: https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx
