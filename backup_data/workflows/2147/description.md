## Use case
This workflow snoozes any Todoist tasks, by moving them into a Snoozed todoist list and unsnoozes them 3 days before due date. Helps keep inbox clear only of tasks you need to worry about soon.

## How to setup
1. Add your Todoist creds
2. Create a Todoist project called `snoozed`
3. Set the project ids in the relevant nodes
4. Add due dates to your tasks in Inbox. Watch them disappear to `snoozed`. Set their date to tomorrow, watch it return to inbox.

## How to adjust this template
Adjust the timeline.. Maybe 3 days is too close for you. Works mostly for me :)
