You’ve onboarded your client with elegance. Now, keep the relationship warm — and get glowing testimonials — without manual follow-up.

- 💬 Notifies you on Telegram when feedback arrives
- 📊 Logs everything in Notion for tracking

Perfect for:
- Coaches who want consistent client care
- Designers building social proof
- Service providers scaling with grace

No spreadsheets. No forgotten follow-ups. Just **gentle, timely nurturing** — on autopilot.

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Import the Workflow
1. In n8n, go to **Workflows &gt; Create from JSON**
2. Paste the provided JSON
3. Click **Import**

### 2. Set Up Credentials
- **Notion**: Connect to your `Clients` database
- **Email**: Set up SMTP (e.g., Gmail app password)
- **Telegram** (optional): Add bot token and chat ID

🔐 Never hardcode keys.

### 3. Configure Nurture Emails
In the **Email: Send Nurture** nodes:
- Customize tone for your industry (coaching, design, e-commerce)
- Add your logo and branding
- Include a personal note

### 4. Build Your Testimonial Form
Use **Tally** or **Fillout** to create a simple form:
- “How has this program helped you?”
- “What would you tell someone considering it?”
- Webhook sends response to n8n

### 5. Automate the Flow
The workflow uses **Schedule Triggers** and **Delays** to send emails at:
- Day 7: “Getting Started” tips
- Day 30: “Midpoint Check-In” + resource
- Day 60: “How’s it going?” + testimonial ask

🔁 Runs automatically for every new client.

## Customization Guidance

- 🎨 **Change email tone**: Friendly, professional, or bold
- 🎁 **Add a bonus**: Send a gift card for testimonials
- 📲 **Swap Telegram for WhatsApp**: Use WhatsAble
- 📊 **Sync to Airtable**: Mirror feedback for reporting
