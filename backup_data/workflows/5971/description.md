*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically scrapes local business directories (Yelp, Yellow Pages, Google Maps, etc.) to build a structured database of prospects. Stop copying listings by hand—get fresh leads delivered straight to Google Sheets.

## Overview

Using Bright Data, the automation fetches business names, contact details, ratings, and categories for a given city or ZIP code. OpenAI cleans and normalizes the data, while duplicate detection ensures each business appears only once. The result is emailed as a CSV and stored in Sheets for easy filtering.

- **Bright Data** – Handles large-scale directory scraping
