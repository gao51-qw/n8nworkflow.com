## Who is this for?

This template is ideal for **HR teams, startup founders, operations leads, remote-first companies, and freelancers** managing onboarding manually or across multiple tools.

Whether you’re hiring your first intern or streamlining onboarding for dozens of new team members, this workflow automates the entire **trigger → task creation → onboarding delivery** process using no-code tools connected via n8n.

---

## What problem does this solve?

Employee onboarding is often fragmented and error-prone — involving Jira tasks, Slack DMs, file sharing, and email templates spread across different apps.

This workflow connects it all, letting you **create tasks, notify people, share folders, and message hires instantly** — right when they’re marked as “Hired” in a Google Sheet or added to Slack.

No more bouncing between 5 tabs. This is onboarding as a system.
