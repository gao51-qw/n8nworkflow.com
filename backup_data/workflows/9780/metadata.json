  "description": "## Description\nThis automation detects when you post a Tiktok video, automatically downloads the video without watermark, stores it in Google Drive, and reposts your Tiktok video to other social media platforms. All on autopilot. So you can grow your presence on multiple platforms, without more work. You can also easily add steps to customize captions per platform.\n\n## Youtube Tutorial\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHbyEb-fBGY\n\n## 📄 Documentation\n[Full Step-by-Step Documentation](https://help.blotato.com/api/templates/8-repurpose-tiktoks-on-autopilot)\n\n## How It Works\n\n**1. Trigger**\n- RSS feed triggers when you post a new Tiktok video\n\n**2. Fetch Video**\n- Download the newly posted Tiktok video (without watermark)  \n- Store video in Google Drive\n\n**3.
