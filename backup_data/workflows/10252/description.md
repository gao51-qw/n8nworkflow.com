### Who this is for?

This workflow is designed for:

* **Marketing analysts**, **SEO specialists**, and **content strategists** who want automated intelligence on their online competitors.
* **Growth teams** that need quick insights from SERP (Search Engine Results Pages) without manual data scraping.
* **Agencies** managing multiple clients’ SEO presence and tracking competitive positioning in real-time.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manual competitor research is time-consuming, fragmented, and often lacks actionable insights.
This workflow automates the entire process by:

* Fetching SERP results from multiple search engines (Google, Bing, Yandex, DuckDuckGo) using Thordata’s Scraper API.
* Using **OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini** to analyze, summarize, and extract keyword opportunities, topic clusters, and competitor weaknesses.
* Producing structured, JSON-based insights ready for dashboards or reports.

Essentially, it transforms raw SERP data into strategic marketing intelligence — saving hours of research time.

### What this workflow does

Here’s a step-by-step overview of how the workflow operates:

#### Step 1: Manual Trigger

Initiates the process on demand when you click “Execute Workflow.”

#### Step 2: Set the Input Query

The “Set Input Fields” node defines your **search query**, such as:

&gt; “Top SEO strategies for e-commerce in 2025”

#### Step 3: Multi-Engine SERP Fetching

Four HTTP request tools send the query to **Thordata Scraper API** to retrieve results from:

* Google
* Bing
* Yandex
* DuckDuckGo

Each uses **Bearer Authentication** configured via “Thordata SERP Bearer Auth Account.”

#### Step 4: AI Agent Processing

The **LangChain AI Agent** orchestrates the data flow, combining inputs and preparing them for structured analysis.

#### Step 5: SEO Analysis

* The **SEO Analyst** node (powered by GPT-4.1-mini) parses SERP results into a structured schema, extracting:

  * Competitor domains
  * Page titles & content types
  * Ranking positions
  * Keyword overlaps
  * Traffic share estimations
  * Strengths and weaknesses

#### Step 6: Summarization

The **Summarize the content** node distills complex data into a concise executive summary using GPT-4.1-mini.

#### Step 7: Keyword & Topic Extraction

The **Keyword and Topic Analysis** node extracts:

* Primary and secondary keywords
* Topic clusters and content gaps
* SEO strength scores
* Competitor insights

#### Step 8: Output Formatting

The **Structured Output Parser** ensures results are clean, validated JSON objects for further integration (e.g., Google Sheets, Notion, or dashboards).
