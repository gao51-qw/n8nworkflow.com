## 📄✨ Easy WordPress Content Creation from PDF Docs + Human in the Loop Gmail

This n8n workflow automates the process of transforming PDF documents into engaging, SEO-friendly WordPress blog posts. It incorporates AI-powered text analysis, automatic image generation, and a human review step to ensure quality before publishing.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🗂️ PDF Upload & Text Extraction  
- Users upload a PDF document through a form trigger.  
- The workflow extracts text from the uploaded file, ensuring compatibility with supported formats.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Blog Post Generation  
- The extracted text is analyzed by an AI model (GPT-based) to create a structured blog post.  
- The AI generates:  
  - A captivating SEO-friendly title.  
  - Well-formatted HTML content, including an introduction, chapters with subheadings, and a conclusion.

### 🎨 Image Creation & Integration  
- An image is generated using **Pollinations.ai** based on the blog post title.  
- The vibrant image is uploaded to WordPress and set as the featured image for the post.

### 📝 WordPress Draft Creation  
- A draft blog post is created on WordPress with the AI-generated title, content, and featured image.  

### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop Approval  
- The draft content is sent via Gmail to a reviewer for manual approval.  
- If approved, the post is published on WordPress. If not, an error message is sent for troubleshooting.

### 📢 Multi-Channel Notifications  
- Once published, notifications are sent via Gmail and Telegram to relevant stakeholders.
