The XXXXXXXXXXXXXX should be replaced by the Web Unlocker Token.\n- In n8n, configure the Google Gemini(PaLM) Api account with the Google Gemini API key (or access through Vertex AI or proxy).\n- In n8n, configure the Airtable Personal Access Token account under Credentials.\n- Update the Webhook Notifier with the Webhook endpoint of your choice.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\nThis workflow is built to be flexible - whether you're a company or a market researcher, entrepreneur, or data analyst. Here's how you can adapt it to fit your specific use case:\n\n- **Extend the scraper**: Modify Bright Data targets to pull job listings, salaries, or employee reviews via the Airtable data source.\n\n- **Customize the summary prompt**: Ask Gemini to extract different attributes hiring trends, practices etc.\n\n- **Routing the output to different destinations**:\nSend summaries or transformed response to Google Sheets, Airtable, or CRMs like HubSpot or Salesforce etc.\n\n",
