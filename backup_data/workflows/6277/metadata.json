  "description": "📩🤖 This workflow automatically processes emails received in Gmail, **extracts their attachments**, and **organizes them into specific folders in Google Drive based on the sender's email address**.\n\n**Note**: The workflow avoids duplicates by checking folder existence before creation.\n\n\n---\n\n### **Benefits:**\n\n* ✅ **Automated Organization:** No need to manually sort or download email attachments.\n* 📁 **Sender-based Categorization:** Files are stored in clearly labeled folders per sender, improving traceability and reducing clutter.\n* ⏱ **Time-saving:** Reduces repetitive administrative tasks by automating the workflow end-to-end.\n* 🔁 **Modular and Scalable:** Can be easily extended or reused with other services (e.g., Dropbox, S3) or integrated into larger document workflows.\n* 🔐 **Secure Cloud Storage:** Attachments are safely backed up in Google Drive, minimizing the risk of data loss from email.\n\n---  \n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Trigger**:  \n   - The workflow can be triggered **manually** (*\"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’*) or **automatically** (via *Gmail Trigger* polling emails every minute).  \n2. **Email Processing**:  \n   - Fetches emails (with attachments) from Gmail within a date range (default: July 6–9, 2025).  \n   - For each email, checks if it **contains attachments** (via *IF* node).  \n3. **Folder Management**:  \n   - Searches Google Drive for a folder named after the **sender’s email address** (under parent folder *\"Email Attachments\"*).  \n   - Creates the folder if it doesn’t exist.  \n4. **Attachment Handling**:  \n   - Splits out binary attachments, extracts filenames, and uploads each file to the sender’s dedicated folder in Google Drive.  \n5. **Sub-Workflow Execution**:  \n   - Uses *Execute Workflow* to modularize the upload process (reusable for other workflows).  \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Google Services**:  \n   - Connect **Gmail** and **Google Drive** nodes to your accounts via OAuth2.  \n   - Ensure the parent folder *\"Email Attachments\"* (ID: `1EitwWVd5rKZTlvOreB4R-6xxxxxx`) exists in Google Drive.  \n2. **Adjust Date Range**:  \n   - Modify `receivedAfter`/`receivedBefore` in the *Get emails* node to target specific emails.  \n3. **Test**:  \n   - Run manually to verify folder creation and attachment uploads.  \n4. **Activate Automation**:  \n   - Enable the *Gmail Trigger* for real-time processing (currently `active: false`).  \n\n\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/). \n",
