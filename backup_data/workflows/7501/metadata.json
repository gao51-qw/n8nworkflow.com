  "description": "# AWS IAM Access Key Rotation Reminder Automation Workflow\n### Watch the demo video below:\n[![Watch the video](https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/automatewith.me/aws-iam-access-key-rotation-alert-with-n8n.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tW2y_dRvcs0)\n## **Who’s it for**\n- DevOps/SRE teams responsible for AWS account security.  \n- Security/compliance officers ensuring key rotation policies are followed.  \n- Any AWS account owner who wants automatic detection of stale access keys. \n\n## **How it works / What it does**\n1. **Weekly Scheduler** — triggers the workflow on a recurring basis.  \n2. **Get Many Users** — fetches all IAM users in the AWS account.  \n3. **Get User Access Key(s)** — retrieves the access keys associated with each user.  \n4. **Filter Out Inactive Keys** — removes keys that are not active (e.g., status `Inactive`).  \n5. **Access Key Older Than 365 Days** — checks the key creation date and flags keys older than one year.  \n6. **Send Slack Message** — notifies a Slack channel with details of the outdated key(s) for review and action.  \n7. **No Operation** — safely ends the workflow if no keys match the condition.  \n\n## **How to set up**\n- Configure the **Weekly Scheduler** to run at your desired cadence (e.g., every Monday).  \n- Use **Get Many Users** to list all IAM users.  \n- For each user, call **ListAccessKeys** (`Get User Access Key(s)`) to fetch their key metadata.  \n- Apply a filter to keep only keys with status `Active`.  \n- Add a condition to compare `CreateDate` against `today - 365 days`.  \n- Send results to Slack using the **Slack Post Message** node.  \n\n## **Requirements**\n- n8n (latest version).  \n- AWS credential in n8n configured for **us-east-1** (IAM requires signing with this region).  \n- IAM permissions:  \n  - `iam:ListUsers`  \n  - `iam:ListAccessKeys`  \n- Slack bot credentials with permission to post messages in the desired channel.  \n\n## **How to customize the workflow**\n- **Change threshold** — adjust the `365 days` condition to 90, 180, or any other rotation policy.  \n- **Escalation** — mention `@security` or create a Jira/Ticket when old keys are found.  \n- **Logging** — push flagged results into a Google Sheet, database, or log management system for audit.  \n- **Automation** — instead of only notifying, add a step to automatically deactivate keys older than the threshold (after approval).  \n- **Multi-account support** — duplicate or loop across multiple AWS credentials if you manage several AWS accounts.
