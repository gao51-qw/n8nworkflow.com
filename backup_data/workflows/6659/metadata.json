You'll primarily need to:\n\n- Authenticate your preferred calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar).\n\n- Connect your email sending service (e.g., Gmail).\n\n- Specify the email address where you want to receive the summary.\n\nAll detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.",
