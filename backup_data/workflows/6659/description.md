**How it works**

This workflow keeps you perfectly informed about your upcoming week's schedule. Every Sunday evening, it automatically:

- Fetches all your scheduled meetings for the upcoming week (Monday to Sunday) from your connected calendar.

- Compiles a concise summary of these meetings, including dates, times, and event titles.

- Sends you a single, organized email so you can quickly review your agenda and prepare for the week ahead.

Stay ahead of your schedule with this proactive meeting notification system.

**Set up steps**

Setting up this workflow is quick and easy, typically taking less than 10 minutes. You'll primarily need to:

- Authenticate your preferred calendar service (e.g., Google Calendar).

- Connect your email sending service (e.g., Gmail).

- Specify the email address where you want to receive the summary.

All detailed setup instructions and specific configuration guidance are provided within the workflow itself using sticky notes.
