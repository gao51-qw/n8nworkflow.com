  "description": "## What's the problem?\n\nImagine you want to **automate a task** where, based on a TikTok video link, **you must retrieve the username of the creator of that video**.\n\nMany people may think that it's enough to get the \"@\" part of the link but that's not the case always. TikTok's iOS and Android app have **specific link formats** that are easier to share with others but, at the same time, it makes our task of retrieving creators way harder.\n\n## Our solution:\n\n**In solution to this problem, this simple workflow** makes a HTTP protocol request to retrieve the original link of the video hosted on _www.tiktok.com_ instead of the default mobile app's subdomain _vm.tiktok.com_. Then, we can in fact remove the attributes of the link and extract the handle correctly.\n\n## Good things to know:\n\n**Note that we extract the username** (and not the profile's nickname) **without the \"@\"**.\n\nOnce we have our username, we can simply access to their profile from then on using _\"https://www.tiktok.com/@{{ $json.username }}\"_.",
