# AI recruiting pipeline: Job to candidate shortlist with Apollo & Airtable

> ## Who’s it for
Recruiting agencies, executive search firms, and in-house talent teams that want to automate candidate sourcing and prequalification. Instead of spending hours searching, scoring, and writing outreach, this workflow turns any job description into a ready-to-use shortlist with personalized messages.

## What it does (How it works)
This workflow takes a job description (title, description, and location) and runs a complete recruiting automation pipeline:

- **Normalize job titles** and generate variations to widen search coverage.
- **Search candidates** in Apollo (or your CRM / database of choice).
- **Remove duplicates** to keep clean lists.
- **Score candidates** with AI (0–5) and provide concise reasoning across experience, industry, and seniority.
- **Enrich LinkedIn profiles** (name, title, image, location, experience).
- **Create structured candidate assessments** (summary, alignment, red flags, positives).
- **Generate outreach messages** (email + LinkedIn DM) tailored to the candidate.
- **Write to Airtable** for job/candidate tracking and downstream automation.

Everything is plug-and-play, with no manual searching or copy-pasting required.

## Requirements
- n8n (Cloud or self-hosted)  
- Airtable account + API access  
- Apollo API or your preferred candidate source  
- LLM provider: OpenAI or Anthropic  
- LinkedIn enrichment API (RapidAPI, Apify, etc.)  

&gt; ⚠️ Do not hardcode API keys in HTTP nodes. Always use **Credentials** in n8n.

## Airtable table specifications
Create one base (e.g., *Candidate Search – From Job Description*) with two tables:

**Jobs Table**  
- `Job Title` (text)  
- `Job Description` (long text)  
- `Job Location` (text)  
- `Candidates` (linked to Candidates table)

**Candidates Table**  
- Core fields: `Name`, `LinkedIn URL`, `Job Title`, `Location`, `Image URL`, `Job Searches` (linked)  
- Assessment fields: `Summary Fit Score`, `Executive Summary`, `Title Alignment`, `Skill Alignment`, `Industry Alignment`, `Seniority Alignment`, `Company Type Alignment`, `Educational Alignment`, `Potential Red Flags`, `Positive Signals`, `Final Recommendation`, `Next Steps Suggestion`  
- Outreach fields: `Email Subject`, `Email Body`, `LinkedIn Message`

## How to set up
1. **Connect credentials**  
   Add Airtable, Apollo/CRM, and OpenAI/Anthropic credentials under **n8n Credentials**.

2. **Create Airtable base/tables**  
   Follow the above spec for *Jobs* and *Candidates*. Match field names exactly to avoid mapping errors.

3. **Configure the trigger**  
   The workflow starts from a **Form/Webhook** node. It captures:  
   - Job Title (required)  
   - Job Description (required)  
   - Location (required)  
   - Target Companies (optional, comma-separated domains)

4. **Job title mutation**  
   The workflow uses an AI node to normalize the job title and generate up to 5 variations for broader candidate searches.

5. **Candidate search**  
   Apollo (or your CRM API) is queried with the generated titles and location filters. Results are deduped.

6. **AI scoring & structuring**  
   Candidates are scored 0–5 with clear reasoning (experience, industry, seniority, general fit). Profiles are formatted into structured JSON for Airtable.

7. **LinkedIn enrichment**  
   Enrichment API fetches missing data (geo, image, job history).

8. **Candidate assessment**  
   An AI model produces a full recruiter-ready evaluation (fit summary, strengths, red flags).

9. **Outreach generation**  
   The workflow drafts a concise cold email (&lt;75 words) and LinkedIn DM (&lt;60 words), consultative in tone.

10. **Write to Airtable**  
    All jobs and candidates (with assessments and outreach messages) are logged for review and integration.

## How to customize
- **Swap Apollo with your CRM** (Greenhouse, Bullhorn, etc.).  
- **Adjust scoring prompts** to match your niche (sales, engineering, healthcare).  
- **Add custom filters** for target companies or industries.  
- **Change outreach tone** to align with your brand voice.  
- **Limit by score** (e.g., only push candidates with score ≥4).  

## Security & best practices
- Store all keys in **n8n Credentials** (never in nodes).  
- Use **Set** nodes to centralize editable variables (title, location, filters).  
- Always add sticky notes in your workflow explaining steps.  
- Rename nodes clearly for readability.  

## Troubleshooting
- **No candidates found?** Loosen title variations or broaden location.  
- **Low fit scores?** Refine keywords and required skills in scoring prompts.  
- **Airtable errors?** Double-check Base ID, Table ID, and field names.  
- **API rate limits?** Enable batching/pagination and increase intervals.
