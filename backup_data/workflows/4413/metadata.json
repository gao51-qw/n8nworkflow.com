  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n* Customer support teams looking to reduce manual response time\n* SaaS companies that frequently receive product inquiries\n* E-commerce stores with common customer questions about orders, shipping, and returns\n\n## **What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\nManually responding to repetitive customer emails is inefficient, prone to inconsistency, and time-consuming. This workflow solves the issue by:\n\n* Automatically replying to real customer inquiries 24/7\n* Ensuring every response is consistent, friendly, and based on approved knowledge\n* Preventing responses to non-inquiries like newsletters or confirmations\n* Logging every interaction for traceability, analysis, and compliance\n\n## **What this workflow does**\n\nThis AI-powered Gmail auto-responder intelligently handles inbound emails with the following steps:\n\n1. **Monitors your Gmail inbox** for new incoming emails in real time\n2. **Classifies each email** as either an “Inquiry” or “Not Inquiry” using GPT-4\n3. **Gets context from a Google Sheets FAQ database**\n   The context will be used to determine the most accurate and helpful response\n4. **Generates a professional reply** only if it’s a valid inquiry (e.g., pricing, refund, product details)\n5. **Builds a context-aware, helpful response** using verified knowledge only\n6. **Sends the reply** to the original sender automatically\n7. **Logs everything** to a Google Sheet — original email, AI response, timestamp, and email address\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\nAn email comes in:\n*\"Hi, I want to know your pricing and refund policy.\"*\n\nThe workflow:\n\n* Detects it’s an inquiry\n* Finds the pricing and refund FAQs in your Google Sheet\n* Sends back a professional response like:\n  *\"Hi! Thanks for reaching out. Our pricing starts at \\$99/month. Refunds can be requested within 30 days of purchase. Let us know if you have more questions!\"*\n* Logs the interaction to your “Enquiry\\_Log” tab\n\n## **Setup**\n\n1. **Copy the Google Sheet template** here:\n   👉 [Gmail Auto-Responder – Google Sheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bZ7DTp_6-Qs6S7McyIrlMnuCvHbCrgUI-GBjz_eMpHc/edit?gid=419912118#gid=419912118)\n   This contains:\n\n   * A `FAQ_Context` tab (your knowledge base)\n   * An `Enquiry_Log` tab (interaction logs)\n\n2. **Connect your Gmail account** to the Gmail Trigger and Gmail Send nodes\n\n3. **Add your OpenAI API key** in the classification and response generator nodes\n\n4. **Link the Google Sheet** in both the FAQ lookup and logging nodes\n\n5. **Test with a sample email** — try asking a pricing and refund question to see the complete process in action\n\n\n## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n* **Adjust tone or brand voice** in the AI prompt for a more casual or formal reply\n* **Modify classification rules** if your use case includes more custom logic\n* **Expand the FAQ database** to include new questions and answers\n* **Add multilingual support** by customizing the AI prompt to detect and respond in different languages\n* **Integrate CRM or ticketing systems** (like HubSpot, Zendesk, or Notion) to log or escalate unanswered queries\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**",
