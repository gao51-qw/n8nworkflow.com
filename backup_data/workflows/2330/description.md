This n8n workflow assists property managers and surveyors by reducing the time and effort it takes to complete property inventory surveys.

In such surveys, articles and goods within a property may need to be captured and reported as a matter of record. This can take a sizable amount of time if the property or number of items is big enough.

Our solution is to delegate this task to a capable AI Agent who can identify and fill out the details of each item automatically.

## How it works

* An AirTable Base is used to capture just the image of an item within the property
* Our workflow monitoring this AirTable Base sends the photo to an AI image recognition model to describe the item for purpose of identification.
* Our AI agent uses this description and the help of Google's reverse image search in an attempt to find an online product page for the item.
* If found, the product page is scraped for the item's specifications which are then used to fill out the rest of the details of the item in our Airtable.

## Requirements

* Airtable for capturing photos and product information
* OpenAI account to for image recognition service and AI for agent
* SerpAPI account for google reverse image search.
* Firecrawl.dev account for webspacing.

## Customising this workflow

Try building an internal inventory database to query and integrate into the workflow. This could save on costs by avoiding fetching new each time for common items.
