## Brief Overview

This automation template helps you track the latest real estate listings from the LoopNet platform. By using **Scrapeless** to scrape property listings, **n8n** to orchestrate the workflow, and **Google Sheets** to store the results, you can build a **real estate data pipeline** that runs automatically on a weekly schedule.

---

## How It Works

* **Trigger on a Schedule:** The workflow runs automatically every week (can be adjusted to every 6 hours, daily, etc.).
* **Scrape Property Listings:** Scrapeless crawls the LoopNet real estate website and returns structured Markdown data.
* **Extract & Parse Content:** JavaScript nodes use regex to parse property titles, links, sizes, year built from Markdown.
* **Flatten Data:** Each property listing becomes a single row with structured fields.
* **Save to Google Sheets:** Property data is appended to your Google Sheet for easy analysis, sharing, and reporting.
