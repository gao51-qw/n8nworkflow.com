  "description": "## How it works\n\nEver wonder how to make your workflows smarter? How to handle different types of data in different ways? This template is a hands-on tutorial that teaches you the three most fundamental nodes for controlling the flow of your automations: **Merge**, **IF**, and **Switch**.\n\nTo make it easy to understand, we use a simple **package sorting center** analogy:\n*   **Data Items** are packages on a conveyor belt.\n*   The **Merge Node** is where multiple conveyor belts combine into one.\n*   The **IF Node** is a simple sorting gate with two paths (e.g., \"Fragile\" or \"Not Fragile\").\n*   The **Switch Node** is an advanced sorting machine that routes packages to many different destinations.\n\nThis workflow takes you on a step-by-step journey through the sorting center:\n\n1.  **Creating Packages:** Three different \"packages\" (two letters and one parcel) are created using Set nodes.\n2.  **Merging:** The first **Merge** node combines all three packages onto a single conveyor belt so they can be processed together.\n3.  **Simple Sorting:** An **IF** node checks if a package is fragile. If `true`, it's sent down one path; if `false`, it's sent down another.\n4.  **Re-Grouping:** After being processed separately, another **Merge** node brings the packages back together. This **\"Split &gt; Process &gt; Merge\"** pattern is a critical concept in n8n!\n5.  **Advanced Sorting:** A **Switch** node inspects each package's `destination` and routes it to the correct output (London, New York, Tokyo, or a Default bin).\n\nBy the end, you'll see how all packages have been correctly sorted, and you'll have a solid understanding of how to build intelligent, branching logic in your own workflows.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: 0 minutes!**\n\nThis template is a self-contained tutorial and requires **zero setup**.\n\n1.  There are no credentials or external services to configure.\n2.  Simply click the **\"Execute Workflow\"** button.\n3.  Follow the flow from left to right, clicking on each node to see its output and reading the detailed sticky notes to understand what's happening at each stage.",
