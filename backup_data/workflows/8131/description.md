## How it works  
This workflow fetches articles from any RSS feed, processes them with an AI model (DeepSeek), and sends only the most relevant alerts directly to Slack.  

- Normalizes and deduplicates RSS items  
- Extracts article text and cleans HTML  
- Summarizes and classifies with AI (sentiment + flags)  
- Filters out irrelevant news  
- Sends real-time alerts to your Slack channel  

## Setup steps  
- Add your Slack Bot Token (via Slack API)  
- Add your DeepSeek API Key  
- Import this workflow into n8n  
- Deploy and start receiving smart news alerts in Slack  

## Use case
