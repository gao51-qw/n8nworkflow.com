*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*

This workflow automatically monitors competitor product launches across news sites, press releases, and social channels. It saves you hours of manual tracking and ensures your team is instantly alerted when a rival announces something new.

## Overview

The automation regularly scrapes predefined sources for mentions of your competitors combined with launch-related keywords. Bright Data provides reliable scraping, while OpenAI analyzes each article to extract key details (product name, features, launch date, pricing). Summaries are pushed to Slack and logged in Google Sheets so your marketing and product teams can react quickly.
