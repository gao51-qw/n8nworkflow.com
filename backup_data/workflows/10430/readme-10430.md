# Automate employee birthdays & work anniversaries with Google Gemini and Slack

> # Replace BillyBot: Free Slack Employee Birthday & Anniversary Automation

## Who's it for

HR teams, team leaders, and operations managers looking to automate employee celebrations without expensive third-party tools like BillyBot. Perfect for startups to enterprise teams wanting to save $600-2,400+ annually while maintaining personalized, engaging employee recognition.

## What it does

This workflow automatically monitors your employee database daily and posts AI-generated, unique celebration messages to Slack for birthdays and work anniversaries. Unlike generic bots, it creates personalized messages that never repeat, rotating through 12 different styles and tones to keep celebrations fresh and authentic.

## How it works

1. **Daily Check**: Runs every morning at 9 AM to scan your employee Google Sheet
2. **Smart Filtering**: Matches today's date against employee birthdays and joining dates
3. **Data Aggregation**: Collects all celebrating employees into a single payload
4. **AI Generation**: Google Gemini creates unique, heartfelt messages with proper Slack formatting
5. **Auto-Post**: Sends personalized celebrations directly to your chosen Slack channel

The AI ensures no two messages feel templated, calculating years of service for anniversaries and adapting tone based on tenure length.

## Requirements

- **Google Sheets** with employee data (columns: NO, Name, Email, Date of Birth, Joining Date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Slack workspace** with bot permissions to post messages
- **Google Gemini API key** (free tier included)
- **n8n Cloud** ($20/month) or self-hosted n8n (free)

## Cost comparison: Save $600-2,400+ per year

**BillyBot pricing**: $1 per employee/month
- 50 employees = $600/year
- 100 employees = $1,200/year  
- 200 employees = $2,400/year

**This solution**: $0-20/month (unlimited employees)
- Google Gemini API: FREE
- Google Sheets API: FREE
- Slack API: FREE
- n8n: $20/month (Cloud) or $0 (self-hosted)

**Your savings**: 95-100% cost reduction regardless of team size.
