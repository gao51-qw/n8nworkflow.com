  "description": "## YouTube Chapter Auto-Description with AI\n\nThis n8n template automatically adds structured timestamp chapters to your latest YouTube video’s **description** using your RSS feed, SupaData for transcript extraction, and an AI tool for chapter generation.\n\nIdeal for creators who want every video to include chapter markers without doing it manually.\n\n---\n\n### Good to Know\n\n- SupaData extracts full transcripts from YouTube videos via URL.\n- The AI chapter generator converts long transcripts into formatted timestamps with short titles.\n- This workflow edits the existing **video description** and appends the chapters to the bottom.\n\n---\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. The **RSS Feed Trigger** detects new uploads from your YouTube channel.\n2. The workflow checks Airtable to prevent duplicate processing.\n3. Transcript is fetched using **SupaData API**.\n4. The total video duration is extracted from the transcript.\n5. AI is prompted to generate well-formatted chapter timestamps.\n6. The existing description is fetched from YouTube.\n7. The chapters are appended and pushed back via the YouTube API.\n\n---\n\n### How to Use\n\n- Start with the **Manual Trigger** to test the setup.\n- Replace it with the **RSS Trigger** once you're ready for automation.\n- Chapters are added only if the video hasn't been processed before.\n\n---\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **YouTube OAuth2** credentials in n8n\n- **SupaData API Key**\n- **Airtable account** (for optional deduplication logic)\n\n---\n\n### Customizing This Workflow\n\n- Change the chapter format, or instruct the AI to use emojis, bold titles, or include sections like \"sponsor\" or \"Q&A\".\n- Replace the RSS Trigger with a webhook if using a different publishing process.",
