  "description": "## 📌 Who’s it for\n\nThis subworkflow is designed for **developers, AI engineers, or automation builders who generate dynamic HTML content in their workflows** (e.g. reports, dashboards, emails) and want a simple way to host and share it via a clean URL, without spinning up infrastructure or uploading to a CMS.\n\nIt’s **especially useful when combined with AI agents that generate HTML** content as part of a larger automated pipeline.\n\n## ⚙️ What it does\n\nThis subworkflow:\n\n1. Accepts raw HTML content as input.\n2. Creates a new **GitHub Gist** with that content.\n3. Returns the shareable Gist URL, which can then be sent via Slack, Telegram, email, etc.\n\nThe result is a lightweight, fast, and free way to publish AI-generated HTML (such as reports, articles, or formatted data outputs) to the web.\n\n## 🛠️ How to set it up\n\n1. Add this subworkflow to any parent workflow where HTML is generated.\n2. Pass in a string of valid HTML via the `html` input parameter.\n3. Configure the GitHub credentials in the HTTP node using an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `gist` scope.\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n\n- GitHub account and personal access token with `gist` permissions\n\n## 🔧 How to customize\n\n- Change the filename (`report.html`) if your use case needs a different format or extension.\n- Add metadata to the Gist (e.g., description, tags).\n",
