  "description": "## **Who is this for?**\n\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n\n* **HR professionals** seeking to automate employee and department management\n* **Startups and SMBs** that want an AI-powered HR assistant on Telegram\n* **Internal operations teams** that want to simplify onboarding and employee data tracking\n\n---\n\n## **What problem is this workflow solving?**\n\nManaging employee databases manually is error-prone and inefficient—especially for growing teams. This workflow solves that by:\n\n* Enabling **natural language-based HR operations** directly through Telegram\n* Automating the **creation, retrieval, and deletion** of employee records in Airtable\n* Dynamically managing related data such as **departments and job titles**\n* Handling **data consistency** and linking across relational tables automatically\n* Providing a conversational interface backed by **OpenAI** for smart decision-making\n\n---\n\n## **What this workflow does**\n\nUsing Telegram as the interface and Airtable as the backend database, this intelligent HR workflow allows users to:\n\n1. **Chat in natural language** (e.g. “Show me all employees” or “Create employee: Sarah, Marketing…”)\n2. **Interpret and route requests** via an AI Agent that acts as the orchestrator\n3. **Query employee, department, and job title data** from Airtable\n4. **Create or update records** as needed:\n\n   * Add new departments and job titles automatically if they don’t exist\n   * Create new employees and link them to the correct department and job title\n5. **Delete employees** based on ID\n6. **Respond directly in Telegram**, providing user-friendly feedback\n\n---\n\n## **Setup**\n1. **View & Copy the Airtable base** here:\n   👉 [Employee Database Management – Airtable Base Template](https://airtable.com/appgVjZcaRP8BsKf0/shrQAqQ2JUW50EEyW)\n\n2. **Telegram Bot**: Set up a Telegram bot and connect it to the Telegram Trigger node\n\n3. **Airtable**: Prepare three Airtable tables:\n\n   * `Employees` with links to Departments and Job Titles\n   * `Departments` with Name & Description\n   * `Job Titles` with Title & Description\n\n4. **Connect your Airtable API key** and base/table IDs into the appropriate Airtable nodes\n\n5. **Add your OpenAI API key** to the AI Agent nodes\n\n6. **Deploy both workflows**: the main chatbot workflow and the employee creation sub-workflow\n\n7. **Test with sample messages** like:\n\n   * “Create employee: John Doe, [john@company.com](mailto:john@company.com), Engineering, Software Engineer”\n   * “Remove employee ID rec123xyz”\n\n---\n\n## **How to customize this workflow to your needs**\n\n* **Switch databases**: Replace Airtable with Notion, PostgreSQL, or Google Sheets if desired\n* **Enhance security**: Add authentication and validation before allowing deletion\n* **Add approval flows**: Integrate Telegram button-based approvals for sensitive actions\n* **Multi-language support**: Expand system prompts to support multiple languages\n* **Add logging**: Store every user action in a log table for auditability\n* **Expand capabilities**: Integrate payroll, time tracking, or Slack notifications\n\n---\n\n## **Extra Tips**\n\n* This is a **two-workflow setup**. Make sure the sub-workflow is deployed and accessible from the main agent.\n* Use **Simple Memory** per chat ID to preserve context across user queries.\n* You can expand the orchestration logic by adding more tools to the main agent—such as “Get active employees only” or “List employees by job title.”\n\n---\n\n**Contact me for consulting and support:**   \n📧 **billychartanto@gmail.com**",
