  "title": "Automate a 'Chat with your PDF' Bot on Telegram with Google Gemini & Pinecone",
  "description": "## This n8n template from [Intuz](https://www.intuz.com/) provides a complete solution to automate a powerful, AI-driven 'Chat with your PDF' bot on Telegram.\n\nIt uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to allow users to upload documents, which are then indexed into a vector database, enabling the bot to answer questions based only on the provided content.\n\n## Who's this workflow for?\n- Researchers & Students\n- Legal & Compliance Teams\n- Business Analysts & Financial Advisors\n- Anyone needing to quickly find information within large documents\n\n## How it works\nThis workflow has two primary functions: indexing a new document and answering questions about it.\n\n**1. Uploading & Indexing a Document:**\n- A user sends a PDF file to the Telegram bot.\n- n8n downloads the document, extracts the text, and splits it into small, manageable chunks.\n- Using Google Gemini, each text chunk is converted into a numerical representation (an \"embedding\").\n- These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database, making the document's content searchable.\n- The bot sends a confirmation message to the user that the document has been successfully saved.\n\n**2. Asking a Question (RAG):**\n- A user sends a regular text message (a question) to the bot.\n- n8n converts the user's question into an embedding using Google Gemini.\n- It then searches the Pinecone database to find the most relevant text chunks from the uploaded PDF that match the question.\n- These relevant chunks (the \"context\") are sent to the Gemini chat model along with the original question.\n- Gemini generates a new, accurate answer based only on the provided context and sends it back to the user in Telegram.\n\n## Key Requirements to Use This Template\n\n**1. n8n Instance & Required Nodes:**\n- An active n8n account (Cloud or self-hosted).\n- This workflow uses the official n8n LangChain integration (@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain). If you are using a self-hosted version of n8n, please ensure this package is installed.\n\n**2. Telegram Account:**\n- A Telegram bot created via the BotFather, along with its API token.\n\n**3. Google Gemini AI Account:**\n- A Google Cloud account with the Vertex AI API enabled and an associated API Key.\n\n**4. Pinecone Account:**\n- A Pinecone account with an API key.\n- You must have a vector index created in Pinecone. For use with Google Gemini's embedding-001 model, the index must be configured with 768 dimensions.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n**1. Telegram Configuration:**\n- In the \"Telegram Message Trigger\" node, create a new credential and add your Telegram bot's API token.\n- Do the same for the \"Telegram Response\" and \"Telegram Response about Database\" nodes.\n\n**2. Pinecone Configuration:**\n- In both \"Pinecone Vector Store\" nodes, create a new credential and add your Pinecone API key.\n- In the \"Index\" field of both nodes, enter the name of your pre-configured Pinecone index (e.g., telegram).\n\n**3. Google Gemini Configuration:**\n- In all three Google Gemini nodes (Embeddings Google Gemini, Embeddings Google Gemini1, and Google Gemini Chat Model), create a new credential and add your Google Gemini (Palm) API key.\n\n**4. Activate and Use:**\n- Save the workflow and toggle the \"Active\" switch to ON.\n- To use: First, send a PDF document to your bot. Wait for the confirmation message. Then, you can start asking questions about the content of that PDF.\n\n## Connect with us\n- Website: https://www.intuz.com/services\n- Email: getstarted@intuz.com\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuz\n- Get Started: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/intuz\n\n## For Custom Workflow Automation\nClick here- [Get Started](https://www.intuz.com/get-started)",
