***Workflow Description***
Automate your candidate interview pipeline with precision.
This powerful integration pulls booking data from Cal.com, extracts interview details (name, email, date & time), and syncs them directly into your Google Sheets tracker. It matches applicants using email, formats the date in the Asia/Riyadh timezone, and appends only relevant entries.

But it doesn’t stop there — it cleans your sheet automatically by removing unmatched or empty records, ensuring your data stays clean, reliable, and ready for HR decisions.

 What it does:
 Fetches interview bookings from Cal.com

 Converts time to readable format (e.g. 30 June, 09:00 AM)

 Matches booking emails with existing applicant records

 Auto-updates interview date in your sheet

 Detects and deletes irrelevant or blank entries

 **Use Cases:**
Resume screening workflows that require automated interview sync

HR dashboards needing real-time calendar updates

Applicant pipelines where only valid interviews should remain

**Ideal for:**
Recruiters • HR teams • Automation architects • Remote hiring pipelines
