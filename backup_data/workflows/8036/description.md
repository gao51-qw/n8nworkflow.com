## Automatically track your Android app’s keyword rankings on Google Play. This workflow checks ranks via SerpApi, updates a Baserow table, and posts a heads-up in Slack so your team can review changes quickly.

## 💡 Perfect for

- ASO teams tracking daily keyword positions

- Growth & marketing standups that want quick rank visibility

- Lightweight historical logging without a full BI stack

## 🧠 What it does

- Runs on a schedule (e.g., weekly)

- Queries SerpApi for each keyword’s Play Store ranking

- Saves results to Baserow: Current Rank, Previous Rank, Last modified

- Sends a Slack alert: “Ranks updated — review in Baserow”

## ⚡ Requirements

- SerpApi account & API key

- Baserow account + API token

- Slack connection (bot/app or credential in n8n)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1) **Create a Baserow table**

Create a new table (any name). Add user-field names exactly:

- Keywords (text)

- Current Rank (number)

- Previous Rank (number)

- Last modified (date/time)

Optional fields you can add later: Notes, Locale, Store Country, App Package ID.

2) **Connect credentials in n8n**

- Baserow: add your API token and select your Database and Table in the Baserow nodes.

- Slack: connect your Slack account/workspace in the Slack node.

- SerpApi: open the HTTP Request node and put your API key under Query Parameters → api_key = YOUR_KEY.

3) **Verify field mapping**

- In the Baserow (Update Row) node, map:

- Row ID → {{$json.id}}

- Current Rank → {{$json["Current Rank"]}}

- Previous Rank → your code node should set this (the template copies the old “Current Rank” into “Previous Rank” before writing the new one)

- Last modified → {{$now}} (or the timestamp you compute)

## 🛟 Notes & Tips

If you prefer a single daily Slack summary instead of multiple pings, add a Code node after updates to aggregate lines and send one message.

Treat 0 or missing ranks as “not found” and flag them in Slack if helpful.

For multi-country tracking, include hl/gl (locale/country) in your SerpApi query params and store them as columns.
