  "description": "# AI Comprehensive Research on User's Query with Gemini and Web Search\n\n## What is this?\nPerform comprehensive research on a user's query by dynamically generating search terms, querying the web using Google Search (by Gemini) , reflecting on the results to identify knowledge gaps, and iteratively refining its search until it can provide a well-supported answer with citations. (like Perplexity)\n\nThis workflow is a reproduction of `gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart` in **N8N**.\n\nThe [`gemini‑fullstack‑langgraph‑quickstart`](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart) is a demo by the Google‑Gemini team that showcases how to build a powerful full‑stack AI agent using Gemini and LangGraph\n\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Generate Query 💬\n- generates one or more search queries tasks based on the User's question.\n- uses Gemini 2.0 Flash\n\n### Web Research 🌐\n- execute web search tasks using the native Google Search API tool in combination with Gemini 2.0 Flash.\n\n### Reflection 📚\n- Identifies knowledge gaps and generates potential follow-up queries. \n\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Configure API Credentials:**\n   - Create Google Gemini(PaLM) Api Credential using you own Gemini key\n   - Connect the credential with three nodes: `Google Gemini Chat Model` and `GeminiSearch` and `reflection`\n\n2. **Configure Redis Source:**\n   - prepare a Redis service that can be accessed by n8n\n   - Create Redis Crediential and connect it with all Redis node\n\n## Customize\n\n- Try using different Gemini models.\n- Try modifying the parameters `number_of_initial_queries` and `max_research_loops`.\n\n\n\n## Why use Redis?\n\nUse Redis as an external storage to maintain global variables (counter, search results, etc.)\n\nThis workflow contains a loop process, which need global variables (as `State` in LangGraph).\n\nIt is difficult to achieve global variables management without external storage in n8n.\n",
