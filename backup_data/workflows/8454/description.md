- Provides service information (name, description, price) from a Google Sheet.  
- Schedules appointments by:
  - Asking the customer which service they want.  
  - Collecting their preferred day and time.  
  - Checking Google Calendar for available slots.  
  - Offering 3 options and letting the customer choose.
