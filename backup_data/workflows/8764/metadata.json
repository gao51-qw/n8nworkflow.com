  "description": "## 📄 What this workflow does\n This workflow turns your n8n into an automated product-video generator powered by Google Sheets. When a new row is added with status = run, it:\n\n- Downloads the product image from Google Drive.\n- Converts the image to base64 and sends it to Gemini, which creates a branded ad-style variant.\n- Saves the generated image back into a designated Google Drive folder.\n- Sends the image to FAL (image-to-video) to generate a short promotional video clip.\n- Polls FAL’s response_url until the video is ready.\n- Uploads the video to Google Drive (videos folder).\n- Updates the original Google Sheet row with the video link and sets status = finished.\n- Handles API latency via wait/polling and logs failures into the sheet if needed.\n\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n- Marketing teams automating creative asset production.\n- E-commerce businesses needing quick product promo videos.\n- Agencies creating branded ad content at scale.\n\n\n## ✅ Requirements\n- An n8n instance.\n- A Google Sheet with at least these columns: STT, link_image, note, status, link_video.\n- Google Sheets & Google Drive OAuth2 credentials connected in n8n.\n- Gemini API key (for ad-style image generation).\n- FAL API key (for image-to-video).\n\n\n⚙️ How to set up\n1. Import the provided workflow JSON into n8n.\n2. Connect Google Sheets credentials and point to your sheet (documentId + gid).\n3. Connect Google Drive credentials and update folder IDs in the two Upload File nodes (images/videos).\n4. Add Gemini and FAL API keys in the respective HTTP Request headers (via Credentials).\n5. Test: add a row with link_image, note, and status = run. The workflow should generate and save a video, then update the sheet with the link.\n\n\n🔁 How it works\n- Trigger → Google Sheets Trigger fires on rowAdded where status = run.\n- Pre-processing → Download the product image from Google Drive → extract base64.\n- LLM Image Generation → Gemini generates an ad-style variant based on note.\n- Storage → Upload the generated image into the “images” Drive folder.\n- Video Creation → FAL converts the branded image into a short video.\n- Polling → Wait node + HTTP Request check job status until video is completed.\n- Write-back → Upload final video into the “videos” Drive folder, update the sheet with the link_video, and set status = finished.\n",
