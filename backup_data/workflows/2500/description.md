## Who is this template for?

This template can be used by any automator who wants to **create a workitem(incident/user story/bugs)** in **azure devops** whenever an alert raised by systems.

## How it works

- Each time an alert raised in system( for ex: Elastic raises an alert for missing host or domain).
- Workflow reads an alert and creates a workitem in **azure devops**
- Workflow can be customized to send any required information as possible in **azure devops**

## Setup Instructions
- **Azure DevOps Organization and Project:** Make sure you have access to an Azure DevOps organization and a project where the work item will be created.
- **Personal Access Token (PAT):** You need a Personal Access Token with permissions to create work items. You can generate a PAT from the Azure DevOps user settings.
