This workflow is the second of three. You can find the other workflkows here:

1. [Incident Response Workflow - Part 1](https://n8n.io/workflows/353)
2. [Incident Response Workflow - Part 2](https://n8n.io/workflows/354)
3. [Incident Response Workflow - Part 3](https://n8n.io/workflows/355)


We have the following nodes in the workflow:
1. Webhook node: This trigger node listens to the event when the Acknowledge button is clicked.
2. PagerDuty node: This node changes the status of the incident report from 'Triggered' to 'Acknowledged' in PagerDuty.
3. Mattermost node: This node publishes a message in the auxiliary channel saying that the status of the incident report has been changed to Acknowledged.
