  "description": "## This workflow generates a weekly performance summary from Google Search Console, focused on brand-level SEO metrics and week-over-week trends.\n\nIt provides a structured view of how each brand segment is performing, with clean formatting for quick insights.\n\nKey Features\n- Sends a weekly email with a table showing clicks, impressions, CTR, and position — along with % change vs. the previous week.\n- Highlights both brand and non-brand clicks separately.\n- Color-coded % changes make it easy to spot wins (green) and losses (red) at a glance.\n\nIt’s designed to give SEO teams a consistent overview of performance by brand, helping to track directional shifts and support deeper analysis when needed.\n\n### How it works\n1. Runs weekly (e.g. every Monday) to compare “Last Week” vs. “2 Weeks Ago” from GSC data.\n2. Includes both brand + non-brand click breakdown.\n3. Calculates raw values and week-over-week % change for clicks, impressions, CTR, and position.\n4. Outputs a clean, formatted table with labeled rows and color-coded changes.\n5. Sends the table as part of a scheduled email (can also be adapted for Slack or other channels).\n\n### Setup steps\n- Requires connected Google Search Console data (per brand segment).\n- Email delivery is included by default (customizable to other platforms).\n- Update brand segmentation logic to match your tracking needs (e.g. domain, label, or custom filters).\n- Typical setup time: ~5-10 minutes with structured input data.\n",
