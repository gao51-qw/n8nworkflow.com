This workflow is aimed at generating keywords for SEO and articles
To get started, you need to use the workflow as it is. You just call the webhook URL with a query parameter as q={{ $keywords}}
For example, you can call it using ?q=keyword research
This will give you a list of keywords back as an array.
This system can be used by SEO pros, content marketers and also social media marketers to generate relevant keywords for their user needs
