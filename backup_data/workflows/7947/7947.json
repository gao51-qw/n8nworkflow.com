Create an OpenAI account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)\n2. Generate API key from the API Keys section\n3. In n8n, create new OpenAI credentials using your API key\n4. Test connection to ensure GPT-4 access\n\n#### Tavily Research Setup\n1. Sign up at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com)\n2. Get your API key from the dashboard\n3. Add Tavily credentials in n8n\n4. Configure search depth to \"advanced\" for best results\n\n#### Google Services Setup\n1. Create Google Cloud Project\n2. Enable Google Drive API and Google Sheets API\n3. Create OAuth2 credentials\n4. Configure Google Drive and Google Sheets credentials in n8n\n5. Share your input spreadsheet with the service account\n\n#### NextCloud Setup\n1. Install NextCloud or use hosted solution\n2. Create application password for API access\n3. Configure NextCloud credentials in n8n\n4. Create `/images/` folder for content storage\n\n#### Supabase Setup\n1. Create Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)\n2. Create table with the following structure:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE works (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  title TEXT NOT NULL,\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\n  image_url TEXT,\n  category TEXT,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\n);\n```\n3. Get project URL and service key from settings\n4. Configure Supabase credentials in n8n\n\n### ## Step 2: Google Sheets Input Setup\n\nCreate a Google Sheets document with the following columns:\n- **TITLE**: Topic or title for content generation\n- **IMAGE_URL**: Google Drive sharing URL for associated image\n\nExample format:\n```\nTITLE                           | IMAGE_URL\nAI Chatbot Implementation       | https://drive.google.com/file/d/your-file-id/view\nDigital Marketing Trends 2024   | https://drive.google.com/file/d/another-file-id/view\n```\n\n### ## Step 3: Workflow Import and Configuration\n\n1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance\n2. Configure all credential connections:\n   - Link OpenAI credentials to \"OpenAI_GPT4_Model\" node\n   - Link Tavily credentials to \"Tavily_Research_Agent\" node\n   - Link Google credentials to \"Google_Sheets_Trigger\" and \"Google_Drive_Image_Downloader\" nodes\n   - Link NextCloud credentials to \"NextCloud_Image_Uploader\" and \"NextCloud_Public_URL_Generator\" nodes\n   - Link Supabase credentials to \"Supabase_Content_Storage\" node\n\n3.
