🧾 Say goodbye to manual Venmo-to-QuickBooks formatting!
This automated workflow transforms raw Venmo CSV exports into QuickBooks-ready files and backs them up seamlessly to Google Drive or Dropbox.

⚙️ What This Workflow Does:

📤 1. Accepts a Venmo CSV Upload
— Triggers on form submission to upload a .csv Venmo transaction file.

📂 2. Extracts Raw CSV Data
— Reads the uploaded file and prepares it for processing.

🛠️ 3. Generates a Smart File Name
— Dynamically names the output file using the transaction month and timestamp:
QB_Venmo_YYYY-MM_HHMM.csv.

🔄 4. Converts Raw Venmo Data
— Filters invalid rows and transforms valid transactions into QuickBooks-friendly format:
 • Standardizes field names (e.g., Amount (total) → Amount)
 • Builds descriptive transaction summaries based on context (e.g., transfers vs payments)

📝 5. Creates a New CSV File
— Structures the processed data into a new downloadable CSV.

☁️ 6. Saves to Google Drive
— Automatically uploads the finalized file to your selected folder in Google Drive.

📦 7. (Optional) Backs Up to Dropbox
— Also configured to upload to Dropbox (currently disabled).
