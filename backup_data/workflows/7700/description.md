# 🗓 Preventive Maintenance Scheduler via ICS Email (n8n | Google Sheets | Gmail)

This workflow automatically reads your daily preventive maintenance schedule from Google Sheets and sends each assigned team member a personalized calendar invite (.ICS) as an email attachment. No more manual reminders or copying events — your operations and field teams will always be on schedule with clear, actionable reminders!

## Who’s it For

- Maintenance teams at plants, renewable sites, factories.
- Facility and operations managers.
- Any field crew, service team or org using Google Sheets and email for coordination.
- Businesses wanting reliable, zero-touch preventive maintenance notifications.

## How it Works

1. **Daily Trigger:** Workflow runs automatically every morning at 7:00 AM.
2. **Read Maintenance Tasks:** Pulls all scheduled maintenance for *today* from Google Sheets.
3. **Generate ICS Data:** Prepares universal calendar event details: summary, location, time, assignee, etc.
4. **Create ICS File:** Converts event data into a standard `.ics` calendar invite file with correct timings and description.
5. **Send Calendar Invite Email:** Sends a personalized email to each assignee, with the `.ics` file attached — ready to add to Outlook, Gmail or mobile calendar.

## How to Set Up

1. **Import the workflow JSON** into your n8n instance.
2. **Set up connections in n8n:**
- Authenticate Google Sheets (read access) and Gmail (send access).
3. **Format your Google Sheet** with headers:
`date`, `asset`, `task`, `location`, `email`
4. **Activate the workflow.** It runs daily on schedule. You can test it manually for validation.
5. **Each day**: Team members with tasks scheduled for that date are sent their personalized event invite.

## Common Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| Calendar file comes as .txt | Wrong file type/extension/MIME | Ensure "Create ICS File" outputs `.ics` and `text/calendar` |
| No invites sent for today | No matching rows in Google Sheet | Check date/value format; add sample data for today |
| Google Sheets returns error | Wrong Sheet ID/tab, access issue | Confirm correct Google Sheet is linked and shared |
| Event time/zone is incorrect | Code node’s time logic not matching | Adjust start/end time settings in the code node |
