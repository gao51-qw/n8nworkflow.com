Automatically discover trending developer and security topics, generate SEO-optimized blog posts, and publish them to WordPress as drafts — complete with AI-generated featured images.

### How it works
1. **Discover trends** — Perplexity AI identifies the hottest topic from the last 24-48 hours
2. **Queue topics** — Topics are saved to Google Sheets for tracking and management
3. **Generate content** — Perplexity creates complete blog posts with titles, sections, keywords, and meta descriptions
4. **Create draft** — Content is published as a WordPress draft for your review
5. **Generate image** — HuggingFace FLUX creates a featured image based on the content
6. **Attach media** — The image is uploaded to WordPress and assigned to the post

### Setup steps
1. Add credentials for Perplexity AI, Google Sheets, WordPress, and HuggingFace
2. Create a Google Sheet with columns: `Topic`, `is_generated`, `title`, `content`, `keywords`, `meta_description`
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in the Google Sheets nodes with your sheet ID
4. Replace `your-site.com` with your WordPress site URL
5. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your HuggingFace API token
6. Update the `authorId` in the WordPress node to match your author
