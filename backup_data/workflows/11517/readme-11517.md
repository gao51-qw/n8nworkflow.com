# Automate champion migration detection & personalized outreach with Explorium & Claude

> # Champion Migration Tracker

Automatically detect when your champion contacts change companies and respond with intelligent, personalized AI outreach before your competitors do.

## THE PROBLEM

When champions move to new companies, sales teams lose track and miss high-value opportunities. Manual LinkedIn monitoring doesn't scale, and by the time you notice, the relationship has gone cold.

## THE SOLUTION

This workflow automates champion migration tracking end-to-end, combining Explorium's data intelligence with Claude AI agents to maintain relationships and prioritize opportunities.

## HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Automated Job Change Detection
- Uses Explorium person enrichment to detect when champions move companies
- Eliminates manual LinkedIn monitoring
- Triggers immediately when employment changes

### 2. Intelligent Company Enrichment
- Enriches new companies with Explorium data: firmographics, funding, tech stack, hiring velocity
- Checks if company already exists in your CRM (Customer vs Prospect)
- Identifies open opportunities and account owners

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Opportunity Scoring (0-100)
- **ICP Fit (40%)**: Company size, funding stage, revenue, tech stack alignment
- **Relationship Strength (40%)**: Past deals influenced, relationship warmth, CRM status
- **Timing (20%)**: Days at new company, recent funding/acquisition signals
- Results in Hot/Warm/Cold priority classification

### 4. Smart Routing by Context
- **Customers**: Notify account manager with congratulations message
- **Hot Prospects (75+ score)**: Draft detailed strategic outreach for rep review

### 5. AI-Powered Personalization
- Claude AI agents generate contextually relevant emails
- References past relationship, deals influenced, and company intelligence
- Adapts tone and content based on opportunity priority and CRM status

## DEMO SETUP (Google Sheets)

This demo uses Google Sheets for simplicity. **For production use, replace with your actual CRM:**
- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- Pipedrive
- Any CRM with n8n integration

### Important Fields to Consider:

**Champions:**
- `champion_id`, `name`, `email`, `company`, `title`, `last_checked_date`
- `relationship_strength` (Hot/Warm/Cold), `last_contact_date`, `deals_influenced`
- `relationship_notes`, `isChampion` (TRUE/FALSE), `linkedin_url`, `explorium_prospect_id`

**Companies:**
- `company_ID`, `companyName`, `domain`, `relationship_type` (Customer/Prospect/None)
- `open_opportunity` (TRUE/FALSE), `opportunity_stage`, `account_owner`, `account_owner_email`
- `contractValue`, `notes`, `ExploriumBusinessID`

## REQUIRED CREDENTIALS
