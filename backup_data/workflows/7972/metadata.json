  "description": "# AI Assistant Workflow: Create Notion Workspaces from Notes & Voice Records\n\n## 👤 Who is this for?\nThis workflow is designed for **anyone who loves Notion**—from project managers, freelancers, to students—who want to turn scattered ideas, handwritten notes, or quick thoughts into fully structured Notion databases **without the hassle of manual setup**.\n\n## 😩 The Problem\nYou have a brilliant idea jotted down during a meeting or on a piece of paper.  \nBut turning that into a structured Notion workspace (for project management, CRM, habit tracking, recipes, etc.) is **time-consuming and disruptive**.  \n\nDesigning properties, configuring views, and entering sample data can interrupt your creative flow and slow down execution.\n\n## ⚡️ How It Works\nThis workflow acts as a **smart AI assistant** that automatically builds a full Notion workspace from just a simple note or voice record.\n\n1. **Notes & Upload**  \n   - Snap a picture of your handwritten notes or type a quick description of what you want to manage.  \n   - Upload it into a Google Drive folder.\n\n2. **AI Reads & Understands**  \n   - **Step 1:** Google Gemini AI converts handwritten notes into text (OCR).  \n   - **Step 2:** Another AI (OpenAI/Vertex AI) analyzes the intent—figuring out whether you want a project plan, a CRM contact list, or maybe a recipe collection.\n\n3. **AI Designs & Builds**  \n   - A specialized AI then **designs the database structure**, including:  \n     - Properties (date, status, assignee, tags, etc.)  \n     - Dropdown options  \n     - Useful views (Table, Kanban Board, Calendar, Gallery)  \n\n4. **Database Creation & Sample Data**  \n   - The system **creates the database in your Notion** automatically.  \n   - Fills it with realistic sample entries so you can start working immediately.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Detailed Workflow Steps\n\n### 🔄 Automated Flow\n1. **Trigger & Read Notes**  \n   - Workflow starts when a file (image or text) is uploaded to a Google Drive folder.  \n   - Gemini AI extracts text from handwritten notes.\n\n2. **Track Request**  \n   - System generates a unique Request ID.  \n   - Creates a new page in a Notion tracking database `\"Agent Notes\"` with status = `\"Not started\"`.\n\n3. **AI Intent Analysis**  \n   - An AI Agent analyzes the extracted text to identify:  \n     - Content type (e.g., `project_management`, `crm_contacts`, `inventory_tracking`)  \n     - Complexity level (scale 1–5)  \n     - Suggested database title, description, and icon  \n\n4. **AI Database Design**  \n   - Another AI Agent designs the structure:  \n     - **Schema:** Names and types for each property (column)  \n     - **Sample Data:** 5–10 rows of context-appropriate sample entries (localized for Vietnam if needed)  \n     - **Views:** Recommendations for Table, Board, Calendar, Gallery, etc.  \n\n5. **Database Creation**  \n   - AI output is formatted for Notion API.  \n   - Workflow creates a new inline database inside the tracking page.\n\n6. **Insert Sample Data**  \n   - Workflow iterates over the AI-generated sample rows and inserts them into the new database.\n\n7. **Completion**  \n   - Updates the status of the `\"Agent Notes\"` page to `\"Done\"`.  \n   - Records completion time.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Setup Instructions\n\n### 1. 📝 Configure Notion\n- Create a new **Integration** in Notion (`My Integrations`) → Copy the **Internal Integration Token**.  \n- Create a database named `\"Agent Notes\"` with properties:  \n  - `Name (Title)`  \n  - `Status (Status)`  \n  - `Request ID (Text)`  \n  - `Last Updated (Date)`  \n- Share `\"Agent Notes\"` with your integration.  \n- Copy the database ID from the URL.\n\n### 2. 📁 Configure Google Drive\n- Create a new folder in Google Drive (e.g., `\"Notes for Notion\"`).  \n- Copy the folder ID from the URL.\n\n### 3. 🔧 Setup in n8n\n- Import the workflow into your **n8n** instance.  \n- Add credentials for **Notion, Google Drive, and OpenAI/Google AI (Vertex)**.  \n- Update configuration in nodes:  \n  - **Google Drive Trigger** → Paste your Drive folder ID  \n  - **Notion Nodes** (`Create Row`, `Get Row`) → Paste `\"Agent Notes\"` database ID  \n  - **AI Nodes** → Ensure correct credentials are selected\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Usage Example\nImagine you want to manage your recipes.  \n\n1. Write on paper: Create a recipe collection.\nNeeded fields: Dish name, Ingredients, Cooking time, Difficulty (easy/medium/hard), Type (main/dessert), Picture.\n\n\n2. Take a photo and upload it to the configured Google Drive folder.  \n\n3. Wait a few minutes.  \n\n4. A new database **“Recipe Collection 🍲”** will appear in Notion, with:  \n- Columns already set up  \n- Sample recipes filled in  \n- Useful views (Table, Gallery, Calendar)\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Key Benefits\n- No manual setup required  \n- Transforms messy notes into structured, usable data  \n- Works with both **handwritten notes** and **typed text**  \n- Saves time, maintains creative flow, and boosts productivity\n",
