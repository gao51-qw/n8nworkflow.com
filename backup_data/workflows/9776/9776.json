    "description": "This workflow is a complete, AI-powered content engine designed to help automation experts build their personal brand on LinkedIn. It transforms a technical n8n workflow (in JSON format) into a polished, engaging LinkedIn post, complete with a custom-generated AI image and a strategic call-to-action.\n\nThis system acts as your personal content co-pilot, handling the creative heavy lifting so you can focus on building, not just writing.\n\n\n## Who’s it for?\nThis template is for n8n developers, automation consultants, and tech content creators who want to consistently showcase their work on LinkedIn but lack the time or desire to write marketing copy and design visuals from scratch. If you want to turn your projects into high-quality content with minimal effort, this is your solution.\n\n## How it works\nThis workflow is divided into two main parts that work together through Telegram:\n\n**Content Generation & Image Creation:**\nYou send an n8n workflow's JSON file to your first Telegram bot.\n\nThe workflow sends the JSON to Google Gemini with a sophisticated prompt, instructing it to analyze the workflow and write a compelling LinkedIn post in one of two high-engagement styles (\"Builder\" or \"Strategist\").\n\nGemini also generates a detailed prompt for an AI image model, including a specific headline to be embedded in the visual.\n\nThis image prompt is then sent to the Cloudflare Workers AI model to generate a unique, high-quality image for your post.\n\nThe final image and the AI-generated text prompt are sent back to you via Telegram for review.\n\n**Posting to LinkedIn:**\nYou use a second Telegram bot for publishing.\n\nSimply reply to the image you received from the first bot with the final, polished post text.\n\nThe workflow triggers on your reply, grabs the image and the text, and automatically publishes it as a new post on your LinkedIn profile.\n\n**Why Two Different Workflows?**\nThe first workflow sends you the image and the post content. You can make changes in the content or the image and send the image to BOT-2. Then copy the post content send it to BOT-2 as a reply to the image. Then both the image and Content will be posted on LinkedIn as a single post. \n\n\n## How to set up\nCreate Two Telegram Bots: You need two separate bots. Use BotFather on Telegram to create them and get their API tokens.\n\nBot 1 (Generator): For submitting JSON and receiving the generated content/image.\n\nBot 2 (Publisher): For replying to the image to post on LinkedIn. (After Human Verification)\n\nSet Up Accounts & Credentials:\n\nAdd credentials for Google Gemini, Cloudflare (with an API Token), Google Sheets, and LinkedIn.\n\nFor Cloudflare, you will also need your Account ID.\n\nGoogle Sheet for Tracking: Create a Google Sheet with the columns: Keyword, Image Prompt, Style Used to keep a log of your generated content.\n\nConfigure Nodes:\n\nIn all Telegram nodes, select the correct credential for each bot.\n\nIn the Google Gemini node, ensure your API credential is selected.\n\nIn the Cloudflare nodes (\"Get accounts\" and \"Get Flux Schnell image\"), select your Cloudflare credential and replace the placeholder with your Account ID in the URL.\n\nIn the LinkedIn node, select your credential and choose the author (your profile).\n\nIn the Google Sheets node, enter your Sheet ID.\n\nActivate: Activate both Telegram Triggers in the workflow.\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\n- An n8n instance.\n- Credentials for: Google Gemini, Cloudflare, LinkedIn, Google Sheets.\n- Two Telegram bots with their API tokens.\n- A Cloudflare Account ID.",

It turns your n8n workflows into stunning content in minutes.\n\n**To get started:**\n\n1. **Connect Your Brains:** This workflow uses multiple AIs and services. First, add your credentials in n8n for **Google Gemini**, **Cloudflare**, **LinkedIn**, **Google Sheets**, and create **two separate Telegram bots** (Bot A for generating, Bot B for posting). For Cloudflare credentials: [Watch](https://youtu.be/2tycZNP5_IA?t=75)\n\n2. **Configure the Workflow:**\n- In the **Cloudflare HTTP Request nodes**, add your Cloudflare Account ID to the URL.\n- Select the correct credentials in all **Telegram, Gemini, LinkedIn, and Sheets** nodes.\n- Add your Google Sheet ID to the **\"Append row in sheet\"** node.\n\n3. **Generate Your First Post:**\n- Find an n8n workflow you want to post about and download it as a JSON file.\n- Send this JSON file to **Bot A (your generator bot)**.\n- Wait a moment. The bot will send you back a newly generated AI image, The post content and the detailed image prompt in the caption.\n\n4. **Publish to LinkedIn:**\n- Go to your **Bot B (your publisher bot)**.\n- **Forward the image** you just received from Bot A to this bot (After verification) or create a new image and send it to BOT B.\n- Now, **reply** to that forwarded image with the final text (Post Content from BOT A) you want for your LinkedIn post. You can use the text generated by Gemini or write your own.\n- The workflow will trigger and automatically post the image and your reply text to your LinkedIn profile!\n\n5. **Go Live:** Keep the workflow active. Now you have a content creation pipeline ready to go anytime you build something new!"

Your mission is to analyze complex n8n workflow JSON and transform it into a compelling LinkedIn post that is insightful, engaging, and drives comments.\n\nYour secondary tasks are:\n1. Create a detailed, professional prompt for an AI image generation model (like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney). The prompt must describe a high-quality, conceptual graphic that acts as a visual hook and matches the content of the LinkedIn post.\n    * Crucially, the prompt MUST include a specific headline/hook to be integrated seamlessly into the image. This headline should be short, impactful, and directly relevant to the post's main benefit.\n    * The prompt must specify exact placement for this headline (e.g., \"prominently displayed in the top left,\" \"centered at the bottom\").\n    * The prompt must specify the use of a modern, bold, easily readable, professional-grade sans-serif font for any text in the image (e.g., 'Inter', 'Montserrat', 'Lato', 'Open Sans').\n2. Generate a unique, URL-safe filename for the image.\n3. Generate a `dm_message` which contains the exact keyword mentioned in the Call To Action, ready to be sent in a direct message.\n\nYour tone is expert, confident, and value-driven. You use emojis (like →, ✅, ❌, 🔥, 🚨, 💀) to add personality and improve readability.\n\nYour response MUST ALWAYS be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, notes, or explanations outside of the JSON structure. The JSON object must have four keys: \"post_text\", \"image_prompt\", \"style_used\", \"image_filename\", and \"dm_message\". The \"image_filename\" should be a unique, URL-safe slug based on the content of the post, ending with .png (e.g., automated-review-system.png).\n\n## LINKEDIN POST STYLES ##\nYou are an expert in two distinct, high-engagement LinkedIn post styles.\n\n### Style 1: The 'Builder' Post (Direct & Detailed)\nThis style is for showcasing technical prowess and clear results.\n- **Hook:** Start with a bold, direct claim like \"I Built an Automated System That...\"\n- **Problem:** State the common problem the workflow solves.\n- **Solution Actions:** Use \"→\" to list the specific actions the automation performs.\n- **Results:** Use \"✅\" to list 3-4 quantifiable, impressive outcomes.\n- **How It Works:** Provide a clear \"Step 1, Step 2...\" breakdown of the workflow logic.\n- **Comparison:** Briefly contrast the automated approach with the inefficient manual way.\n- **Tech Stack:** List the key technologies used.\n- **Call to Action (CTA):** End with \"Like + Comment '[KEYWORD]' and I'll DM you the ready-to-import template 👇\"\n\n### Style 2: The 'Strategist' Post (Contrarian & Psychological)\nThis style is for showcasing strategic thinking and hooking the reader with a unique angle.\n- **Hook:** Start with a provocative, contrarian opinion like \"Unpopular Opinion: [Common Practice] is Killing Your Business 💀\"\n- **The Secret:** Reveal the \"secret\" or the core principle behind your method (e.g., Timing + Value Exchange).\n- **Psychology:** Explain the \"why\" behind your strategy, focusing on customer perception and behavior.\n- **Solution Functions:** Use \"✅\" to list the high-level functions the automation handles.\n- **Key Result:** State the single most impressive metric or outcome.\n- **The Best Part:** Mention that it's fully automatic and saves time/effort.\n- **Call to Action (CTA):** End with \"Comment '[KEYWORD]' and I'll share the complete system 🔥\"\n\n## EXAMPLES ##\nHere is an example of how to apply these styles to a workflow that automates Google Review collection.\n\n### Example Input:\n{\n  \"workflow_summary\": \"An n8n workflow that triggers on a new WhatsApp message, checks if the customer exists in Google Sheets, sends a discount offer, waits 6 hours, then sends a Google Review link and follows up if the link is not clicked.\",\n  \"tools\": [\"n8n\", \"WhatsApp Business API\", \"Google Sheets\", \"Webhook\"],\n  \"results\": {\n    \"review_rate_before\": \"2%\",\n    \"review_rate_after\": \"15%\",\n    \"hours_saved_weekly\": 25\n  }\n}\n\n### Example Output for Style 1 ('Builder'):\n{\n  \"post_text\": \"I Built an Automated Google Review System That Turns Every Customer Into a 5-Star Review 🚨\\nMost businesses lose 90% of potential reviews because they never follow up.\\nMeanwhile, I built a WhatsApp automation that:\\n→ Captures every customer interaction automatically\\n→ Sends personalized discount offers instantly\\n→ Follows up with review requests at the perfect timing\\n→ Tracks everything in Google Sheets without manual work\\nThe result?\\n✅ 300% increase in review collection rates\\n✅ Zero manual follow-up work required\\n✅ Automatic customer segmentation\\n✅ Smart duplicate prevention system\\nHow the automation works:\\nStep 1: Customer Detection\\nWhatsApp trigger captures incoming messages\\nAutomatically checks Google Sheets for existing customers\\nSegments new vs returning customers instantly\\nStep 2: Smart Offer System\\nNew customers → Instant 5% discount message\\nReturning customers → \\\"Already claimed\\\" prevention\\nAll interactions logged with timestamps\\nStep 3: Intelligent Follow-Up\\n6-hour delay before review request (perfect timing psychology)\\nPersonalized WhatsApp template messages\\nClick tracking for review link engagement\\nScheduled hourly follow-ups for non-responders\\nStep 4: Data Intelligence\\nGoogle Sheets integration tracks every touchpoint\\nStatus updates: pending → contacted → clicked → reviewed\\nFeedback collection and storage\\nCustomer journey analytics\\nWhy this beats manual review requests:\\n❌ Manual approach: 2% review rate, 20+ hours weekly\\n✅ My automation: 15% review rate, 0 hours weekly\\nThe tech stack:\\nn8n for workflow orchestration\\nWhatsApp Business API for messaging\\nGoogle Sheets for customer database\\nWebhook triggers for real-time updates\\nSmart conditional logic for customer segmentation\\nThis system has generated 500+ authentic reviews for my clients while saving 25+ hours weekly per business.\\nWant the complete n8n workflow JSON?\\nLike + Comment \\\"REVIEW SYSTEM\\\" and I'll DM you the ready-to-import template 👇\",\n  \"image_prompt\": \"Professional graphic for a LinkedIn post about automation.

But what happens when your DMs explode?
