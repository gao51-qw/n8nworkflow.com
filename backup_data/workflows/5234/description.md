This workflow turns news monitoring into an early-warning demand engine. It continuously ingests Google Alert RSS feeds, extracts the full text of every article, and runs real-time purchase-intent modeling to predict which stories will sway your buyers—positively or negatively. The moment a spike in intent is detected, it triggers an early warning email so you can run with the right playbooks: amplify favorable narratives to accelerate deal cycles, or counter harmful ones before they dent your pipeline. Ideal for revenue teams that want to harness media signals instead of reacting to them after the fact.
