  "description": "## Overview: AI-Powered Interview Scheduling & Reminders\n\nThis workflow automates the end-to-end process of scheduling technical or behavioral interviews. It captures interview data via Webhook, creates a Google Calendar event with an integrated Google Meet link, generates a personalized, professional reminder email using AI (GPT-4.1-mini), and automatically sends it via Gmail exactly 24 hours before the interview.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nTo implement this workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Webhook:** Copy the Production URL and configure it in your Recrutei ATS to send interview JSON data.\n2. **Google Calendar:** Connect your account. The node is pre-configured to generate a \"hangoutsMeet\" conference link.\n3. **OpenAI:** Requires a valid API Key. The AI acts as a Recruitment Assistant to draft a professional email body.\n4. **Wait Node:** Currently set to \"1 day before\" the interview. You can adjust this timing based on your communication policy.\n5. **Gmail:** Connect your recruiter or company account to perform the final delivery.\n6. **Recrutei's API:** Inserts your Recrutei token in the Authorization header.",
