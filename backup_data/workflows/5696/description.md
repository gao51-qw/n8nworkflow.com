This n8n template automates the transformation of raw meeting notes into structured tasks and documents using GPT (or another model) , syncing them to Notion and TickTick via a Telegram bot.

## Use Cases
- Automate note-taking and formatting for daily standups, brainstorming sessions, or client calls.
- Reduce cognitive load by eliminating manual tracking of ideas and tedious formatting.
- Convert discussions into actionable tasks instantly with TickTick and structured notes in Notion.

## How It Works
- Capture Notes: Send raw meeting notes to a Telegram bot.
- AI Processing: The workflow sends the text to AI, which:
	- Removes duplicates and extracts key points.
	- Formats content into structured Markdown notes for Notion.
	- Identifies tasks with deadlines (e.g., "- Prepare presentation (Responsible: John, Deadline: Friday)").
- Task Parsing: Extracts task titles, removing metadata like "Responsible" and "Deadline."
- Review & Edit: The bot returns formatted notes and tasks for review in Telegram.
- Sync & Publish:
	- Notes are published to a Notion database.
	- Tasks are exported to TickTick via API.
- Confirmation: A Telegram reaction (e.g., 👌 emoji) confirms successful processing.

## Setup Instructions
1. Set Up Telegram Bot:
	1. Create a Telegram bot via BotFather and obtain an API token.
	2. Add the token to the "Telegram Trigger" and "Send-Edited-Notes" nodes under credentials (telegramApi).
2. Configure OpenAI:
	1. Obtain an OpenAI API key and add it to the "Edit-Notes" node (openAiApi credentials).
	2. Ensure the model is set to gpt-4.1-mini in the node parameters.
3. Set Up Notion:
	1. Create a Notion database for notes (e.g., "Meetings").
	2. Add the database ID to the "Create a Database Page" node (databaseId).
	3. Configure Notion API credentials (notionApi) in the node.
4. Set Up TickTick:
	1. Obtain a TickTick API key and add it to the "Create a Task" node (tickTickOAuth2Api credentials).
	2. Specify your TickTick project ID in the node (projectId).
5. Deploy Workflow:
	1. Ensure your n8n instance is self-hosted to support community nodes (TickTick, Notion).
	2. Activate the workflow in n8n.
6. Test:
	1. Send a test message to the Telegram bot (e.g., "Discussed project timeline. Tasks: - Prepare slides (Responsible: Alice, Deadline: Friday)").
	2. Verify that notes appear in Notion, tasks in TickTick, and a 👌 reaction in Telegram.

## Configuration Examples
#### Telegram Trigger:
```
{
  "parameters": {
    "updates": ["message"],
    "additionalFields": {}
  },
  "credentials": {
    "telegramApi": {
      "id": "your-telegram-api-id",
      "name": "meeting notes"
    }
  }
}
```
#### OpenAI Prompt (in "Edit-Notes" node):
```
Analyze the quick meeting notes from {{ $json.message.text }} 
Generate meeting notes and a task list in the following format:\nMeeting Notes:\n- [Note 1]\n- [Note 2]\n\nTasks:\n- [Task 1] \n- [Task 2] 
```
#### Notion Database Page
```
{
  "parameters": {
    "resource": "databasePage",
    "databaseId": "your-notion-database-id",
    "title": "MN {{ $now }}",
    "blockUi": {
      "blockValues": [
        {
          "textContent": "{{ $json.message.text }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Requirements
- Requires an OpenAI API key (or another model).
- APIs: Pre-configured Notion and TickTick API credentials are required. The template includes setup guides.
- Setup: Uses community nodes, requiring a self-hosted n8n instance.

## Customizing This Workflow
- Replace the Telegram bot with a webhook or form for alternative inputs (e.g., mobile apps).
- Modify the OpenAI prompt in the "Edit-Notes" node to customize note and task formats.
- Add filters in the "Split Notes and Tasks" node to prioritize tasks (e.g., ++#urgent++).
- Integrate Google Calendar via an additional HTTP Request node to auto-set deadlines based on text (e.g., "by Friday").
