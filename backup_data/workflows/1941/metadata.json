  "description": "This workflow sends a message to a Discord channel when a new row is added or a row is updated in a Google Sheet. The message will send all data rows in the Google Sheet.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Discord account and [Discord credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/discord/).\n- Google account and [Google credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/).\n\n## How it works\nUsing a code node, we can use the obtained Google Sheet data to create a custom message that will be sent to Discord. The message will be sent to the Discord channel specified in the Discord node.\n\n### Setup\nThis workflow requires that you set up a Discord webhook and have an existing Google Sheet with data. See [how to set up a Discord webhook here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/discord/#creating-a-webhook-in-discord).",
