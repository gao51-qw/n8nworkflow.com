  "description": "### 🧠 Intelligent AI Assistant with RAG & Voice for WhatsApp – Built with GPT-4o & Supabase\n\n---\n\n### 📌 About this workflow and its creator\n\nHi! I’m Amanda, a creator of intelligent automations using n8n and Make. I’ve been building AI-powered workflows for over 2 years, always focused on usability and innovation. This one here is very special to me – a truly advanced AI assistant that reads, listens, interprets and responds like a real human 🤖✨\n\nThis ready-to-use workflow acts as a powerful AI personal assistant capable of understanding messages via voice, text, documents, or even images. It supports full multi-channel operation (WhatsApp via Evolution API, Instagram, Facebook, and more), and includes advanced RAG capabilities using Supabase + GPT-4o. It’s designed to be highly extensible, with memory, prompt update tools, and knowledge base management.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ What this workflow does\n\n- 💬 Understands user input via text, document, audio or image (voice, OCR, PDF)\n- 🎤 Transcribes and interprets voice messages using OpenAI Whisper\n- 🧠 Understands prompts and user commands using GPT-4o via LangChain agent\n- 🗂️ Searches knowledge base using RAG + Supabase vector DB\n- 📄 Accepts documents and automatically indexes them for future questions\n- 🧾 Summarizes documents and stores metadata in Supabase\n- 🗃️ Offers memory support (PostgreSQL chat memory per user session)\n- 📧 Sends replies through WhatsApp (Evolution API), Instagram, Facebook, etc.\n- 📅 Manages schedules (via tool integration with Google Calendar)\n- 📬 Sends and searches emails (with support tools)\n- 🛠 Modular and expandable structure (tools for saving knowledge, deleting, updating prompt)\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Setup Instructions\n\n1. **n8n Hosting**  \n   This workflow **requires n8n self-hosted** (or n8n Cloud with custom credentials + community nodes enabled).\n\n2. **Create required databases**  \n   Use the provided SQL queries inside the `setar_supabase_tabelas_vectoriais`, `criar_cerebro`, and `criar_rag_controle` nodes to initialize:\n   - `documents` table for RAG\n   - `cerebro` table for prompt\n   - `memoria_chat` for session memory\n   - `rag_controle` for summaries and indexing\n\n3. **Credentials needed**\n   - OpenAI API (for chat, embeddings and Whisper transcription)\n   - Redis (for managing message buffer)\n   - Supabase (for vector store + metadata)\n   - Postgres (for memory and prompts)\n   - Evolution API (or other messaging platforms)\n\n4. **Webhook**\n   Set the webhook path to receive messages from your Evolution or WhatsApp API provider.\n\n5. **Configure ‘Set’ node**\n   In the `config` node, adjust:\n   - `adminNumero`: your personal WhatsApp or admin number\n   - `evolutionApiKey`: your private API key\n   - `utilizacaoApenasViaAdmin`: toggle if this should only respond to admin numbers\n\n6. **Tool connections**\n   Ensure the supporting workflows are also imported and connected for:\n   - Emails\n   - Knowledge management\n   - Calendar events\n\n---\n\n### 📎 Notes\n\n- This workflow uses LangChain agents, OpenAI GPT-4o, Supabase, Redis, and PostgreSQL.\n- It includes multiple “sticky notes” inside the workflow with explanations.\n- Ideal for businesses, consultants, and developers looking to offer an intelligent and extendable AI chatbot experience.\n\n---\n\n## 🛍 Want to use this on your system?\n❤️ Buy workflows: [https://iloveflows.com](https://iloveflows.com)  \n☁️ Use n8n Cloud with my partner link: [https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/amanda)",
