5. Update the instructions by filling in your name (or persona), response style, and add full email replies from the topic or individual you want the AI agent to emulate.

[Tip: Add actual replies from your email sent folder, including your greeting and sign off. Paste each email sample between a set of &lt;example&gt; .... &lt;/example&gt; tags]
