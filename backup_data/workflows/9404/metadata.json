  "description": "&gt; ⚠️ **Notice:**  \n&gt; Community nodes like **@custom-js/n8n-nodes-pdf-toolkit** can only be installed on self-hosted instances of n8n.  \n\n---\n\nThis n8n workflow demonstrates how to **collect form submissions from a landing page, fill a PDF form automatically, and send it via email**. It uses the **PDF Form Fill node from [customjs.space](https://www.customjs.space)** to populate PDF fields with the submitted data.  \n\n---\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n- Serves a **landing page** with a user-friendly form.  \n- Receives form submissions via a **Webhook**.  \n- Uses the **HTTP Request node** to fetch a PDF template.  \n- Fills the PDF form fields with the submitted data using the **PDF Form Fill node**.  \n- Optionally reads PDF form field names using **Get PDF Form Fields**.  \n- Sends the completed PDF as an **email attachment**.  \n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Self-hosted n8n instance.  \n- CustomJS API key for the PDF Toolkit nodes.  \n- SMTP account for sending emails.  \n- Optional: Access to the PDF template online.  \n\n---\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n1. **Landingpage Endpoint (Webhook)**  \n   Serves the landing page HTML to visitors.  \n\n2. **Set Form Endpoint**  \n   Dynamically injects the endpoint URL into the HTML form.  \n\n3. **HTML for Landingpage**  \n   Provides the form where users enter personal information (name, address, city, country, etc.).  \n\n4. **Respond to Webhook**  \n   Returns the landing page HTML to the visitor.  \n\n5. **FormData Endpoint (Webhook)**  \n   Receives the submitted form data as JSON.  \n\n6. **HTTP Request – Get PDF Template**  \n   Fetches the PDF form template from a URL.  \n\n7. **PDF Form Fill (Fill PDF Fields)**  \n   Populates the PDF with the submitted form data.  \n\n8. **Get PDF Form Fields (Optional)**  \n   Reads and lists the names of the form fields in the PDF.  \n\n9. **Send Email**  \n   Sends the completed PDF as an attachment to a configured recipient.  \n\n10. **Sticky Notes**  \n    Provide documentation within the workflow for easier understanding and maintenance.  \n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n1. **Get API key from CustomJS**  \n   - Sign up on the [CustomJS platform](https://www.customjs.space).  \n   - Navigate to your profile page and copy your API key.  \n\n2. **Set Credentials for CustomJS API in n8n**  \n   - Create a new credential in n8n with your API key.  \n\n3. **Prepare SMTP Credentials**  \n   - Add your SMTP server credentials to n8n for sending emails.  \n\n4. **Run or schedule the workflow**  \n   - The workflow will serve the landing page, fill the PDF form with submissions, and send it via email.  \n\n---\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n- **Modify the landing page form** in the HTML node to add or remove fields.  \n- **Change PDF template URL** in the HTTP Request node.  \n- **Add more recipients** or dynamic email addresses in the Send Email node.  \n- **Track submitted form data** in Google Sheets or a database for long-term storage.  \n- **Extend workflow logic** with validation or notifications using additional nodes.\n",
