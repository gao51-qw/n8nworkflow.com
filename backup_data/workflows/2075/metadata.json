  "title": "Nightly n8n backup to Dropbox",
  "description": "This template will create a nightly backup of all your n8n workflows to a Dropbox folder. Each night, the previous night's backups are moved into an \"old\" folder, and renamed with the date they were taken.\n\nBackups over a specified age are deleted. (this is disabled by default for safety until you manually enable and verify it with your own setup)\n\nPrerequisites\n- Dropbox account and credentials\n- A destination folder for backups\n\nSetup\n- Update all dropbox nodes with your credential\n- Edit the **Schedule Trigger** node with the desired time to run the backup\n- Edit the **DESTINATION FOLDER** node to specify the path in dropbox to upload to. This should be a folder and *include* the trailing /\n- If you want to automatically purge old backups\n\t- Edit the **PURGE DAYS** node to specify the age to purge\n\t- Enable the **PURGE DAYS** node, and the 3 subsequent nodes\n- Enable the workflow to run on the specified schedule\n\n",
