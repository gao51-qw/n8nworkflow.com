This is an example that gets the logo, icon, and information of a company and stores it in Airtbale. 

You can set the values that you want to store in the Set node. If you want to store the data in a different database (Google Sheet, Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) replace the Airtable node with that node.

You can refer to the documentation to learn how to build this workflow from scratch.
