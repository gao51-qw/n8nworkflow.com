  "description": "**Overview**\n\nThis workflow turns photos sent to a LINE bot into tiny AI-generated diary entries and saves everything neatly in Google Drive. Each time a user sends an image, the workflow creates a timestamped photo file and a matching text file with a short diary sentence, stored inside a year/month folder structure (KidsDiary/YYYY/MM). It’s a simple way to keep a lightweight visual diary for kids or daily life without manual typing. \n\nLINE Photo to AI Diary with Goo…\n\n**Who this is for**\n\nParents who want to archive kids’ photos with a short daily comment\n\nPeople who often send photos to LINE and want them auto-organized in Drive\n\nAnyone who prefers a low-friction, “take a photo and forget” style diary\n\n**How it works**\n\nTrigger: A LINE Webhook receives an image message from the user.\n\nExtract metadata: The workflow extracts the messageId and replyToken.\n\nDownload image: It calls the LINE content API to fetch the image as binary.\n\nAI diary text: OpenAI Vision generates a one-sentence, diary-style caption (about 50 Japanese characters).\n\nFolder structure: A KidsDiary/YYYY/MM folder is created (or reused) in Google Drive.\n\nSave files: The photo is saved as YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss.jpg and the diary text as YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss_diary.txt in the same folder.\n\nConfirm on LINE: The bot replies to the user that the photo and diary have been saved.\n\n**How to set up**\n\nConnect your LINE Messaging API credentials in the HTTP Request nodes.\n\nConnect your Google Drive credential in the Google Drive nodes and choose a root folder.\n\nMake sure the webhook URL is correctly registered in the LINE Developers console.\n\n**Customization ideas**\n\nChange the AI prompt to adjust tone (e.g., more playful, more sentimental).\n\nLocalize the diary language or add an English translation.\n\nAdd a second branch to post the saved diary entry to Slack, Notion, or email.\n\nOrganize Google Drive folders by child’s name instead of only by date.",
