# Generate & publish professional video ads with Veo 3, Gemini & Creatomate

> # Professional AI-Powered Ad Generator

Creating high-quality video ads has traditionally been one of the biggest challenges for small businesses and marketers. It usually requires a production team, editing software, and days of effort before anything is ready to publish. That makes consistency almost impossible — especially if you want to publish new ads every day.

This workflow changes the process entirely. Built in **n8n**, the **Professional AI-Powered Ad Generator** combines **AI and automation** to handle everything from script creation to video rendering and social media publishing. The goal is simple: allow you to create and distribute short, engaging video ads in minutes, without relying on a studio, editors, or complicated tools.

## Why This Workflow Matters

Most businesses know the importance of consistent advertising, but producing daily video content has always felt out of reach. This workflow makes it practical by:

- **Automating creative tasks** that normally require a writer or video editor.  
- **Integrating multiple AI tools** into one connected system.  
- **Publishing directly to social media** so your ads reach people without extra steps.

Instead of spending hours editing or outsourcing to agencies, you can now go from idea to published ad in the same amount of time it takes to write a short post.

## How It Works

The process starts with a simple form where you enter your business details: name, service, offer, and call-to-action. From there, the workflow runs automatically:

### 1. Script Planning  
AI generates a short, two-part script that feels natural and relatable.  
- Part one introduces a **problem**.  
- Part two presents your **business as the solution**, ending with a strong CTA.

### 2. Video Generation with **Google Veo 3**  
Each part of the script is turned into an **8-second cinematic video clip**, visually optimized for vertical platforms.

### 3. Character Consistency with **Google Gemini**  
Characters are analyzed and matched across both clips, creating a smooth narrative with **visual continuity**.

### 4. Assembly with **Creatomate**  
Both clips are merged into a **16-second vertical ad**, automatically formatted for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts.

### 5. Automated Publishing with **Postiz**  
The final video is scheduled and posted to your connected social accounts.  
- **Captions and titles** are generated automatically.  
- No manual uploads or extra steps.
