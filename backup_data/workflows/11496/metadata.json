  "description": "##  🎬 Rask AI Video Translation Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed to **translate a video accessible by URL** (supported sources: YouTube, Google Drive, S3, Vimeo, or a direct link) into [a language supported by Rask AI](https://docs.api.rask.ai/languages/destination).  \n\nIt automatically uploads your video, waits for it to finish processing, creates a translation project, and retrieves the final translated output.\n\nYou can use it to quickly build automations for localization, multilingual content creation, training materials, and more.\n\n###  🔐 Authentication\n\nTo run this workflow, make sure you have **OAuth2 authentication** configured in n8n under the name **`raskOAuth2`**.\n\nYour OAuth2 credentials must include **Client ID**  and **Client Secret**\n\nYou can find both in your Rask account settings:  \n👉 https://app.rask.ai/account\n\nFor details on Rask authentication, refer to the official documentation:  \n👉 https://docs.api.rask.ai/api-reference/authentication\n\nEnsure that the **`raskOAuth2`** authentication is selected in the following nodes: **Upload media**,  **Get media**, **Create project**, **Get project**\n\nThese nodes interact with the Rask API and require valid credentials.\n\n###  🧪 Test Input\n\nYou can test the workflow using the following sample values (simply insert these values into your trigger or input node to run a full translation cycle end-to-end.):\n\n- **`link`**:  \n  `https://static.rask.ai/samples/sample_1.mp4`\n\n- **`dst_lang`** (target translation language):  \n  `en-us`\n--- \n\nHappy Translating! 🌍✨",
