# ⚙️ Advanced Equipment Health Monitor with MS Teams Integration (n8n | API | Google Sheets | MSTeams)

This n8n workflow automatically monitors equipment health by fetching real-time metrics like temperature, voltage and operational status. If any of these parameters cross critical thresholds, an alert is instantly sent to a Microsoft Teams channel and the event is logged in Google Sheets. The workflow runs every 15 minutes by default.

## ⚡ Quick Implementation Steps

1. **Import the workflow JSON** into your n8n instance.
2. **Open the "Set Config" node** and update:
   - API endpoint
   - Teams webhook URL
   - Threshold values
   - Google Sheet ID
3. **Activate the workflow** to start receiving alerts every 15 minutes.

## 🎯 Who’s It For

- Renewable energy site operators (solar, wind)
- Plant maintenance and operations teams
- Remote infrastructure monitoring services
- IoT-integrated energy platforms
- Enterprise environments using Microsoft Teams

## 🛠 Requirements

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| n8n Instance | To run and schedule automation |
| HTTP API | Access to your equipment or IoT platform health API |
| Microsoft Teams | Incoming Webhook URL configured |
| Google Sheets | Logging and analytics |
| SMTP (optional) | For email-based alternatives or expansions |

## 🧠 What It Does

- **Runs every 15 minutes** to check the latest equipment metrics.
- **Compares values** (temperature, voltage, status) against configured thresholds.
- **Triggers a Microsoft Teams message** when a threshold is breached.
- **Appends the alert data** to a Google Sheet for logging and review.

## 🧩 Workflow Components

- **Set Node:** Configures thresholds, endpoints, webhook URL and Sheet ID.
- **Cron Node:** Triggers the check every 15 minutes.
- **HTTP Request Node:** Pulls data from your equipment health monitoring API.
- **IF Node:** Evaluates if conditions are within or outside defined limits.
- **MS Teams Alert Node:** Sends structured alerts using a Teams incoming webhook.
- **Google Sheets Node:** Logs alert details for recordkeeping and analytics.

## 🔧 How To Set Up – Step-by-Step

1. **Import Workflow:**
   - In n8n, click **Import** and upload the provided `.json` file.

2. **Update Configurations:**
   - Open the **Set Config** node.
   - Replace the placeholder values:
     - `apiEndpoint`: URL to fetch equipment data.
     - `teamsWebhookUrl`: Your MS Teams channel webhook.
     - `temperatureThreshold`: Example = 80
     - `voltageThreshold`: Example = 400
     - `googleSheetId`: Google Sheet ID (must be shared with n8n service account).

3. **Check Webhook Integration:**
   - Ensure your MS Teams webhook is properly authorized and points to a live channel.

4. **Run & Monitor:**
   - Enable the workflow and view logs/alerts.
   - Adjust thresholds as needed.

## 🧪 How To Customize

| Customization | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Add more parameters (humidity, pressure) | Extend the HTTP + IF node conditions |
| Change alert frequency | Edit the Cron node |
| Use Slack or Email instead of Teams | Replace MS Teams node with Slack or Email node |
| Add PDF Report Generation | Use HTML → PDF node and email the report |
| Export to Database | Add a PostgreSQL or MySQL node instead of Google Sheets |

## ➕ Add‑ons (Advanced)

| Add-on | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📦 Auto-Ticketing | Auto-create issues in Jira, Trello or ClickUp for serious faults |
| 📊 Dashboard Sync | Send real-time logs to BigQuery or InfluxDB |
| 🧠 Predictive Alerts | Use machine learning APIs to flag anomalies |
| 🗂 Daily Digest | Compile all incidents into a daily summary email or Teams post |
| 📱 Mobile Alert | Integrate Twilio for SMS alerts or WhatsApp notifications |

## 📈 Example Use Cases

1. Monitor solar inverter health for overheating or voltage drops.
2. Alert field engineers via Teams when a wind turbine sensor fails.
3. Log and visualize hardware issues for weekly analytics.
4. Automate SLA compliance tracking through timely notifications.
5. Ensure distributed infrastructure (e.g., substations) are always in operational range.

## 🧯 Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| No Teams alert | Incorrect webhook URL or formatting | Recheck the Teams webhook and payload |
| Workflow not triggering | Cron node misconfigured | Ensure it’s set to run every 15 mins and workflow is active |
| Google Sheet not updating | Sheet ID is wrong or not shared | Share Sheet with your n8n Google service account |
| No data from API | Endpoint URL is down or wrong | Test the endpoint manually with Postman or browser |
