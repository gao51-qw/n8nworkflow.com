### Who is this for?
- Teams using Gmail and Slack who want to streamline email handling.
- Customer support, sales, and operations teams that want emails sorted by topic and priority automatically.
- Anyone tired of manually triaging customer emails.

### What does it solve?
- Stops important messages from slipping through the cracks.
- Automatically identifies the nature and urgency of incoming emails.
- Routes emails to the right Slack channel with a clear, AI-generated summary.

### How it works
- The workflow watches for unread emails in your Gmail inbox.
- It fetches the full email content and passes it to OpenAI for classification.
- The AI returns structured JSON with the email’s category, priority, summary, and sender.
- Based on the AI result, it assigns a label and Slack channel.
- A message is sent to the right Slack channel with the details.

### How to setup?
1. **Connect credentials:**
   - Gmail (OAuth2)
   - Slack (OAuth2)
   - OpenAI (API Key)

2. **Adjust email polling:**
   - Open the Gmail Trigger node and set how frequently it should check for new emails.

3. **Verify routing settings:**
   - In the “Routing Map” node, update Slack channel IDs for each category if needed.

4. **Customize AI behavior (optional):**
   - Tweak the AI Agent prompt to better match your internal categorization rules.

### How to customize this workflow to your needs
- **Add more categories:** Update the AI prompt and the schema in the “Structured Output Parser.”
- **Change Slack formatting:** Modify the message text in the Slack node to include links, emojis, or mentions.
- **Use different routing logic:** Expand the Routing Map to assign based on keywords, domains, or even sentiment.
- **Add escalation workflows:** Trigger follow-up actions for high-priority or complaint emails.
