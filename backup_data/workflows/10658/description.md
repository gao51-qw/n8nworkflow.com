#  What It Does

Build your own AI Chatbot that listens, thinks, searches, and speaks — all inside n8n.
This template combines Groq AI, LangChain Agent, SerpAPI, and StreamElements TTS to create a chatbot that:

- Understands natural language input
- Searches the web for real-time answers
- Remembers previous messages (context memory)
- Replies with a realistic AI voice

# How It Works

- Chat Trigger: The workflow activates whenever a new message is received.
- Groq AI Agent: Processes user input, performs reasoning, and integrates with SerpAPI for live web results.
- Memory Node: Keeps the chat context for a natural conversation flow.
- TTS Node: Converts AI responses into realistic voice replies using StreamElements API.

# Setup Steps

- Connect your Groq, SerpAPI, and StreamElements credentials (no coding required).
- Customize the chatbot behavior directly inside n8n.
- Deploy instantly and chat via webhook or UI widget.

# Use Cases

- Voice-enabled customer-support bots
- AI chat widgets for websites
- Personal assistants that talk and search the web
