  "description": "## Adobe developer API\n\nDid you know that Adobe provides an API to perform all sort of manipulation on PDF files : \n\n- Split PDF, Combine PDF\n- OCR\n- Insert page, delete page, replace page, reorder page\n- Content extraction (text content, tables, pictures)\n- ...\n\nThe free tier allows up to 500 PDF operation / month. As it comes directly from Adobe, it works often better than other alternatives.\n\nAdobe documentation: \n\n- [https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/howtos/](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/howtos/)\n- [https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/gettingstarted/](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/gettingstarted/)\n\n## What does this workflow do\n\nThe API is a bit painful to use. To perform a transformation on a PDF it requires to \n\n- Authenticate and get a temporal token\n- Register a new asset (file)\n- Upload you PDF to the registered asset\n- Perform a query according to the transformation requested\n- Wait for the query to be proccessed by Adobe backend\n- Download the result\n\nThis workflow is a generic wrapper to perform all these steps for any transformation endpoint. I usually use it from other workflow with an `Execute Workflow` node.\n\nExamples are given in the workflow.\n\n## Example use case\n\nThis service is useful for example to **clean PDF data for an AI / RAG system**. \n\nMy favorite use-case is to extract table as images and forward images to an AI for image recognition / description which is often more accuarate than feedind raw tabular data to a LLM.",
