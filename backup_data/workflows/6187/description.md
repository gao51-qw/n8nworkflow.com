# 📸 Instagram Full Profile Scraper with Apify and Google Sheets

This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping full Instagram profiles using a [custom Apify actor](https://apify.com/mohamedgb00714/instagram-full-profile-scraper), and logs the results into a Google Sheet. It is designed to run at scheduled intervals and process a list of usernames by calling the API, appending the results, and marking them as processed.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ⏱ **Scheduled Execution** – Runs automatically every few minutes.
* 📄 **Google Sheets Integration** – Reads a list of Instagram usernames and updates the same sheet.
* 🧠 **Apify Actor** – Fetches full public Instagram profile data.
* 🧮 **Aggregation** – Batches usernames for bulk scraping.
* ✍️ **Data Logging** – Appends scraped data to a second sheet.
* ✅ **Tracking** – Marks usernames as processed once scraped.
