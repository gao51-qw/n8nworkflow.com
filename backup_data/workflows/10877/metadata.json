  "description": "## Instantly Track Reddit Discussions and Generate Insights\n\nManually monitoring Reddit for relevant discussions can be overwhelming. This automation does all the heavy lifting by automatically searching for **keywords across selected subreddits or the entire Reddit**, analyzing each post with **GPT-5-Mini**, and saving structured insights in your **Notion database**. Optionally, receive daily email notifications summarizing new discussions without lifting a finger.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Features**\n\n* **Daily Automated Reddit Monitoring**  \n  Checks Reddit once a day for new posts matching your keywords in selected subreddits or across all of Reddit.\n\n* **AI-Powered Analysis with Custom Prompts**  \n  Uses GPT-5-Mini to:  \n  - Assign a **relevance score** to each post based on your defined priorities.  \n  - Generate a **suggested comment** tailored to your audience or engagement strategy.  \n  - Allow custom prompts so you can tweak AI behavior for lead generation, competitor monitoring, or brand mentions.\n\n* **Notion Integration**  \n  Saves all posts, relevance scores, and AI-generated comments directly into your Notion database for easy tracking and collaboration.  \n  ![Notion ScreenShot](https://res.cloudinary.com/datbbikfe/image/upload/v1763283388/n8n/Screenshot_2025-11-16_at_1.23.50_PM_brfh94.png)\n\n* **Optional Email Alerts**  \n  Sends a clean, HTML-formatted email summarizing new discussions and insights.  \n  ![Email Screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/datbbikfe/image/upload/v1763283525/n8n/Screenshot_2025-11-16_at_1.21.31_PM_bdnc5g.png)\n\n* **No API Keys Required for Reddit**  \n  Works with the official Reddit API without requiring users to create credentials.\n\n* **Customizable Inputs**  \n  Users define keywords, subreddits, relevance criteria, custom prompts, and notification preferences with minimal setup.\n\n---\n\n## **Setup Instructions**\n\n### 1. Configure Keywords and Subreddits\n\n1. Open the **Define Keywords and Subreddits** node.  \n2. Enter your target keywords and choose specific subreddits, or enable search across all Reddit.  \n3. Map the inputs to the workflow’s search nodes.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Connect OpenAI (GPT-5-Mini)\n\n1. Create an OpenAI account and obtain your **API key**.  \n2. Open the **AI Analysis Node** in the workflow.  \n3. Paste your OpenAI API key into the credentials field.  \n4. Customize your prompts to define how GPT-5-Mini:  \n   - Scores relevance based on your specific criteria.  \n   - Generates suggested comments tailored to your objectives (e.g., lead generation, brand engagement, competitor analysis).  \n5. Test the node to ensure relevance scoring and suggested comments are generated correctly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Connect Notion\n\n1. Duplicate the provided Notion template into your workspace.  \n2. Obtain your **Notion integration secret** from Notion settings.  \n3. Paste the secret into the **Add Each Post to Notion Database** node.  \n4. Test the connection to ensure posts are saved correctly.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Optional Email Notifications\n\n1. Setup **Google API credentials** in the Google Cloud Console.  \n2. Authenticate Gmail in the workflow.  \n3. Map the recipient email and customize the notification format.  \n4. Test sending an email to confirm delivery.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Configure Workflow Trigger\n\n1. Import the workflow into n8n.  \n2. Ensure the daily trigger is enabled.  \n3. Optionally adjust schedule or notification settings.\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n1. **Daily Trigger:** Starts the workflow once per day.  \n2. **Reddit Search:** Queries new posts based on user-defined keywords.  \n3. **AI Analysis:** GPT-5-Mini evaluates **relevance score** and generates **suggested comments** based on your custom prompts.  \n4. **Save & Notify:** Posts are saved to Notion and optionally summarized via email.\n\n---\n\n## **Example Use Cases**\n\n* Generate **leads** by identifying potential prospects discussing your industry or product.  \n* Monitor **brand mentions** to stay on top of conversations around your company.  \n* Track **competitor activity** across relevant subreddits.  \n* Keep a daily digest of trending posts for **market research or content ideas**.  \n* Automate engagement by posting AI-generated **suggested comments**.\n\n---\n\n## **Requirements**\n\n| Tool           | Purpose                                           |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| Notion Account | Store posts, relevance scores, and comments      |\n| Gmail Account  | Optional daily email notifications               |\n| n8n            | Run, schedule, and manage the workflow           |\n| OpenAI API Key | Access GPT-5-Mini for relevance scoring and AI-generated comments |\n\n---\n",
