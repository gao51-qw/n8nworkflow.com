## 📱🤖 Create Stunning AI Images Directly from WhatsApp with Gemini

This workflow transforms your WhatsApp into a personal AI image generation studio. Simply send a text message with your idea, and this bot will use the advanced prompt engineering capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro to craft a detailed, artistic prompt. It then uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate a high-quality image from that prompt and sends it right back to your chat.

It's a powerful yet simple way to bring your creative ideas to life, all from the convenience of your favorite messaging app\!

### What this workflow does

  - **Listens for WhatsApp Messages**: The workflow starts automatically when you send a message to your connected WhatsApp number.
  - **Enhances Your Idea with AI**: It takes your basic text (e.g., "a knight on a horse") and uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to expand it into a rich, detailed prompt perfect for image generation (e.g., "A cinematic, full-body shot of a stoic knight in gleaming, ornate silver armor, riding a powerful black warhorse through a misty, ancient forest. The scene is lit by ethereal morning sunbeams piercing the canopy, creating dramatic volumetric lighting and long shadows. Photorealistic, 8K, ultra-detailed, award-winning fantasy concept art.").
  - **Generates a Unique Image**: It sends this enhanced prompt to the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash image generation API.
  - **Prepares the Image**: The API returns the image in Base64 format, and the workflow instantly converts it into a binary file.
  - **Sends it Back to You**: The final, high-quality image is sent directly back to you in the same WhatsApp chat.

### Nodes Used

  - **🟢 WhatsApp Trigger**: The entry point that listens for incoming messages.
  - **🧠 LangChain Chain (LLM)**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for advanced prompt engineering.
  - **➡️ HTTP Request**: Calls the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate the image.
