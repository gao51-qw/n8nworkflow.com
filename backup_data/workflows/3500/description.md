### Context
I’m a [**Supply Chain Data Scientist**](https://samirsaci.com) and content creator who writes regularly about **data-driven optimization, logistics, and sustainability**. Promoting blog articles on LinkedIn used to be a manual task — until I decided to **automate it with N8N and GPT-4o**.

This workflow lets you **automatically extract blog posts**, clean the content, and generate a **professional LinkedIn post** using an **AI Agent powered by GPT-4o** — all in one seamless automation.

&gt;Save hours of repetitive work and boost your reach with AI.
