#   AI Product Catalog Chatbot with Google Drive Ingestion & Supabase RAG

##  Overview
This workflow builds a **dual-system** that connects **automated document ingestion** with a **live product catalog chatbot** powered by **Mistral AI** and **Supabase**.

It includes:
- **Ingestion Pipeline:** Automatically fetches JSON files from Google Drive, processes their content, and stores vector embeddings in Supabase.  
- **Chatbot:** An AI agent that queries the Supabase vector store (RAG) to answer user questions about the product catalog.  

It uses **Mistral AI** for chat intelligence and embeddings, and **Supabase** for vector storage and semantic product search.

##  Chatbot Flow
- **Trigger:** `When chat message received` or `Webhook` (from live website)
- **Model:** `Mistral Cloud Chat Model (mistral-medium-latest)`
- **Memory:** `Simple Memory (Buffer Window)` — keeps last 15 messages for conversational context
- **Vector Search Tool:** `Supabase Vector Store`
- **Embeddings:** `Mistral Cloud`
- **Agent:** `product catalog agent`
  - Responds to user queries using the `products` table in Supabase.  
  - Searches vectors for relevant items and returns structured product details (name, specs, images, and links).  
  - Maintains chat session history for natural follow-up questions.

##  Document → Knowledge Base Pipeline
Triggered manually (`Execute workflow`) to populate or refresh the Supabase vector store.

### Steps
1. **Google Drive (List Files)**  
   → Fetch all files from the configured Google Drive folder.

2. **Loop Over Items**  
   → For each file:
   - **Google Drive (Get File)**  
     → Download the JSON document.
   - **Extract from File**  
     → Parse and read raw JSON content.
   - **Map Data into Fields (`Set` node)**  
     → Clean and normalize JSON keys (e.g., `page_title`, `comprehensive_summary`, `key_topics`).
   - **Convert Data into Chunks (`Code` node)**  
     → Merge text fields like `summary` and `markdown`.  
     → Split content into overlapping 2,000-character chunks.  
     → Add metadata such as `title`, `URL`, and `chunk index`.
   - **Embeddings (Mistral Cloud)**  
     → Generate vector embeddings for each text chunk.
   - **Insert into Supabase Vectorstore**  
     → Save chunks + embeddings into the `website_mark` table.
   - **Wait**  
     → Pause for 30 seconds before the next file to respect rate limits.
