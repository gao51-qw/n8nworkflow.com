### How it Works

1.  **Receive Request:** The workflow listens for incoming voice or text messages on Telegram containing your content request.
2.  **Process Voice (if necessary):** If the message is a voice message, it's transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper API.
3.  **AI Takes Over:** The AI agent, powered by an OpenAI Chat Model and SerpAPI, conducts online research based on your request.
4.  **Content and Image Prompt Generation:** The AI agent generates engaging social media content and a detailed image prompt based on the research.
5.  **Image Generation (Optional):** You can use the generated image prompt with your preferred AI art generation tool (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) to create a visual.
6.  **Output:** The workflow provides you with the social media content and the detailed image prompt, ready for you to use or refine.
