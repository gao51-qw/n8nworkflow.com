# 📄 Convert Parquet, Feather, ORC & Avro Files with ParquetReader

This workflow allows you to upload and inspect Parquet, Feather, ORC, or Avro files via the [ParquetReader API](https://parquetreader.com). It instantly returns a structured **JSON preview** of your data — including rows, schema, and metadata — without needing to write any custom code.

---

## ✅ Perfect For
- Validating schema and structure before syncing or transformation
- Previewing raw columnar files on the fly
- Automating QA, ETL, or CI/CD workflows
- Converting Parquet, Avro, Feather, or ORC to JSON

---

## ⚙️ Use Cases
- Catch schema mismatches before pipeline runs
- Automate column audits in incoming data files
- Enrich metadata catalogs with real-time schema detection
- Integrate file validation into automated workflows

## 🚀 How to Use This Workflow

#### 📥 Trigger via File Upload

You can trigger this flow by sending a `POST` request with a file using **curl**, **Postman**, or **from another n8n flow**.

#### 🔧 Example (via `curl`):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/convert \
-F "file=@converted.parquet"
```
&gt; Replace `converted.parquet` with your local file path. You can also send Avro, ORC or Feather files.

#### 🔁 Reuse from Other Flows
You can **reuse this flow** by calling the webhook from another n8n workflow using an **HTTP Request** node.  
Make sure to send the file as **form-data** with the field name `file`.

#### 🔍 What This Flow Does:
- Receives the uploaded file via webhook (`file`)
- Sends it to `https://api.parquetreader.com/parquet` as `multipart/form-data` (field name: `file`)
- Receives parsed data (rows), schema, and metadata in JSON format
