# Get qualified leads in one click from Apollo to Airtable

> ## You Don’t Need More Tools. You Just Need the Right Leads.
Why spend $1,000s on lead gen when your perfect leads are already waiting in Apollo? You’ve already filtered the ideal prospects. You know who they are, where they work, and what they do.

Now **imagine turning that list into enriched, ready-to-contact leads—without paying pricey Apollo's recurring subscription** *(spoiler: you will pay only 0.60$ per 500 leads)*.

## From Filter to Outreach-Ready in Seconds
With the Lead Generation System, you just drop your Apollo search URL.

**The workflow does the rest:**
✅ Scrapes all matching contacts from your Apollo filter
✅ Enriches and organizes the data (names, roles, emails, LinkedIns, companies, etc.)
✅ Delivers the final lead list to Airtable—or your CRM of choice

No more manual exports. 
No CSV mess. 
No VA needed.
Just qualified leads, cleaned and ready to go.

## Perfect For
- Founders doing DIY outbound
- Growth marketers scaling cold email
- Agencies running lead-gen for clients
- Anyone tired of paying too much for messy, outdated lists
