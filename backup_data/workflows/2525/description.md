## **How It Works**
1. **Collect Inputs**: Users fill out a form with details like article title, keywords, and instructions.
2. **Generate Content**: AI creates an outline and writes the article based on user inputs.
3. **Organize Files**: Saves the outline and final article in Google Drive for easy access.
4. **Track Progress**: Updates Google Sheets with links to the generated content for tracking.
