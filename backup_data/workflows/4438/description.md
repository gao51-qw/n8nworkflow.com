This workflow demonstrates how to fetch data specifically from **Goodreads** web pages using Bright Data and then extract specific information (quotes) from that data using a Google Gemini AI model.

## How it works

*   The workflow is triggered manually.
*   It sends a request to a Bright Data collector to scrape data from a predefined list of **Goodreads** URLs.
*   The collected text data from **Goodreads** is then passed to a Google Gemini AI node.
*   The AI node processes the text and extracts quotes based on a specified JSON schema output format.

## Set up steps

Setting up this workflow should take only a few minutes.

*   You will need a Bright Data API key to configure the 'Header Auth' credential.
*   You will need a Google Gemini API key to configure the 'Google Gemini(PaLM) Api account' credential.
*   Ensure the correct Bright Data collector ID is set in the 'Perform Bright Data Web Request' node URL.
*   Make sure the full list of target **Goodreads** URLs is correctly added to the 'Perform Bright Data Web Request' node's body.
*   Link your created credentials to the respective nodes ('Perform Bright Data Web Request' and 'Quotes Extractor').
*   Keep detailed descriptions for specific node configurations in sticky notes inside your workflow canvas.
