The **AI Calling Agent** is a fully automated phone assistant built with **n8n, GoHighLevel (GHL), VAPI, and Twilio**.  
This workflow allows you to:  
- Trigger outbound calls from your CRM (GHL).  
- Use a voice AI assistant (VAPI) to talk with leads in real time.  
- Route calls through Twilio.  
- Save **appointments and full conversation summaries** directly in GHL.  

It has been tested on **real warm leads** (not random numbers) and proven stable at **up to 300 calls/day without interruption**.  
Instead of manually calling and qualifying each lead, let the agent do it automatically and focus only on booked calls.

## Workflow in Action  

#### Appointment booking  
- The agent can confirm appointments and save them directly in your GHL calendar, along with the summary of the conversation.

#### Agent performance  
- You can monitor conversations, call logs, and outcomes directly in the VAPI dashboard.

#### Agent working live  
- Proof that the agent can run **non-stop for hundreds of calls per day** without errors or interruptions.  
- Demonstrates reliability and stability even under continuous execution.

#### Contact statuses  
- Each contact in GHL receives a status tag depending on the call result: **answered**, **invalid number**, **no response**, etc. This ensures your pipeline stays clean and updated automatically.

#### The brain of the agent  
- Inside VAPI, every assistant is powered by a **command system (the brain)** where you define how it should behave during calls.  
- In this case, the brain is **propelled by OpenAI**, but VAPI also supports a wide range of AI models such as **Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, LLaMA** and more.  
- The same flexibility applies to voices: you can instantly switch between integrated providers like **ElevenLabs, Play.ht, Microsoft Azure Voices, Google Cloud TTS**, and others.  
- This makes the agent not only smart but also highly customizable - from the intelligence driving the conversation to the exact voice your clients will hear.
