  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates how to leverage AI to analyze trending short-form video content and automatically generate original, high-engagement video scripts inspired by proven viral formats.\n\nUse cases are many: Create consistent content calendars for beauty salons and aestheticians, maintain a steady stream of reels without creative burnout, or study viral patterns to understand what drives engagement across Instagram's trending hashtags!\n\n## Good to know\n\n* The workflow scrapes real trending reels from Instagram based on your chosen hashtag, ensuring you're always learning from current viral patterns\n* Video transcription happens automatically, extracting the core messaging and pacing strategies from successful content\n* Generated scripts use proven engagement structures—hook, value delivery, and call-to-action timing—without copying original content\n* All data is organized in Google Sheets for easy review, editing, and tracking of script performance\n* The AI model intelligently mirrors the emotional tone and narrative structure while creating entirely new storylines\n\n## How it works\n\n* A form trigger collects your hashtag and desired number of reels to analyze\n* The Apify API scrapes trending Instagram reels matching your hashtag, filtering for high engagement (1000+ likes from the last 7 days)\n* Filtered reels are added to your Google Sheet with metadata: captions, engagement metrics, video links, and music information\n* Each reel is automatically transcribed using video-to-text technology, capturing the exact dialogue and timing\n* The AI Agent analyzes each transcript to understand its underlying structure—pacing, tone, curiosity hooks, and CTA placement\n* Using this analysis, Claude generates a completely original script that follows the same proven engagement formula but with a fresh topic or angle\n* Generated scripts are saved back to your Google Sheet alongside the source materials for comparison and refinement\n* A summary email is sent confirming the number of scripts created and ready for production\n\n## How to use\n\n* Start by entering a beauty or lifestyle hashtag (e.g., #aiautomation, #beautysalon, #haircare) and specify how many trending reels to analyze\n* Review the scraped content in your Google Sheet to understand what's currently resonating\n* Check the generated scripts and use them as jumping-off points for your own video production\n* Iterate on the process with different hashtags to discover emerging trends in your niche\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Apify account and API key for Instagram scraping (free tier available)\n* Google Sheets document set up to store reel data and generated scripts\n* OpenAI API key for the AI script generation\n* Gmail account for the completion notification (optional but recommended)\n\n## Customising this workflow\n\n* Adjust the engagement filter thresholds (currently 1000+ likes, 7 days old) to capture micro-trends or evergreen content\n* Modify the AI prompt in the \"AI Agent\" node to enforce specific brand voice, tone, or content guidelines\n* Add additional Google Sheet columns to track metrics like script-to-video conversion rates or audience response\n* Connect to additional distribution channels—automatically post scripts to team Slack, create video production briefs, or trigger video editing templates\n* Experiment with different video categories by creating multiple instances of this workflow for different hashtags or niches",
