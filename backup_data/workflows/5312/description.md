Transform simple ideas into viral-ready Bigfoot vlogs! This automated workflow creates charming 8-scene video content featuring "Sam" the Bigfoot - a lovable, outdoorsy character inspired by popular YouTube adventure channels.

**How It Works**

The workflow transforms your creative concept into professional video content through three automated stages:
1. Story Generation - AI creates an 8-scene narrative arc featuring Sam the Bigfoot, complete with character-consistent dialogue and engaging plot development
2. Human Approval - Review and approve the generated storyline via Slack before proceeding to video production
3. Video Production - Each scene is automatically converted into 8-second video clips using Google's VEO 3 AI, then uploaded to Google Drive for easy access
