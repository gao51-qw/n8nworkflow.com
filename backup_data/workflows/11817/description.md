# Your Own Personal Assistant

This workflow turns a Telegram bot into a simple Notion To-Do assistant.

Send a message in Telegram (text or voice). If it’s a voice message, the workflow downloads the audio and uses OpenAI to transcribe it into text. Then an AI agent (“Tard”) uses the latest message + a short memory of the recent chat to understand what you want and perform the right action in Notion (search your pages or create a new task/page in your To-Do list). The result is sent back to you in Telegram in a clean, readable format.

&gt; Email and Calendar nodes are included for future expansion but are disabled by default. The assistant is designed to work with Notion only.
