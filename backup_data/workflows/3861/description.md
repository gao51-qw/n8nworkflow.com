This workflow connects a USB scanner to Nextcloud via ScanservJS and the integrated API. It checks for new scans at a scheduled time (e.g., every 5 minutes). If there are any, they are automatically retrieved via HTTP request and then saved to a desired Nextcloud folder.

Ideal for home offices, offices, or maker projects with Raspberry Pi and network scanners.
