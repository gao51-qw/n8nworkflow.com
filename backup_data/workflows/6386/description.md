## This n8n workflow automatically detects canceled meetings from Calendly, uses GPT to write a friendly follow-up message, and sends it via Gmail, complete with a personalized Loom video link. It also creates an Asana task to remind your team to follow up manually if needed.

Ideal for B2B consultants, agencies, and sales teams who want to salvage missed opportunities and stay top-of-mind with prospects after no-shows.
