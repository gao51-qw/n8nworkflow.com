  "title": "Automate AWS IAM user management through email",
  "description": "This automated n8n workflow manages AWS IAM users (create, delete, update, assign to groups) directly from email commands with automatic confirmation responses.\n\n### Good to Know\n- The workflow processes email requests via a GET Email Request node.\n- Data extraction from emails is handled to identify user management commands.\n- Error handling is included for invalid or missing email data.\n- Responses are sent via email for each action performed.\n\n## How It Works\n- **GET Email Request** - Captures incoming email requests.\n- **Extract Data from Email** - Parses email content to extract user management commands.\n- **Check Type of Task** - Validates the type of task (e.g., create, delete, update).\n- **Get User** - Retrieves user details from AWS IAM.\n- **Get Many Users** - Fetches multiple user details if required.\n- **Create User** - Creates a new IAM user.\n- **Delete User** - Deletes an existing IAM user.\n- **Add to Group** - Assigns a user to a group.\n- **Remove from Group** - Removes a user from a group.\n- **Update User** - Updates user details.\n- **Make Message for Email** - Prepares a confirmation email.\n- **Send Email Response** - Sends the confirmation email.\n\n## How to Use\n- Import the workflow into n8n.\n- Configure the GET Email Request node to receive email commands.\n- Test the workflow with sample email commands (e.g., \"create user: john_doe\", \"add to group: admins\").\n- Monitor email responses and adjust command parsing if needed.\n\n## Requirements\n- AWS IAM credentials configured in n8n.\n- Email service integration (e.g., SMTP settings).\n- n8n environment with workflow execution permissions.\n\n## Customizing This Workflow\n- Adjust the Extract Data from Email node to support additional command formats.\n- Modify the Make Message for Email node to customize confirmation messages.\n- Update the AWS IAM nodes to include additional user attributes or group policies.",
