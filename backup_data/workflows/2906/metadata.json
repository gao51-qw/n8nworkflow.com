This ensures the workflow retrieves the correct market data.\n\n🔹 **Retrieve Daily Candlestick Chart**\nOnce the input is received, the workflow fetches the full-day candlestick chart for the selected crypto, providing a macro-level market trend.\n\n🔹 **AI Agent – Analyze Daily Chart**\nThe first AI agent, powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenRouter, analyzes the daily candlestick pattern to detect trends and potential market signals.\n\n🔹 **Fetch 5-Minute Candlestick Chart**\nTo refine the analysis, the workflow retrieves a 5-minute interval candlestick chart, allowing for real-time market movement evaluation.\n\n🔹 **AI Agent – Advanced Candlestick Analysis**\nThis AI agent combines the 5-minute chart with the daily analysis to provide an in-depth market prediction. Here’s where the real magic happens—AI interprets short-term trends in the context of long-term movements.\n\n🔹 **Shared Windows Buffer – Store Intermediate Results**\nThe Windows Buffer temporarily stores analysis results, ensuring seamless data flow between AI agents for a more structured interpretation.\n\n🔹 **Serp API – Retrieve Crypto News**\nTo add fundamental analysis, the Serp API tool fetches the latest crypto-related news from the web, providing additional market context.\n\n🔹 **Chat Window – Deliver Final Insights**\nOnce all data points are processed, the final market analysis is displayed in the chat window, combining technical and fundamental analysis for a more comprehensive trading strategy.\n\n## Use Case:\n\nThis automation simplifies crypto market analysis by integrating AI-driven technical and fundamental insights. It’s ideal for:\n\n✅ Traders looking for automated market insights\n✅ Analysts seeking structured candlestick interpretations\n✅ Developers wanting to integrate AI-powered trading analysis into applications\n\nBy automating candlestick chart analysis, this workflow enhances decision-making and reduces manual effort, making it a valuable tool for anyone involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\n## Setup Instructions:\n\n1️⃣ Import the workflow to your n8n instance\n\n2️⃣ Prepare & add credentials:\n\n1.
