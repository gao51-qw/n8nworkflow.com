## Workflow Breakdown:

🔹 1. **Chat Node – Provide Crypto Information**
Users enter a crypto symbol in the required format (EXCHANGE:SYMBOL), such as BINANCE:BTCUSDT. This ensures the workflow retrieves the correct market data.

🔹 **Retrieve Daily Candlestick Chart**
Once the input is received, the workflow fetches the full-day candlestick chart for the selected crypto, providing a macro-level market trend.

🔹 **AI Agent – Analyze Daily Chart**
The first AI agent, powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenRouter, analyzes the daily candlestick pattern to detect trends and potential market signals.

🔹 **Fetch 5-Minute Candlestick Chart**
To refine the analysis, the workflow retrieves a 5-minute interval candlestick chart, allowing for real-time market movement evaluation.

🔹 **AI Agent – Advanced Candlestick Analysis**
This AI agent combines the 5-minute chart with the daily analysis to provide an in-depth market prediction. Here’s where the real magic happens—AI interprets short-term trends in the context of long-term movements.

🔹 **Shared Windows Buffer – Store Intermediate Results**
The Windows Buffer temporarily stores analysis results, ensuring seamless data flow between AI agents for a more structured interpretation.

🔹 **Serp API – Retrieve Crypto News**
To add fundamental analysis, the Serp API tool fetches the latest crypto-related news from the web, providing additional market context.

🔹 **Chat Window – Deliver Final Insights**
Once all data points are processed, the final market analysis is displayed in the chat window, combining technical and fundamental analysis for a more comprehensive trading strategy.
