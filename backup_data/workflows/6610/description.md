**Description:**

Streamline your cloud storage with this powerful Google Drive File Renamer automation built with n8n. The workflow watches a specific Google Drive folder and automatically renames new files using a standardized format based on their creation date and time—ideal for organizing images, backups, and uploads with consistent timestamp-based names.
Whether you're managing daily uploads, sorting Instagram-ready content, or organizing client submissions, this timestamp-based file naming system ensures consistent and searchable file structures—without manual intervention.
