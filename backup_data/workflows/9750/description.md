This workflow automates the entire process of creating SEO-optimized meta titles and descriptions. It analyzes your webpage, spies on top-ranking competitors for the same keywords, and then uses a multi-step AI process to generate compelling, length-constrained meta tags.

**🤖 How It Works**
This workflow operates in a three-phase process for each URL you provide:

*Phase 1: Self-Analysis*

When you add a URL to a Google Sheet with the status "New", the workflow scrapes your page's content.

The first AI then performs a deep analysis to identify the page's primary keyword, semantic keyword cluster, search intent, and target audience.

*Phase 2: Competitor Intelligence*

The workflow takes your primary keyword and performs a live Google search.

A custom code block intelligently filters the search results to identify true competitors.

A second AI analyzes their meta titles and descriptions to find common patterns and successful strategies.

*Phase 3: Master Generation & Update*

The final AI synthesizes all gathered intelligence—your page's data and the competitor's winning patterns—to generate a new, optimized meta title and description.

It then writes this new data back to your Google Sheet and updates the status to "Generated".
