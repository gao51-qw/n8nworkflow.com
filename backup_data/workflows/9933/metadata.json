  "description": "This n8n workflow is the data ingestion pipeline for the \"RAG System V2\" chatbot. It automatically monitors a specific Google Drive folder for new files, processes them based on their type, and inserts their content into a Supabase vector database to make it searchable for the RAG agent.\n\nKey Features & Workflow:\n\nGoogle Drive Trigger: The workflow starts automatically when a new file is created in a designated folder (named \"DOCUMENTS\" in this template).\n\nSmart File Handling: A Switch node routes the file based on its MIME type (e.g., PDF, Excel, Google Doc, Word Doc) for correct processing.\n\nMulti-Format Extraction:\n\nPDF: Text is extracted directly using the Extract PDF Text node.\n\nGoogle Docs: Files are downloaded and converted to plain text (text/plain) and processed by the Extract from Text File node.\n\nExcel: Data is extracted, aggregated, and concatenated into a single text block for embedding.\n\nWord (.doc/.docx): Word files are automatically converted into Google Docs format using an HTTP Request. This newly created Google Doc will then trigger the entire workflow again, ensuring it's processed correctly.\n\nChunking & Metadata Enrichment: The extracted text is split into manageable chunks using the Recursive Character Text Splitter (set to 2000-character chunks). The Enhanced Default Data Loader then enriches these chunks with crucial metadata from the original file, such as file_name, creator, and created_at.\n\nVectorization & Storage: Finally, the workflow uses OpenAI Embeddings to create vector representations of the text chunks and inserts them into the Supabase Vector Store.",
