  "description": "**This suite automates distinct aspects of real estate operations: incoming web lead qualification, scheduled/manual data research and content generation, and automated voice call outreach with lead qualification. It leverages AI (primarily OpenAI GPT-4o Mini via Langchain), data processing nodes, and integrations with external APIs and Google Workspace.**\n\n# Workflow 1: Incoming Web Lead Qualification & Scoring\nThis workflow captures leads from a web source, validates their input, uses AI to classify intent and urgency, checks against a property database, scores the lead, and prepares a structured lead object.\n\n# Tools & Services Used:\n\nAI Core & Processing: OpenAI (GPT-4o Mini via Langchain Agent and Chat Model nodes)\nData Processing: n8n Set, If, Code nodes\nExternal API: HTTP Request node (for PropertyCheckAPI)\n# Workflow Overview:\nTrigger:\nIncoming Web Lead Webhook (/incoming-lead): Captures new leads submitted via a web form.\nLead Data Ingestion & Validation:\nSet & Rename Incoming Lead Fields: Standardizes input field names from the webhook.\nIF User Message Valid: Checks if the userMessage field is present and meets a minimum length.\nClean User Message Text (Code): Pre-processes the user's message (e.g., removes extra spaces).\nAI-Powered Lead Analysis:\nAI Classify Lead Intent & Urgency (Langchain Agent): Analyzes the cleaned user message to determine the lead's primary intent (e.g., buying, selling, inquiry) and the urgency of their request.\nPowered by: LLM for Lead Intent/Urgency Classification (OpenAI Chat Model - GPT-4o Mini).\nExtract Intent & Urgency from AI Output (Set): Structures the AI's classification into distinct fields.\nData Standardization & Enrichment:\nStandardize All Lead Data Fields (Code): Further standardizes all collected data points for consistency.\nCall Property Check API (HTTP Request): Sends lead/property details to an external API (https://api.example.com/property-check) to verify listing status or gather more information.\nLead Scoring & Finalization:\nIF Property is Known Listing: Checks the API response to see if a matchFound was \"true\".\nCalculate Web Lead Score (Code): If a known listing (or based on other criteria), this node assigns a numerical or categorical score to the lead.\nSet Final Structured Web Lead Data (Set): Consolidates all original, processed, classified, and scored data into a final, comprehensive lead object.\n## Workflow 2: Scheduled/Manual AI-Powered Data Research & Content Generation (Red Background)\nThis workflow fetches data from external URLs, extracts information using AI, allows a sophisticated AI agent to perform research and generate analysis using various tools, and outputs results to Google Sheets, Google Docs, and potentially other AI processing steps.\n\n# Tools & Services Used:\nOrchestration & Automation: n8n\nAI Core & Processing: OpenAI (GPT-4o Mini via Langchain Information Extractor, Langchain Agent, and direct OpenAI nodes)\nAI Tools: Langchain Calculator, Langchain SerpAPI\nData Storage & Output: Google Sheets, Google Docs\nData Input: HTTP Request node\n\n# Workflow Overview:\nTriggers:\nManual Trigger for Data Analysis Flow: Allows on-demand execution.\nScheduled Trigger for Data Analysis Flow: Automates execution on a defined schedule.\nData Ingestion & Initial Extraction:\nFetch External Data for AI Analysis (HTTP Request): Retrieves content from a specified URL.\nAI Extract Information from Fetched Data (Langchain Information Extractor): Uses an AI model to extract structured data from the fetched content.\nPowered by: LLM for Data Information Extractor (OpenAI Chat Model - GPT-4o Mini).\nAdvanced AI Analysis & Tasking:\nAI Agent for Research & Content Generation (Langchain Agent): Processes the extracted information to perform in-depth research, analysis, or content creation.\nPowered by: LLM for Research & Content AI Agent (OpenAI Chat Model - GPT-4o Mini).\nUtilizes Tools:\nCalculator Tool for AI Agent: For numerical calculations.\nSerpAPI Web Search Tool for AI Agent: For performing real-time web searches to gather additional context or verify information.\nOutput & Dissemination:\nThe AI Agent's output is routed to multiple destinations:\nUpdate Google Doc with AI Agent Analysis (Google Docs): Inserts the generated analysis/content into a Google Document.\nSplit AI Agent Output Items (Split Out) -&gt; Log AI Analysis Data to Google Sheets (Google Sheets): If the agent produces multiple data items, they are split and logged individually into a Google Sheet.\nOpenAI: Generate Text from Agent (Output 1) & OpenAI: Generate Text from Agent (Output 2): These nodes likely take the agent's output for further specialized AI processing (e.g., summarization for different purposes, reformatting).\n## Workflow 3: Automated Lead Outreach & Voice Call Qualification (Green Background)\nThis workflow automates the initial contact with new leads via a voice call, uses AI to understand the lead's responses during the call, qualifies them, and logs the detailed interaction and a summary.\n# Tools & Services Used:\nOrchestration & Automation: n8n\nAI Core & Processing: OpenAI (GPT-4o Mini via Langchain Agent and Chat Model nodes)\nVoice Services: ElevenLabs (Text-to-Speech via HTTP Request), Twilio (Place Call via HTTP Request)\nData Storage & Output: Google Sheets\nError Handling: n8n Execute Workflow Trigger\n# Workflow Overview:\nTrigger:\nWebhook for Voice Call Lead (/new-lead): Captures new leads designated for an automated voice call.\nCall Preparation & Initiation:\nSet Initial Voice Call Lead Details: Extracts basic lead info (name, phone, property ref, email) from the webhook.\nGenerate Voice Call Introduction Script (Function): Creates a personalized script for the call.\nElevenLabs: Convert Intro Script to Voice (HTTP Request): Sends the script to ElevenLabs API to generate natural-sounding audio.\nTwilio: Initiate Voice Call to Lead (HTTP Request): Uses Twilio API to place the call and play the generated audio.\nAI-Powered Call Interaction Analysis:\nAI Agent: Extract Info from Voice Call (Langchain Agent): Processes the interaction from the call (e.g., a transcript of the lead's responses, or DTMF inputs if designed to capture them) to extract key qualification data like budget, timeline, and interest level.\nPowered by: LLM for Voice Call Info Extraction Agent (OpenAI Chat Model - GPT-4o Mini).\nStructure Extracted Voice Call Info (Function): Organizes the AI-extracted data into a structured JSON object.\nLead Qualification & Data Logging:\nSet Lead Status Based on Call Interest: Updates the lead's status (e.g., \"Interested\" or \"Not Interested\") based on the AI's interpretation of the call.\nIF Lead Interested (from Voice Call): Branches the workflow based on lead status.\nIf Interested:\nAssign Score to Interested Voice Lead (Function): Calculates a lead score based on budget, timeline, etc.\nFormat Current Timestamp for Logging (DateTime): Generates a timestamp.\nLog Qualified Voice Lead to Google Sheets: Appends the detailed, qualified lead information to a 'Leads' Google Sheet.\nAI Agent: Generate Voice Call Lead Summary (Langchain Agent): Creates a concise summary of the entire lead interaction and qualification.\nPowered by: LLM for Voice Call Lead Summary Agent (OpenAI Chat Model - GPT-4o Mini).\nLog Voice Call Lead Summary to Google Sheets: Appends this summary to a separate 'LeadsSummary' Google Sheet.\nError Handling (for Sheets Logging):\nIF Voice Lead Logging to Sheets Failed: Checks if the Google Sheets logging operation was unsuccessful.\nError Trigger: Notify Admin of Sheets Failure (Execute Workflow Trigger): If logging fails, triggers a separate workflow to alert an administrator.\n",
