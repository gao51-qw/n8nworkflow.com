  "description": "This workflow implements cutting-edge concepts from **Google DeepMind's OPRO** (Optimization by PROmpting) and **Stanford's DSPy** to automatically refine AI prompts. It iteratively generates, evaluates, and optimizes responses against a ground truth, allowing you to \"compile\" your prompts for maximum accuracy.\n\n## Why this is powerful\n\nInstead of manually tweaking prompts (trial and error), this workflow treats prompt engineering as an **optimization problem**:\n- **OPRO-style Optimization**: The \"Optimizer\" LLM analyzes past performance scores and reasons to mathematically deduce a better prompt.\n- **DSPy-style Logic**: It separates the \"Logic\" (Workflow) from the \"Parameters\" (Prompts), allowing the system to self-correct until it matches the Ground Truth.\n\n## How it works\n\n- **Define**: Set your initial prompt and a test case with the expected answer (Ground Truth).\n- **Generate**: The workflow generates a response using the current prompt.\n- **Evaluate**: An AI Evaluator scores the response (0-100) based on accuracy and format.\n- **Optimize**: If the score is low, the Optimizer AI analyzes the failure and rewrites the prompt.\n- **Loop**: The process repeats until the score reaches 95/100 or the loop limit is hit.\n\n## Setup steps\n\n1. **Configure OpenAI**: Ensure you have an OpenAI credential set up in the `OpenAI Chat Model` node.\n2. **Customize**: Open the `Define Initial Prompt & Test Data` node and set your `initial_prompt`, `test_input`, and `ground_truth`.\n3. **Run**: Execute the workflow and check the `Manage Loop & State` node output for the optimized prompt.\n",
