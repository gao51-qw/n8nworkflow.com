  "description": "# Telegram Personal Assistant with Long-Term Memory & Note-Taking\n\nThis n8n workflow transforms your Telegram bot into a powerful personal assistant that handles **voice, photo, and text messages**. The assistant uses AI to interpret messages, save important details as long-term memories or notes in a Baserow database, and recall information for future interactions.\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 How It Works\n\n1. **Message Reception & Routing**  \n   - **Telegram Integration:** The workflow is triggered by incoming messages on your Telegram bot.  \n   - **Dynamic Routing:** A switch node inspects the message to determine whether it's voice, text, or photo (with captions) and routes it for the appropriate processing.\n\n2. **Content Processing**  \n   - **Voice Messages:** Audio files are retrieved and sent to an AI transcription node to convert spoken words into text.  \n   - **Text Messages:** Text is directly captured and prepared for analysis.  \n   - **Photos:** If an image is received, the bot fetches the file (and caption, if provided) and uses an AI-powered image analysis node to extract relevant details.\n\n3. **AI-Powered Agent & Memory Management**  \n   - The core AI agent (powered by GPT-4o-mini) processes the incoming message along with any previous conversation history stored in PostgreSQL memory buffers.  \n   - **Long-Term Memory:** When a message contains personal or noteworthy information, the assistant uses a dedicated tool to save this data as a long-term memory in Baserow.  \n   - **Note-Taking:** For specific instructions or reminders, the assistant saves concise notes in a separate Baserow table.  \n   - The AI agent follows defined rules to decide which details are saved as memories and which are saved as notes.\n\n4. **Response Generation**  \n   - After processing the message and updating memory/notes as needed, the AI agent crafts a contextual and personalized response.  \n   - The response is sent back to the user via Telegram, ensuring smooth and natural conversation flow.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Key Features\n\n- **Multimodal Input:**  \n  Seamlessly handles voice, photo (with captions), and text messages.\n\n- **Long-Term Memory & Note-Taking:**  \n  Uses a Baserow database to store personal details and notes, enhancing conversational context over time.\n\n- **AI-Driven Contextual Responses:**  \n  Leverages an AI agent to generate personalized, context-aware replies based on current input and past interactions.\n\n- **User Security & Validation:**  \n  Incorporates validation steps to verify the user's Telegram ID before processing, ensuring secure and personalized interactions.\n\n- **Easy Baserow Setup:**  \n  Comes with a clear setup guide and sample configurations to quickly integrate Baserow for managing memories and notes.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Setup Guide\n\n1. **Telegram Bot Setup:**  \n   - Create your bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and obtain the Bot Token.  \n   - Configure the Telegram webhook in n8n with your bot's token and URL.\n\n2. **Baserow Database Configuration:**  \n   - **Memory Table:**  \n     - Create a workspace titled \"Memories and Notes\".  \n     - Set up a table (e.g., \"Memory Table\") with at least two fields:  \n       - **Memory** (long text)  \n       - **Date Added** (US date format with time)  \n   - **Notes Table:**  \n     - Duplicate the Memory Table and rename it to \"Notes Table\".  \n     - Change the first field's name from \"Memory\" to \"Notes\".\n\n3. **n8n Workflow Import & Configuration:**  \n   - Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.  \n   - Update credentials for Telegram, Baserow, OpenAI, and PostgreSQL (for memory buffering) as needed.\n   - Adjust node settings if you need to customize AI agent prompts or memory management rules.\n\n4. **Testing & Deployment:**  \n   - Test your bot by sending various message types (text, voice, photo) to confirm that the workflow processes them correctly, updates Baserow, and returns the appropriate response.  \n   - Monitor logs to ensure that memory and note entries are correctly stored and retrieved.\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Example Interactions\n\n- **Voice Message Processing:**  \n  - *User sends a voice note requesting a reminder.*  \n  - **Bot Response:** \"Thanks for your message! I've noted your reminder and saved it for future reference.\"\n\n- **Photo with Caption:**  \n  - *User sends a photo with the caption \"Save this recipe for dinner ideas.\"*  \n  - **Bot Response:** \"Got it! I've saved this recipe along with the caption for you.\"\n\n- **Text Message for Memory Saving:**  \n  - *User: \"I love hiking on weekends.\"*  \n  - **Bot Response:** \"Noted! I’ll remember your interest in hiking.\"\n\n- **Retrieving Information:**  \n  - *User asks: \"What notes do I have?\"*  \n  - **Bot Response:** \"Here are your latest notes: [list of saved notes].\"\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Resources & Next Steps\n\n- **Telegram Bot Configuration:** [Telegram BotFather Guide](https://t.me/BotFather)  \n- **n8n Documentation:** [n8n Docs](https://docs.n8n.io/)  \n- **Community Forums:** Join discussions and share your customizations!\n\n---\n\nThis workflow not only streamlines message processing but also empowers users with a personal AI assistant that remembers details over time. Customize the rules and responses further to fit your unique requirements and enjoy a more engaging, intelligent conversation experience on Telegram!\n\n---",
