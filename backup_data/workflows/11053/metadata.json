  "description": "This workflow automates reputation management for physical stores (restaurants, retail, clinics) by monitoring Google Maps reviews, analyzing them with AI, and drafting professional replies.\n\nIt acts as a 24/7 customer support assistant, ensuring you never miss a negative review and saving hours of manual writing time.\n\n## Who is this for?\n- **Store Managers & Owners:** Keep track of customer sentiment without manually checking Google Maps every day.\n- **Marketing Agencies:** Automate local SEO reporting and response drafting for multiple clients.\n- **Customer Support Teams:** Get instant alerts for negative feedback to resolve issues quickly.\n\n## How it works\n1. **Schedule:** Runs every 24 hours (customizable) to fetch the latest data.\n2. **Scrape:** Uses **Apify** to retrieve the latest reviews from a specific Google Maps URL.\n3. **Filter:** Checks the **Google Sheet** database to identify only new reviews and avoid duplicates.\n4. **AI Analysis:** An **AI Agent** (via OpenRouter/OpenAI) analyzes the review text to:\n   - Generate a short summary.\n   - Draft a polite, context-aware reply based on the star rating (e.g., apologies for low stars, gratitude for high stars).\n5. **Alert:** Sends a **Slack** notification.\n   - **Low Rating (&lt;4 stars):** Alerts a specific channel (e.g., #customer-support) with a warning.\n   - **High Rating:** Alerts a general channel (e.g., #wins) to celebrate.\n6. **Save:** Appends the review details, AI summary, and draft reply to the Google Sheet.\n\n## Requirements\n- **n8n:** Cloud or self-hosted (v1.0+).\n- **Apify Account:** To run the *Google Maps Reviews Scraper*.\n- **Google Cloud Platform:** Enabled Google Sheets API.\n- **Slack Workspace:** A webhook URL or OAuth connection.\n- **OpenRouter (or OpenAI) API Key:** For the LLM generation.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Google Sheets:** Create a new sheet with the following headers in the first row:\n   `reviewId`, `publishedAt`, `reviewerName`, `stars`, `text`, `ai_summary`, `ai_reply`, `reviewUrl`, `output`, `publishedAt date`.\n2. **Configure Credentials:** Set up your accounts for Google Sheets, Apify, Slack, and OpenRouter within n8n.\n3. **Edit the \"CONFIG\" Node:**\n   - `MAPS_URL`: Paste the full Google Maps link to your store.\n   - `SHEET_ID`: Paste the ID found in your Google Sheet URL.\n   - `SHOP_NAME`: Your store's name.\n4. **Slack Nodes:** Select the appropriate channels for positive and negative alerts.\n\n## How to customize\n- **Change the AI Persona:** Open the **AI Agent** node and modify the \"System Message\" to match your brand's tone of voice (e.g., casual, formal, or witty).\n- **Adjust Alert Thresholds:** Edit the **If Rating &lt; 4** node to change the criteria for what constitutes a \"negative\" review (e.g., strictly &lt; 3 stars).\n- **Multi-Store Support:** You can loop this workflow over a list of URLs to manage multiple locations in a single execution.",
