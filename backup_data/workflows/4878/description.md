This workflow helps you keep an eye on your GitHub forks, notifying you when they fall behind or pull ahead of their upstream repositories.

**How It Works**
- Fetches All Your Repos: The workflow starts by grabbing a list of all repositories owned by your GitHub account.
- Filters for Forks: It then intelligently filters this list to identify only your forked repositories.
- Compares Branches: For each identified fork, it compares its default branch against the upstream repository's default branch to find out how many commits it's ahead or behind.
- Filters for Changes: Only forks that are either ahead or behind their upstream (i.e., not perfectly in sync) are processed further.
- Generates Report: A concise, well-formatted report is compiled, highlighting the status and commit differences for each relevant fork.
- Sends Telegram Notification: Finally, this report is sent directly to your Telegram chat, keeping you informed in real-time.

**Setup Steps**
- Copy the template 
- Update triggers ( optional ) 
- Update the credentials 

**Prerequisites**
- **GitHub Credentials**: You'll need to provide your GitHub personal access token for the "Get All Repositories" and "Compare Branches API Call" nodes.
- **Telegram Bot Setup**: Configure a Telegram Bot and obtain its API token and your chat ID for the "Send Report" node.
- **Github Owner Username**: Update the "Get All Repositories" node with the GitHub username of the repository owner whose forks you want to monitor.
