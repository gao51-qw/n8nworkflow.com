  "description": "## 📊 Visualize all your AI Token Usage analytics Dashboard using a single n8n Workflow\n---\n![TokenEstim8rUIGumroadBanner.jpg](fileId:1107)\nArtwork Generated with **[✨ ideoGener8r](ideoGener8r)** n8n workflow template\n\n---\n\nToken Estim8r UI is the premium version of our token tracking solution for n8n users who want real-time insight into AI model usage and exact cost per execution — all in a beautifully designed analytics dashboard.\n\nWe've done the work with **over 4000 lines of code** for you to simply add a pre-configured **HTTP Request node** to the end of any workflow you want to track, and Token Estim8r UI will handle the rest: collecting data, analyzing token usage, calculating model costs, and **feeding everything into a clean UI with charts, graphs, and summaries**.\n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ What the Dashboard Looks Like\n![Token Estim8r Dashboard](https://fillin8n.realsimple.dev/TokenEstim8r-ScreenCap.png)\n\n---\n\n### 🙋‍♂️ Who is this for?\nThis workflow is perfect for:\n- AI engineers\n- Automation specialists\n- Business analysts\n- Teams using OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, or any token-based LLM\n\nIf you’re managing API budgets or optimizing prompt performance, this tool provides immediate visibility into where tokens (and money) are going.\n\n---\n\n### 😌 What problem does this solve?\nn8n makes it easy to build powerful workflows — but it doesn’t natively track OpenAI token usage or cost. Without that visibility, it’s impossible to:\n- Know what each automation is costing\n- Spot inefficiencies in prompt construction\n- Track cost trends over time\n\n**Token Estim8r UI solves that with zero manual logging.**\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ What this workflow does\n- Fetches detailed execution logs from n8n\n- Extracts prompt/completion token usage per model/tool\n- Optionally retrieves live pricing or use preset pricing as of 4/2025\n- Calculates total cost per run\n- Sends data to a backend for aggregation\n-  Displays a full-featured analytics dashboard with:\n    - Total tokens, cost, and usage trends\n    - Most used models/tools\n    - Workflow-model correlations\n    - Cost breakdowns and comparisons\n    - Workflow usage over time\n    - **Auto-complete workflow search** with filtering by ID or name\n    - **Filter by date or workflow** (single or all workflows)\n    - Built in image server\n    - **Sortable & searchable data table** of filtered results with:\n        - Prompt & completion token breakdown\n        - Cost calculations\n        - Workflow name + direct link to the workflow\n        - Link to exact execution in n8n\n\n---\n\n\n### 🛠️ How Setup Works\n1. Import the Token Estim8r UI workflow into your n8n instance\n2. Deploy the included dashboard (React/Next.js app, hosted or self-hosted)\n3. Configure Google Sheets or your preferred backend (e.g., Supabase, Airtable)\n4. Copy the prebuilt HTTP Request node into the end of any n8n workflow\n5. Run your workflow — data is captured, aggregated and stored automatically in Google Sheets 🎉\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 What Makes This Better than the simple version?\nThe simple version logs to Google Sheets only. This premium UI version adds:\n- Full analytics dashboard\n- Cost aggregation across all workflows\n- Graphs, filters, and model/tool comparisons\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Customization Ideas\n- Switch backend to Supabase or Firebase\n- Add alerts via Slack when costs exceed thresholds\n- Build weekly token cost summaries\n- Track model performance across teams\n- Add filters by user/session/timeframe\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Why Users Love It\n\"Token Estim8r UI is exactly what I needed to take control of my AI costs inside n8n. It’s plug and play — and the dashboard makes optimization easy.\"  \n– Beta user, AI Ops Lead\n\n## 😐 If you're serious about building with AI in n8n, \nToken Estim8r UI gives you the visibility to scale confidently. 🚀",
