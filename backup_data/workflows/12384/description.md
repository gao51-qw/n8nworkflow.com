## How It Works
This workflow provides enterprise-grade translation and text-to-speech automation for international communication teams, content publishers, and localization services. It addresses producing high-quality multilingual audio content with consistent accuracy and natural delivery at scale. An AI orchestrator analyzes source content to determine optimal translation strategy, selecting specialized agents based on content type, complexity, and target languages. The translation agent processes text with contextual awareness, generating structured output that feeds into ElevenLabs' neural text-to-speech engine. Each audio file undergoes automated quality validation checking pronunciation accuracy, natural flow, and technical specifications. High-quality outputs proceed to standardized formatting for delivery, while failures trigger dedicated error handling with diagnostic reporting, ensuring reliable production of professional multilingual audio assets.
