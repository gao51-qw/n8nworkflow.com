  "description": "Fetches workflow definitions from within n8n, selecting only the ones that have one or more (configurable) assigned tags and then:\n1. Derives a suitable backup filename by reducing the workflow name to a string with alphanumeric characters and no-spaces\n    * *Note: This isn't bulletproof, but works as long as workflow names aren't too crazy.*\n2. Determines which workflows need to be backed up based on whether each one:\n    * has been modified. (*Note: Even repositioning a node counts.*)\n   ...or...\n    * is new. (*Note: Renaming counts as this.*)\n3. Commits JSON copies of each workflow, as necessary, to a Gitlab repository with a generated, date-stamped commit message.\n\n## Setup\n### Credentials\n  * Create a Gitlab Credentials item and assign it to all Gitlab nodes.\n  * Create an n8n Credentials item and assign it to the n8n node\n    * Note: This was tested with **http://localhost:5678/api/v1** but should work with any reachable n8n instance and API key.\n\n### Modify these values in the \"Globals\" Node\n  * **gitlab_owner** - {{your gitlab account}}\n  * **gitlab_project** - {{ your gitlab project name }}\n  * **gitlab_workflow_path** - {{ subdirectory in the project where backup files should be saved/committed }}\n  * **tags_to_match_for_backup** - {{tag(s) to match for backup selection}}\n    * ***ALERT:** According to the **n8n** node's **Filters -&gt; tags** field annotations, and API documentation, this supports a CSV list of multiple tags (e.g. tag1,tag2), **but** the API behavior requires workflows to have **all-of** the listed tags, not **any-of** them.*\n      * **See:** https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/10348\n      * **TL/DR** - Don't expect a multiple tag list to be **more** inclusive.\n      * **Possible workaround:** To match more than one tag value, duplicate the n8n node into multiple single-tag matches, or split and iterate multiple values, and merge the results.\n\n## Possible Enhancements\n* Make the branch (\"Reference\") for all the gitlab nodes configurable.  Fixed on all as \"main\" in the template.\n* Add an n8n node to generate an audit and store the output in gitlab along with the backups.\n* Extend the workflow at the end to create a Gitlab release/tag whenever any backup files are actually updated or created.\n\n\n",
