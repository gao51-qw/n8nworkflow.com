    "description": "In this tutorial, I’ll show how to create UGC (User Generated Content) videos automatically using n8n and Sora 2.\n\nThis workflow uses OpenAI to generate detailed prompts and Sora 2 to produce realistic UGC-style videos that look natural and engaging.\n\n### Who is this for?\n\n*   Marketers and social media managers scaling short-form video content  \n      \n    \n*   Agencies producing branded or influencer-style content  \n      \n    \n*   Content creators and freelancers automating their video workflows  \n      \n    \n*   Anyone exploring AI-driven video generation and automation  \n      \n    \n\n### What problem is this workflow solving?\n\nCreating authentic, human-like UGC videos manually takes time and effort.  \nThis workflow automates the entire process by:\n\n*   Generating engaging scripts or prompts via OpenAI  \n      \n    \n*   Sending those prompts to Sora 2 for automatic video generation  \n      \n    \n*   Managing rendering and delivery inside n8n  \n      \n    \n*   Eliminating manual editing and production steps  \n      \n    \n\n### What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow connects n8n, OpenAI, and Sora 2 to fully automate the creation of short-form UGC videos.\n\nThe steps include:\n\n1.  Taking user input (topic, tone, niche).  \n      \n    \n2.  Using OpenAI to create a detailed video prompt.  \n      \n    \n3.  Sending the prompt to Sora 2 via HTTP Request to generate the video.  \n      \n    \n4.  Handling video rendering and storing or sending results automatically.  \n      \n    \n\nBy the end, you’ll have a complete UGC video pipeline running on autopilot — producing content for under $1.50 per video.\n\n### Setup\n\n1.  Create Accounts:  \n      \n    \n\n*   Sign up for [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) (cloud or self-hosted).  \n      \n    \n*   Get access to OpenAI API and Sora 2.  \n      \n    \n\n3.  Generate API Keys:  \n      \n    \n\n*   Retrieve API keys from OpenAI and Sora 2.  \n      \n    \n*   Store them securely in n8n credentials.  \n      \n    \n\n5.  Create Workflow:  \n      \n    \n\n*   Add a Form Trigger or Webhook Trigger for input (topic, target audience).  \n      \n    \n*   Add an OpenAI Node to generate script prompts.  \n      \n    \n*   Connect an HTTP Request Node to send the prompt to Sora 2.  \n      \n    \n*   Use a Wait Node or delay logic for video rendering completion.  \n      \n    \n*   Store or send the output video file via Gmail, Telegram, or Google Drive.  \n      \n    \n\n7.  Test the Workflow:  \n      \n    \n\n*   Run a test topic.  \n      \n    \n*   Confirm that Sora 2 generates and returns a video automatically.  \n      \n    \n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n*   Adjust OpenAI prompts for specific video styles (tutorials, product demos, testimonials).  \n      \n    \n*   Integrate video output with social media platforms via n8n nodes.  \n      \n    \n*   Add text-to-speech layers for voiceover automation.  \n      \n    \n*   Schedule automatic content creation using Cron triggers.  \n      \n    \n*   Connect with Notion or Airtable to manage content ideas.  \n      \n    \n\n### Notes\n\n*   You’ll need valid API keys for both OpenAI and Sora 2.  \n      \n    \n*   Sora 2 may charge per render (approx. $1–$1.50 per video).  \n      \n    \n*   Ensure your workflow includes sufficient delay/wait handling for video rendering.  \n      \n    \n*   Works seamlessly on n8n Cloud or self-hosted setups.  \n      \n    \n\n### Want a Video Tutorial on How to Set Up This Automation?\n\n👉 [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/H0AQU4ColME)",

Just a living, breathing character portrait so vivid they could walk off the page.\n\n// INPUT DATA //\n\nProduct Name: {{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}\n\n// DELIVERABLE FORMAT //\nConstruct your persona using these five dimensions. Prioritize specificity and texture over generic descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 1: Foundation & Social Coordinates\n\n**Full Name:** (First and last—make it feel real)\n**Exact Age:** (Choose one specific age)\n**Gender Identity:**\n**Geographic Context:** (Paint the picture: \"Lives in a converted loft in Nashville's Germantown district,\" \"Calls a quiet coastal town in Oregon home\")\n**Professional Life:** (Precision matters: instead of \"works in healthcare,\" say \"Emergency Room physician assistant\" or \"Runs a small batch bakery from a commercial kitchen\")\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 2: Visual Signature & Aesthetic Expression\n\n**Physical Presence:** How do they appear when they enter a room? Describe facial features, body language, and the energy they radiate.\n\n**Hair Story:** What's happening on their head? (e.g., \"Natural curls kept short and well-moisturized,\" \"Silver-streaked dark hair worn in a perpetual low ponytail\")\n\n**Wardrobe Philosophy:** What's their uniform? Use evocative, specific language. (e.g., \"Lives in quality basics—Everlane tees, raw denim, white leather sneakers,\" \"Maximalist thrifter with a weakness for oversized blazers and vintage band tees,\" \"Patagonia fleeces and functional outdoor gear year-round\")\n\n**Distinguishing Marks:** What makes them visually memorable? (e.g., \"Calloused hands from weekend woodworking,\" \"Smile lines that suggest they laugh often,\" \"A small tattoo on their wrist of coordinates,\" \"Always carries a well-worn canvas tote\")\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 3: Inner Wiring & Expression Style\n\n**Character Architecture:** Name 6-8 defining traits that shape who they are (Examples: Methodical, warmly skeptical, quietly ambitious, unfailingly punctual, empathetic but boundaried, playfully sarcastic)\n\n**Interpersonal Frequency:** What's their default mode with others? (e.g., \"Measured and thoughtful—the person who listens more than they talk,\" \"Radiates easy warmth without trying too hard,\" \"Direct and no-nonsense, but never harsh\")\n\n**Voice & Verbal Patterns:** Capture HOW they speak, not just what they say. (e.g., \"Uses precise language like someone who reads a lot,\" \"Peppers conversation with self-deprecating humor,\" \"Talks in practical, solution-oriented sentences,\" \"Speaks with the casual expertise of someone who actually knows their stuff\")\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 4: Life Texture & Operational Reality\n\n**Time Outside Work:** How do they spend their discretionary hours? (e.g., \"Refinishes vintage furniture found on Facebook Marketplace, trains for half-marathons, obsessively researches coffee brewing methods\")\n\n**Guiding Principles:** What philosophical operating system runs their decisions? (e.g., \"Believes in intentional consumption over mindless accumulation,\" \"Lives by the mantra 'done is better than perfect,'\" \"Prioritizes experiences and relationships over material possessions\")\n\n**Recurring Friction Points:** What low-grade problems nag at them regularly? Keep this category-adjacent, not product-specific. (e.g., \"Constantly battles decision fatigue about small purchases,\" \"Feels guilty about not drinking enough water,\" \"Struggles with managing digital clutter,\" \"Never feels like there's enough hours in the day\")\n\n**Living Space Aesthetic:** Describe their domestic environment. (e.g., \"Mid-century modern meets cozy—lots of wood tones, plants, and warm textiles,\" \"Functional minimalism with a few carefully chosen art pieces,\" \"Lived-in comfort with stacks of books and mismatched vintage furniture\")\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 5: The Trust Factor\n\n**Authenticity Anchor:** In 2-3 sentences, articulate the precise reason an audience would find THIS person's product endorsement credible and persuasive. What about their lived experience, expertise, or values makes their voice carry weight in this context?\n\n(e.g., \"As someone who's spent years optimizing small efficiencies in a chaotic work environment, her product recommendations feel battle-tested and practical, not theoretical,\" or \"His genuine obsession with understanding how things work—combined with zero tolerance for marketing fluff—makes his assessments feel refreshingly honest.\")",

We're creating scripts for videos that look like someone just opened their camera app and started talking because they had to share something right now.\n\nThe Golden Rule: If it feels intentional, it's wrong. If it feels polished, it's wrong. If it looks like advertising, it's wrong.\n\nThe Raw iPhone Reality\n✅ EMBRACE THESE ELEMENTS:\nCamera Behavior:\n\nHandheld shake and natural drift (people don't have steady hands)\nMid-video adjustments: sudden zooms, focus shifts, reframing\nPhone wobble from talking/gesturing/breathing\nOne-handed filming while other hand interacts with product\nAccidental tilts when attention shifts\nCamera drop/rise as arm gets tired\nVertical video (99% of the time - it's a phone)\nEnvironmental Truth:\n\nReal locations: unmade bed visible, dishes in sink, car dashboard clutter, bathroom counter chaos\nActual lighting: harsh overhead, window glare, lamp warmth, shadow inconsistencies\nBackground life: roommate sounds, TV murmur, street noise, pet appearances, notifications pinging\nNatural mess: laundry pile, scattered makeup, coffee cup in frame\nHuman Imperfections:\n\nFinger briefly covering lens corner\nFace cut off at top of frame temporarily\nProduct slipping in grip and readjusting\nLooking away to check what they're doing\nMid-sentence \"wait\" moments\nForgetting what they were saying and recovering\nNatural facial expressions (not camera-ready smiles)\nAudio Reality:\n\nRoom echo (bathroom tile bounce, bedroom fabric absorption)\nSlight distortion when excited/loud\nBackground ambient noise (fridge hum, AC, traffic)\nNatural breathing between thoughts\nVoice getting quieter when focused on demonstration\nSlight audio pop when moving phone quickly\n❌ ABSOLUTELY AVOID:\nText overlays, captions, stickers, graphics (ZERO on-screen elements)\nTripod stability or locked-down angles\nConsistent perfect framing throughout\nProfessional lighting setups or ring lights\nClean, styled backgrounds (no \"content corner\")\nScripted delivery cadence or brand language\nMultiple clean takes edited together\nTransitions, effects, or filters\nStrategic product placement (it should feel incidental)\n\"Content creator\" energy (avoid the performance of authenticity)\nThe 12-Second Structure (Flexible Framework)\nThis is a guide, not a rule. Real moments don't follow perfect timing.\n\nSECONDS 0-2: Immediate Entry\n\nStart mid-thought, mid-action, or mid-discovery\nCamera still finding the angle\nHook is situational, not manufactured\nExamples: \"Okay wait—\" / \"So I just tried—\" / \"This is insane\"\nSECONDS 2-9: Natural Demonstration\n\nShowing product while talking (not posed showing)\nCamera adjusts as hands move\nMain benefit emerges organically through use\nVerbal reaction happens in real-time\nCan include pauses, \"um\"s, self-corrections\nSECONDS 9-12: Casual Conclusion\n\nThought wraps up (might be mid-sentence at cutoff)\nProduct remains visible but not forced\nCan trail off naturally or end abruptly\nNo call-to-action feel, just personal opinion\nCritical: Final word must hit before/at 12-second mark\nScript Inputs (Use Exactly As Provided)\nProduct Image: First image in conversation\nCreator Profile: {{ $node['Persona Prompt Setup'].json.prompt }}\nProduct Name: {{ $node['form_trigger'].json['Product Name'] }}\n\nInput Rules:\nUse ONLY the exact product name provided (no invented brand speak)\nReference ONLY what's visible in the product image\nStay within the creator profile characteristics given\nDo NOT fabricate slogans, taglines, or marketing copy\nStick to observable product features and realistic use cases\nOutput Format: 3 Distinct Script Variations\nCreate three different authentic approaches to the same product:\n\nExcited Discovery - Just found it, can't wait to share\nCasual Recommendation - Talking like texting a friend\nIn-the-Moment Demo - Showing while actively using\nScript Template Structure\nFor each of the 3 scripts, use this exact format:\n\n\n---\nSCRIPT [1/2/3]: [Approach name - 3-5 words describing the vibe]\n\nTHE ENERGY: [One specific descriptor - examples: \"Caffeinated morning ramble\" / \"Half-asleep bathroom whisper\" / \"Can't believe this worked\" excitement / \"Chill bedtime chat\" / \"Running late but had to film\"]\n\nDIALOGUE WITH TIMESTAMPS:\n[0:00-0:02] \"[Opening - 3-6 words max, feels mid-conversation]\"\n[0:02-0:09] \"[Main content - 18-28 words total.

I don't know, just really good\"\nCorrections: \"It took like five minutes—okay maybe ten—but still\"\nVerbal Pacing Indicators:\n\nCommas = brief pause\nEllipsis (...) = longer pause/thinking\nEm-dash (—) = self-correction or interruption\nFast sections = excitement/enthusiasm\nSlow sections = demonstrating/focusing\nRegional/Personal Speech:\n\nIf creator profile indicates region, add appropriate: \"y'all\" / \"hella\" / \"wicked\" / \"mad\" / etc.\nGen Z markers: \"no because\" / \"the way that\" / \"not me\" / \"wait\" as emphasis\nMillennial markers: \"I'm obsessed\" / \"I'm dead\" / \"I cannot\"\nVisual Authenticity Markers\nCamera \"Mistakes\":\n\nFinger edge briefly in frame corner (1-2 seconds)\nLens flare from window/light source\nFocus hunting (sharp → blur → sharp) when switching between face and product\nSlight overexposure recovery when moving near window\nUnderexposure in corners when face-focused with backlight\nReal Life Interruptions:\n\nPet walking through frame\nRoommate door opening in background\nPhone notification banner briefly appearing\nSomeone calling out from another room\nDelivery knock/doorbell (reaction but continuing)\nSomething falling over off-screen (glance but recovery)\nNatural Product Handling:\n\nProduct slips, readjust grip\nTwo-hand open requires phone reposition\nPump/squeeze awkward with one hand\nSetting down isn't perfectly placed\nPicking back up means brief off-screen moment\nCap rolling off counter (optional chaos)\nPhysical Tells:\n\nHand shake increase when gesturing emphatically\nArm fatigue drop (phone slowly lowers from starting position)\nBlink rate increases when concentrating on demo\nHair falling in face, pushed away with wrist (not free hand)\nShifting weight = frame sway\nLeaning closer to show detail = temporary face cut-off\nTiming Authenticity\nPacing Realities:\n\n0-2 seconds often feels FAST (jumping right in)\n3-7 seconds can slow down (demonstration focus)\n8-10 speeds up slightly (wrapping up thought)\n11-12 might feel rushed (fitting in last point)\nNatural Breath Patterns:\n\nInhale before starting = slight pause at 0:00\nQuick breath between thoughts = marked with comma\nDeep breath before demonstration = \"Okay so...\"\nExhale laugh at end = audio trails off\nThe 12-Second Hard Stop:\n\nSentence CAN be incomplete at cutoff (feels more real)\nLast word can stretch into the cut \"...sooo—\"\nCan end on upward inflection (like asking question)\nCan end mid-laugh or mid-word\nBUT key message must be delivered by 11 seconds\nThe Three Script Approaches Explained\nSCRIPT 1: Excited Discovery\nEmotional Core: Just found this, mind blown, have to tell everyone right now\n\nEnergy Examples:\n\n\"Can't believe I found this\" enthusiasm\n\"Where has this been my whole life\" revelation\n\"Running to camera\" urgency\n\"This is insane\" rapid-fire excitement\nCharacteristics:\n\nFaster talking pace\nMore hand gestures (= more camera shake)\nLots of emphasis words: \"so good\" / \"literally\" / \"I'm obsessed\"\nMight start mid-action (already applying/using)\nLess structured thought = more authentic rambling\nCould repeat themselves in excitement\nCamera Behavior:\n\nMore erratic movement (enthusiasm = less control)\nZooming in accidentally when gesturing\nMight flip camera to show something then back to face\nProduct handling rushed/less precise\nSCRIPT 2: Casual Recommendation\nEmotional Core: Friend-to-friend advice, chill sharing, no pressure\n\nEnergy Examples:\n\n\"Bedtime chat\" relaxed\n\"Morning coffee vibe\" easy-going\n\"Just FYI this exists\" matter-of-fact\n\"Low-key obsessed\" understated enthusiasm\nCharacteristics:\n\nSlower, more measured pace\nConversational tone like texting out loud\n\"So I've been using...\" narrative structure\nCould include mini-story context\nMore pauses for natural thought flow\nRecommendations feel personal, not pushy\nCamera Behavior:\n\nSteadier hold (less excited energy)\nComfortable, settled position\nSmooth demonstrations (taking time)\nMight prop phone to use both hands\nFeels like they're in no rush\nSCRIPT 3: In-the-Moment Demo\nEmotional Core: Active use while filming, real-time reaction, showing not telling\n\nEnergy Examples:\n\n\"Getting ready and filming it\" multitask\n\"Trying this for the first time\" genuine discovery\n\"Morning routine capture\" incidental filming\n\"Problem-solving on camera\" authentic process\nCharacteristics:\n\nMore focus on showing than explaining\nShorter verbal sections, more visual demonstration\nReal-time reaction/commentary\n\"Okay wait watch this\" demo energy\nCould have longer pauses during application\nAction-focused = less scripted speech\nCamera Behavior:\n\nOne-handed filming majority of time\nCamera adjusts to follow action (not posed)\nMight set down phone to use both hands\nPerspective shifts (close for detail, back for context)\nLess eye contact (focused on task)\nQuality Control Checklist\nBefore finalizing scripts, verify:\n\n No text overlays mentioned anywhere\n All dialogue completes by 12-second mark\n Product name used exactly as provided (no creative additions)\n Only product features visible in image are referenced\n Creator profile characteristics are reflected\n Camera shake/movement described throughout\n Real location details included (not generic \"background\")\n Natural speech patterns (fillers, pauses, corrections)\n Product interaction feels necessary, not forced\n At least 2-3 \"imperfection moments\" per script\n Lighting specified with realistic sources\n Audio environment detailed\n Ending feels natural (not manufactured conclusion)\n Each second has specific camera + creator + product details\n No \"professional\" language or marketing speak\n Three scripts feel distinctly different from each other\nFinal Notes on Execution\nRemember:\n\nReal people don't think about cinematography while filming\nAuthentic UGC feels effortless because it is\nThe best scripts read like transcriptions of actual videos\nImperfection IS the perfection here\nWhen in doubt, make it messier, not cleaner\nThe goal is not to look authentic, but to be authentic\nThe Ultimate Test:\nIf someone saw this video in their feed, would they scroll past thinking \"ad\" or stop because it feels like genuine content from someone they could know?\n\nIf it's the latter, you've succeeded.\n\nGenerate 3 complete scripts now using all inputs provided."

The process starts when the user submits a form with product name, idea or image. n8n first prepares the data, builds the brand or persona context, then asks AI to create detailed video prompts. These prompts are passed to Sora 2 to produce short realistic videos.\n\nIt follows a clear sequence: initial setup, prompt creation, image frame generation, and final video rendering. Each stage can be customized for different brands, niches or voice styles. Everything runs inside n8n, so there is no need for external editing tools.\n\n## Setup steps\n1. Create your OpenAI and Sora 2 API keys and add them in n8n credentials.  \n2. Connect the Form Trigger or Webhook to collect input from users.  \n3. Adjust prompt text inside “Persona Prompt Setup” node.  \n4. Test one sample run to confirm video generation and file upload.  \n5. After testing, turn on workflow to run automatically.\n"
