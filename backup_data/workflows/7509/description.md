This n8n workflow automates the creation of high-quality, SEO-optimized blog posts using AI. It pulls keyword data from Google Sheets, conducts research via Perplexity AI, generates structured content (title, introduction, key takeaways, body, conclusion, and FAQs) with OpenAI and Anthropic models, assembles the post, performs final edits, converts to HTML, and publishes directly to WordPress. Ideal for content marketers, bloggers, or agencies looking to scale content production while maintaining relevance and engagement.
