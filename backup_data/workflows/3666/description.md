How It Works
- 
This workflow automates the entire property lead generation process in a few simple steps:

1. Property Search: Connects to BatchData's Property Search API with customizable parameters (location, property type, value range, equity percentage, etc.)
2. Lead Filtering & Scoring: Processes results to identify the most promising leads based on criteria like absentee ownership, years owned, equity percentage, and tax status. Each property receives a lead score to prioritize follow-up.
3. Skip Tracing: Automatically retrieves owner contact information (phone, email, mailing address) for each qualified property.
4. Data Formatting: Structures all property and owner data into a clean, organized format ready for your systems.
5. Multi-Channel Output:
- Generates an Excel spreadsheet with all lead details
- Pushes leads directly to your CRM (configurable for HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Sends a summary email with the spreadsheet attached



The workflow can run on a daily schedule or be triggered manually as needed. All parameters are easily configurable through dedicated nodes, requiring no coding knowledge.
