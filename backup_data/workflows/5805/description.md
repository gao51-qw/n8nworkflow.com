The process is as follows:

1.  **Receive URL**: A Telegram bot receives a YouTube video URL from a user.
2.  **Get Transcript**: It uses the community node **`n8n-nodes-supadata`** to retrieve the video's transcript via the Supadata service.
3.  **Generate Script**: Based on the retrieved transcript, Google Gemini creates a script (title and body) optimized for a YouTube Shorts video.
4.  **Send Result**: The generated script is sent back to the user who sent the original URL via Telegram.

## **How to Use**

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Install the `n8n-nodes-supadata` community node as described below.
    *   Register your API keys for Telegram, Supadata, and Google Gemini as credentials in n8n.
    *   Set the appropriate credentials in each node within the workflow.
    *   For Telegram, create your bot with BotFarther.

2.  **Execution**:
    *   Activate the workflow.
    *   Send a YouTube video URL to your configured Telegram bot.
3.  **Confirmation**:
    *   After a short while, the workflow will run automatically, and you will receive the completed script from the Telegram bot.
