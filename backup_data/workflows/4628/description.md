This is a simple temlate that will allow you to customise the notifications in Radarr, Sonarr, Bazarr and similar. By default the notifications are configured to be sent to discord and look similar to the default ones but are just minimalistic.

All you need to configure is in your Radarr etc. instances to have Webhook notification type and here point to your Discord channel webhook.
