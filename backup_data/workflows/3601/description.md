# Scrape Indeed Job Listings for Hiring Signals Using Bright Data and LLMs

## How the flow runs
1. Fill the form with job position you're hunting for.
2. Bright data's scraper will scrape Indeed based on your requirments.  
3. Workflow waits for the snapshot.  
4. Data returns as JSON.  
5. Jobs append to Google Sheets.  
6. Each row goes to an LLM to analyze if you're a good fit for the job (based on your prompts).  
7. The LLMswrites **YES** or **NO** next to each job opportunity, helping you find job posts that are relevant to you.

## What you need
- Google Sheets with our template.  
- Bright Data dataset and API key.  
- OpenAI key for GPT‑4o mini (or any other LLM).

## Form fields To Fill

- **Keyword** – role or skills.  
- **Country** – two‑letter code.

## Setup steps
1. Copy the sheet template link.  
2. Import the JSON workflow. 
3. Add your credentials in nodes.  
4. Test the form manually.  
5. Add a schedule if desired.
