  "description": "## 🛡 CyberScan – AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner with Nessus, OpenAI, and Google Sheets\n\n### 👤 Who’s it for\n\nSecurity teams, DevOps engineers, vulnerability analysts, and automation builders who want to eliminate repetitive Nessus scan parsing, AI-based risk triage, and manual reporting. Designed for orgs following NIST CSF or CISA KEV compliance guidelines.\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ How it works / What it does\n\n- Runs scheduled or manual scans via the Nessus API.\n- Processes scan results and extracts asset + vulnerability data.\n- Uses a custom AI-based risk metric (LEV) to triage findings into:\n  - 🚨 Expert review\n  - ✅ Self-healing\n  - 🕵️ Monitoring\n- Automatically sends email alerts for critical CVEs.\n- Exports daily summaries to Google Sheets (or your own BI system).\n- Maps to NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).\n\n---\n\n### 🧰 How to set up\n\n1. **Nessus**: Add your Nessus API credentials and instance URL.\n2. **Google Sheets**: Authenticate your Google account.\n3. **OpenAI / LLM**: Use your API key if adding LLM triage or rewrite prompts.\n4. **Email**: Update SMTP credentials and alert recipient address.\n5. **Set your targets**: Adjust asset ranges or scan UUIDs as needed.\n6. ⚠️ All setup steps are explained in sticky notes inside the workflow.\n\n---\n\n### 📋 Requirements\n\n- Nessus Essentials (Free) or Nessus Pro with API access.\n- SMTP service (e.g. Gmail, Mailgun, SendGrid).\n- Google Sheets OAuth2 credentials.\n- Optional: OpenAI or other LLM provider for LEV scoring and CVE insights.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠 How to customize the workflow\n\n- Swap **Google Sheets** with Airtable, Supabase, or PostgreSQL.\n- Change scan logic or asset list to fit your internal network scope.\n- Adjust AI scoring logic to match internal CVSS thresholds or KEV tags.\n- Expand alerting logic to include Slack, Discord, or webhook triggers.\n\n---\n\n🔒 **No sensitive data included. All credentials and sheet links are placeholders.**\n\n\n",
