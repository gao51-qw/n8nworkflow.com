  "description": "This workflow automates the process of receiving vendor quotations, extracting and summarizing their contents using **AI**, and logging the results for comparison. The system listens for new file uploads via **webhook**, processes each file using a **summarization engine**, and generates a well-formatted **summary table** that is stored in **Google Sheets** and sent via **email** to stakeholders.\n\n## **Good to Know**\n\n* **Saves hours of manual work** by auto-comparing multiple vendor quotations.\n* **Uses AI summarization** to intelligently identify highlights and differences in each quote.\n* **Supports structured summaries** for quick stakeholder decision-making.\n* **Maintains a Google Sheets log** for historical comparison and auditing.\n* **Email notifications** ensure stakeholders receive real-time updates.\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n### **1. Upload Quotes**\n\n**Webhook trigger** that listens for uploaded vendor quotation files (PDF, Excel, or Docs).\n\n### **2. Extract File Data**\n\n**Parses the uploaded file** and extracts relevant quote data (price, items, vendor name, etc.).\n\n### **3. AI Summarization**\n\n**Sends extracted data to an AI API (Grok)** to generate a human-readable comparison summary.\n\n### **4. Wait For Reply**\n\n**Pauses the workflow** until the AI response is fully received.\n\n### **5. Format Summary**\n\n**Formats the AI-generated content** into a structured summary (e.g., table format or comparison bullets).\n\n### **6. Log to Google Sheets**\n\n**Appends the formatted summary** to a Google Sheet for tracking and reference.\n\n### **7. Send Email**\n\n**Emails the summary** to predefined recipients (procurement, finance, etc.).\n\n## **Data Sources**\n\n* **Uploaded Vendor Quotation Files** – Typically in PDF, DOCX, or Excel format containing vendor proposals.\n* **AI API (Grok)** – Processes the quote data and returns a summarized comparison.\n\n## **How to Use**\n\n1. **Import the workflow** into your n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).\n2. **Configure the Webhook URL** to receive file uploads.\n3. **Set up file extraction logic** in the “Extract File Data” node to match your file format.\n4. **Configure your Grok API credentials** in the “AI Summarization” node.\n5. **Connect your Google Sheets account** to the “Log to Google Sheets” node.\n6. **Customize the recipient email address** in the “Send Email” node.\n7. **Test with sample quotation files** to validate the entire flow.\n\n## **Requirements**\n\n* **Self-hosted n8n instance** (if using community nodes).\n* **API key for Grok** or another AI summarization service.\n* **Google account access** to log summary data to Sheets.\n* **Mail credentials** for sending automated emails (SMTP setup).\n* **File parsing logic** (for PDFs, DOCX, Excel) depending on your vendor formats.\n\n## **Customizing This Workflow**\n\n* **Modify the Extract File Data node** to support additional quote formats or fields.\n* **Enhance AI Summarization** with custom prompts or models for industry-specific terms.\n* **Format output into a PDF summary** or comparison chart if needed.\n* **Add Slack/Teams integration** for real-time team alerts.\n* **Apply filters** to compare only specific vendors or line items.\n\n\n\n",
