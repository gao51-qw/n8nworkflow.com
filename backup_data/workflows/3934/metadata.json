  "description": "### Who is this for?\nJira users who want to ****automate**** the generation of a **Lessons Learned** or **Retrospective** report after an Epic is Done.\n\n### What problem is this workflow solving? / use case\nLessons Learned / Retrospective reports are often omitted in Agile teams because they take time to write. With the use of n8n and AI this process can be automated.\n\n### What is this workflow doing\n- Triggers automatically upon an Epic reaching the \"Done\" status in Jira.\n- Collects all related tasks and comments associated with the completed Epic.\n- Intelligently filters the gathered data to provide the LLM with the most relevant information.\n- Utilizes an LLM with a structured System Message to generate insightful reports.\n- Delivers the finalized report directly to your specified Google Docs document.\n\n### Setup\n1. Create a Jira API key and follow the Credentials Setup in the Jira trigger node.\n2. Create credentials for Google Docs and paste your document ID into the Node.\n\n### How to customize this workflow to your needs\n- Change the System Message in the AI Agent to fit your needs.",
