  "description": "## 🎯 Accounting Alerts Automation\n\n**Purpose:** Automatically track Companies House filing deadlines for UK accounting firms and prevent costly penalties (£150-£1,500 per missed deadline).\n\n**How it works:**\n- Daily automated checks pull live deadline data from Companies House API\n- Color-coded email alerts (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green) prioritize urgent deadlines\n- Interactive \"Yes/No\" buttons let recipients confirm completion status\n- All data syncs back to Google Sheets for complete audit trail\n\n**Value:** Saves 2-3 hours/week per firm while eliminating manual tracking errors.\n\n## ⚙️ Daily Deadline Check & Alert System\n\n**Runs:** Every weekday at 5 PM (Mon-Fri)\n\n**What happens:**\n1. **Read Company Database** - Fetches all tracked companies from Google Sheets\n2. **Get Company Data** - Pulls live filing deadlines from Companies House API for each company\n3. **Update Due Dates** - Syncs latest deadline data back to the tracking sheet\n4. **Build Interactive Email** - Creates HTML email with:\n   - Color-coded urgency indicators (days remaining)\n   - Sortable table by due date\n   - Clickable Yes/No confirmation buttons for each company\n5. **Send via Gmail** - Delivers consolidated report to accounting team\n\n**Why automated:** Manual deadline checking across 10-50+ companies is time-consuming and error-prone. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks.\n\n\n## ✅ Email Response Handler (Webhook Flow)\n\n**Triggered when:** Recipient clicks \"Yes\" or \"No\" button in the alert email\n\n**What happens:**\n1. **Webhook** - Receives confirmation status (company_number, company_name, yes/no)\n2. **Process Data** - Extracts response details from the webhook payload\n3. **Update Sheet** - Records confirmation status in Google Sheets with timestamp\n4. **Confirmation Page** - Displays success message to user\n\n**Why this matters:** Provides instant feedback to the user and creates an audit trail of who confirmed what and when. No separate tracking system needed—everything updates automatically in the same spreadsheet.\n\n**Result:** Accountability without administrative burden.\n\n## 📋 Setup Requirements\n\n**Google Sheets Database Structure:**\nCreate a sheet with these columns:\n- company_number (manually entered)\n- company_name (manually entered)  \n- accounts_due (auto-updated)\n- confirmation_due (auto-updated)\n- confirmation_submitted (updated via email clicks)\n- last_updated (auto-timestamp)\n\n**Required Credentials:**\n- Google Sheets OAuth (for reading/writing data)\n- Companies House API key (free from api.company-information.service.gov.uk)\n- Gmail OAuth (for sending alerts)\n\n**Webhook Configuration:**\nUpdate webhook URL in \"Build Interactive Email\" node to match your n8n instance.\n\n**Time to Setup:** ~15 minutes once credentials are configured.",
