  "description": "**Automate video transcription and Q&A with async VLM processing that scales from short clips to long recordings.**\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1. **Monitors Google Drive** for new files in a specific folder and grabs the file ID on create\n2. **Automatically downloads** the binary to hand off for processing\n3. **Sends the video to VLM Run** for **async transcription** with a callback URL that posts results back to n8n\n4. **Receives the transcript JSON via Webhook** and **appends a row in Google Sheets** with the video identifier and transcript data\n5. **Enables chat Q&A** through the **Chat Trigger + AI Agent**. The agent fetches relevant rows from Sheets and answers only from those segments using the connected chat model\n\n## Setup\n\n**Prerequisites:** Google Drive and Google Sheets accounts, VLM Run API credentials, OpenAI (or another supported) chat model credentials, n8n instance.\n\nInstall the verified **VLM Run node** by searching for **VLM Run** in the nodes list, then click **Install**. You can also confirm on npm if needed. After install, it integrates directly for robust async transcription.\n\n**Quick Setup:**\n\n1. **Google Drive folder watch**\n\n   * Add **Google Drive Trigger** and choose **Specific folder**. Set polling to every minute, event to **File Created**. Connect Drive OAuth2.\n\n2. **Download the new file**\n\n   * Add **Google Drive** node with **Download**. Map `{{$json.id}}` and save the binary as `data`.\n\n3. **Async transcription with VLM Run**\n\n   * Add **VLM Run** node. Operation: **video**. Domain: `video.transcription`. Enable **Process Asynchronously** and set **Callback URL** to your Webhook path (for example `/transcript-video`). Add your VLM Run API key.\n\n4. **Webhook to receive results**\n\n   * Add **Webhook** node with method **POST** and path `/transcript-video`. This is the endpoint VLM Run calls when the job completes. Use **When Last Node Finishes** or respond via a Respond node if you prefer. \n\n5. **Append to Google Sheets**\n\n   * Add **Google Sheets** node with **Append**. Point to your spreadsheet and sheet. Map:\n\n     * **Video Name** → the video identifier from the webhook payload\n     * **Data** → the transcript text or JSON from the webhook payload\n   * Connect Google Sheets OAuth2.\n\n6. **Chat entry point and Agent**\n\n   * Add **Chat Trigger** to receive user questions.\n   * Add **AI Agent** and connect:\n\n     * a **Chat Model** (for example OpenAI Chat Model)\n     * the **Google Sheets Tool** to read relevant rows\n   * In the Agent system message, instruct:\n\n     * Use the Sheets tool to fetch transcript rows matching the question\n     * Answer **only** from those rows\n     * Cite or reference row context as needed\n\n7. **Test and activate**\n\n   * Upload a sample video to the watched Drive folder.\n   * Wait for the callback to populate your sheet.\n   * Ask a question through the Chat Trigger and confirm the agent quotes only from the retrieved rows.\n   * Activate your template and let it automate the task.\n\n## How to take this further\n\n* **Team memory:** Ask “What did we decide on pricing last week?” and get the exact clip and answer.\n* **Study helper:** Drop classes in, then ask for key points or formulas by topic.\n* **Customer FAQ builder:** Turn real support calls into answers your team can reuse.\n* **Podcast highlights:** Find quotes, tips, and standout moments from each episode.\n* **Meeting catch-up:** Get decisions and action items from any recording, fast.\n* **Marketing snippets:** Pull short, social-ready lines from long demos or webinars.\n* **Team learning hub:** Grow a searchable video brain that remembers everything.\n\n\n\nThis workflow uses the **VLM Run node for scalable, async video transcription** and the **AI Agent for grounded Q&A from Sheets**, giving you a durable pipeline from upload to searchable answers with minimal upkeep.",
