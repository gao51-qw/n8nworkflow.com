### **n8n Workflow: Automate SIEM Alert Enrichment with MITRE ATT&CK & Qdrant**  

---

## **Who is this for?**  
This workflow is ideal for:  
- **Cybersecurity teams & SOC analysts** who want to automate **SIEM alert enrichment**.  
- **IT security professionals** looking to integrate **MITRE ATT&CK intelligence** into their ticketing system.  
- **Organizations using Zendesk for security incidents** who need enhanced **contextual threat data**.  
- **Anyone using n8n and Qdrant** to build **AI-powered security workflows**.  

---

## **What problem does this workflow solve?**  
Security teams receive **large volumes of raw SIEM alerts** that lack actionable context. Investigating every alert manually is **time-consuming** and can lead to **delayed response times**. This workflow solves this problem by:  
✔ **Automatically enriching SIEM alerts** with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.  
✔ **Tagging & classifying alerts** based on known attack techniques.  
✔ **Providing remediation steps** to guide the response team.  
✔ **Enhancing security tickets in Zendesk** with relevant threat intelligence.

## **What this workflow does**  

1️⃣ **Ingests SIEM alerts** (via chatbot or ticketing system like Zendesk).  
2️⃣ **Queries a Qdrant vector store** containing MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  
3️⃣ **Extracts relevant TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, & Procedures)** from the alert.  
4️⃣ **Generates remediation steps** using AI-powered enrichment.  
5️⃣ **Updates Zendesk tickets** with threat intelligence & recommended actions.  
6️⃣ **Provides structured alert data** for further automation or reporting.

### **Steps to Set Up**  

1️⃣ **Embed MITRE ATT&CK data into Qdrant**  
   - This workflow pulls MITRE ATT&CK data from **Google Drive** and **loads it into Qdrant**.  
   - The data is **vectorized using OpenAI embeddings** for fast retrieval.  

2️⃣ **Deploy the n8n Chatbot**  
   - The chatbot listens for **SIEM alerts** and sends them to the AI processing pipeline.  
   - Alerts are **analyzed using an AI agent trained on MITRE ATT&CK**.  

3️⃣ **Enrich Zendesk Tickets**  
   - The workflow extracts **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** from alerts.  
   - It **updates Zendesk tickets with contextual threat intelligence**.  
   - The **remediation steps are included as internal notes** for SOC teams.
