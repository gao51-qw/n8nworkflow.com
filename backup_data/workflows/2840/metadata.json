  "description": "### **n8n Workflow: Automate SIEM Alert Enrichment with MITRE ATT&CK & Qdrant**  \n\n---\n\n## **Who is this for?**  \nThis workflow is ideal for:  \n- **Cybersecurity teams & SOC analysts** who want to automate **SIEM alert enrichment**.  \n- **IT security professionals** looking to integrate **MITRE ATT&CK intelligence** into their ticketing system.  \n- **Organizations using Zendesk for security incidents** who need enhanced **contextual threat data**.  \n- **Anyone using n8n and Qdrant** to build **AI-powered security workflows**.  \n\n---\n\n## **What problem does this workflow solve?**  \nSecurity teams receive **large volumes of raw SIEM alerts** that lack actionable context. Investigating every alert manually is **time-consuming** and can lead to **delayed response times**. This workflow solves this problem by:  \n✔ **Automatically enriching SIEM alerts** with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.  \n✔ **Tagging & classifying alerts** based on known attack techniques.  \n✔ **Providing remediation steps** to guide the response team.  \n✔ **Enhancing security tickets in Zendesk** with relevant threat intelligence.  \n\n---\n\n## **What this workflow does**  \n\n1️⃣ **Ingests SIEM alerts** (via chatbot or ticketing system like Zendesk).  \n2️⃣ **Queries a Qdrant vector store** containing MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  \n3️⃣ **Extracts relevant TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, & Procedures)** from the alert.  \n4️⃣ **Generates remediation steps** using AI-powered enrichment.  \n5️⃣ **Updates Zendesk tickets** with threat intelligence & recommended actions.  \n6️⃣ **Provides structured alert data** for further automation or reporting.  \n\n---\n\n## **Setup Guide**  \n\n### **Prerequisites**  \n- **n8n instance** (Cloud or Self-hosted).  \n- **Qdrant vector store** with MITRE ATT&CK data embedded.  \n- **OpenAI API key** (for AI-based threat processing).  \n- **Zendesk account** (for ticket enrichment, if applicable).  \n- [Clean Mitre Data Python Script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yxv5fDdQ2OigYhhfv_WqGb9QTr-Q_aeW/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Cleaned Mitre Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kt6ZJ4DYvNm44I9fBKvmXjeHQqLJqCwA/view?usp=drive_link)\n- [Full Mitre Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lq7v3luu3DC44Tdn2DIxiVwnh3UQWM_Y/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n### **Steps to Set Up**  \n\n1️⃣ **Embed MITRE ATT&CK data into Qdrant**  \n   - This workflow pulls MITRE ATT&CK data from **Google Drive** and **loads it into Qdrant**.  \n   - The data is **vectorized using OpenAI embeddings** for fast retrieval.  \n\n2️⃣ **Deploy the n8n Chatbot**  \n   - The chatbot listens for **SIEM alerts** and sends them to the AI processing pipeline.  \n   - Alerts are **analyzed using an AI agent trained on MITRE ATT&CK**.  \n\n3️⃣ **Enrich Zendesk Tickets**  \n   - The workflow extracts **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** from alerts.  \n   - It **updates Zendesk tickets with contextual threat intelligence**.  \n   - The **remediation steps are included as internal notes** for SOC teams.  \n\n---\n\n## **How to Customize This Workflow**  \n\n🔧 **Modify the chatbot trigger**: Adapt the chatbot node to receive alerts from **Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any other tool**.  \n\n🔧 **Change the SIEM input source**: Connect your workflow to **Splunk, Elastic SIEM, or Chronicle Security**.  \n\n🔧 **Customize remediation steps**: Use a **custom AI model** to tailor remediation responses based on **organization-specific security policies**.  \n\n🔧 **Extend ticketing integration**: Modify the Zendesk node to also work with **Jira, ServiceNow, or another ITSM platform**.  \n\n---\n\n## **Why This Workflow is Powerful**  \n✅ **Saves time**: Automates **alert triage & classification**.  \n✅ **Improves security posture**: Helps **SOC teams act faster** on threats.  \n✅ **Leverages AI & vector search**: Uses **LLM-powered enrichment** for **real-time context**.  \n✅ **Works across platforms**: Supports **n8n Cloud, Self-hosted, and Qdrant**.  \n\n---\n\n## **🚀 Get Started Now!**  \n📖 [Watch the Setup Video](https://youtu.be/SbWrCe0R9LE)  \n💬 **Have Questions?
