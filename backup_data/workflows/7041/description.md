## Telegram Voice Message → Automatic Email

![baptistefortn8nautomationtelegramaudio.png](fileId:1951)

**Imagine:** What if you could turn a simple Telegram voice message into a professional email—without typing, copying, pasting, or even opening Gmail?

This workflow does it all for you: just record a voice note, and it will transcribe, format, and write a clean HTML email, **then send it to the right person—all by itself.**

## Prerequisites

- **Create a Telegram bot** (via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)) and get the token.
- **Have an OpenAI account** (API key for Whisper and GPT-4).
- **Set up a Gmail account with OAuth2.**
- **Import the JSON template** into your automation platform.

## 🧩 Detailed Flow Architecture

### 1. Telegram Trigger

![workflown8ntelegramvoicebaptistefort.png](fileId:1953)

**Node:** Telegram Trigger  
This node listens to all **Message** events received by the specified bot (e.g., “BOT OFFICIEL BAPTISTE”).  
Whenever a user sends a voice message, the trigger fires automatically.

&gt; ⚠️ Only one Telegram trigger per bot is possible (API limitation).

**Key parameter:**  
- `Trigger On`: Message

### 2. Wait

**Node:** Wait  
Used to buffer or smooth out calls to avoid collisions if you receive several voice messages in a row.

### 3. Retrieve the Audio File

**Node:** Get a file  
- **Type:** Telegram (resource: `file`)
- **Parameter:**  
  - `fileId = {{$json["message"]["voice"]["file_id"]}}`  
This node fetches the voice file from Telegram received in step 1

### 4. Automatic Transcription (Whisper)

**Node:** Transcribe a recording  
- **Resource:** audio  
- **Operation:** transcribe  
- **API Key:** Your OpenAI account  
The audio file is sent to OpenAI Whisper: the output is clean, accurate text ready to be processed.

### 5. Optional Wait (Wait1)

**Node:** Wait1  
Same purpose as step 2: useful if you want to buffer or add a delay to absorb processing time.

### 6. Structured Email Generation (GPT-4 + Output Parser)

**Node:** AI Agent  
This is the core of the flow:

- The transcribed text is sent to GPT-4 (or GPT-4.1-mini here, via OpenAI Chat Model)
- **Prompt used:**

    ```markdown
    You are an assistant specialized in writing professional emails.

    Based on the text below, you must: {{ $json.text }}

    1. Detect if there is a recipient's email address in the text (or something similar like "send to fort.baptiste.pro")
       - If it’s not a complete address, complete it by assuming it ends with `@gmail.com`.
    2. Understand the user's intent (resignation, refusal, application, excuse, request, etc.)
    3. Generate a relevant and concise email subject, faithful to the content
    4. Write a professional message, structured in HTML:
       - With a polite tone, adapted to the situation
       - Formatted with HTML tags (`<p>`, `<br>`, etc.)
       - No spelling mistakes in French
       - My first name is jeremy and if the text says he is not happy, specify the wish to resign

⚠️ You must always return your answer in the following strict JSON format, with no extra text:
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "email": "adresse@gmail.com",
      "subject": "Objet de l’email",
      "body": "<p>Contenu HTML de l’email</p>"
    }
    ```

Everything is strictly validated and formatted with the **Structured Output Parser** node.

### 7. Automatic Email Sending (Gmail)

**Node:** Send a message  
- **To:** `{{$json.output.email}}`
- **Subject:** `{{$json.output.subject}}`
- **HTML Body:** `{{$json.output.body}}`  
This node takes the JSON structure returned by the AI and sends the email via Gmail, to the right recipient, with the correct subject and full HTML formatting.
