# Switch between work and personal contexts with GPT-4.1 and iPhone automation

> ## Purpose
The purpose of this automation is to help context switch from office to some side projects or passion gigs so you can be free of distracting thoughts and re-set your perspective.

## Benefits

Anyone who works full time and also does something on the side (perhaps a side gig/being a mom/just follow your passion project)

## What you need
1. N8N (lol)
2. Any LLM API Key (I used OpenAI 4.1)
3. IPhone (automations and shortcuts)

## Template Setup 
1. Setup LLM API key.
2. Import template file to new workflow.
3. On Iphone create a new shortcut as per video. 
4. Create automation steps.
