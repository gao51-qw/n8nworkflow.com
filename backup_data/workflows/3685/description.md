## What This Workflow Does

This n8n workflow reads backlinks from a Google Sheet, sends each one to the DataForSEO On-Page API, and checks:

- Whether the backlink is still live on the target page
- Whether it's dofollow or nofollow
- Whether it's missing (i.e., lost)

The result is then written back to the same Google Sheet under a Status column.

## Your result will look like this:
