    "description": "# 🚀 **AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Automation**\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 **How It Works**\n\nThis workflow automatically generates LinkedIn posts based on a user-submitted topic, including both **content creation** and **image generation**, then publishes the post to LinkedIn. Ideal for marketers, content creators, or businesses looking to streamline their social media activity, without the need for manual post creation.\n\n**High-Level Workflow:**\n\n1. **Trigger**: The workflow is triggered when a user submits a form with a **topic** for the LinkedIn post.\n2. **Data Mapping**: The topic is mapped and prepared for the AI model.\n3. **AI Content Generation**: Calls the Google Gemini AI model to generate engaging post content and a visual image prompt.\n4. **Image Creation**: Sends the image prompt to the external API, **[gen-imager](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)**, to generate a professional image matching the topic.\n5. **Post Creation**: Publishes the **text** and **image** to LinkedIn, automatically updating the user's feed.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ **Set Up Steps (Quick Overview)**\n\n🕐 **Estimated Setup Time**: ~10–20 minutes\n\n1. **Connect Google Gemini**: Set up your Google Gemini API credentials to interact with the AI model for content creation.  \n2. **Set Up External Image API**: Configure the external image generation API ([gen-imager API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)) for visual creation based on the post prompt.\n3. **Connect LinkedIn**: Set up OAuth2 credentials to authenticate your LinkedIn account and allow publishing posts.\n4. **Form Submission Setup**: Create a simple web form for users to submit the topic for LinkedIn posts.\n5. **Activate the Workflow**: Once everything is connected, activate the workflow. It will trigger automatically upon receiving form submissions.\n\n💡 **Important Notes**:\n- The flow uses **Google Gemini (PaLM)** for generating content based on the user's topic.\n- **Text to Image**: The image generation process involves creating a professional, LinkedIn-appropriate image based on the post’s topic using the **[gen-imager API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)**.\n- You can customize the **visual elements** of the posts and adjust the tone of the generated content based on preferences.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 **Detailed Node Breakdown:**\n\n1. **On Form Submission**  \n   - **Trigger**: Captures the user-submitted topic and initializes the workflow.\n   - **Action**: Start the process by gathering the topic information.\n\n2. **Mapper (Field Mapping)**  \n   - **Action**: Maps the captured topic to a variable that is passed along for content generation.\n\n3. **AI Agent (Content Generation)**  \n   - **Action**: Calls Google Gemini to generate professional LinkedIn post content and an image prompt based on the submitted topic.\n   - **Key**: Outputs content in a structured form — post text and image prompt.\n\n4. **Google Gemini Chat Model**  \n   - **Action**: AI model that generates actionable insights, engaging copy, and an image prompt for LinkedIn post.\n\n5. **Normalizer (Data Cleanup)**  \n   - **Action**: Cleans the output from the AI model to ensure the content and image prompt are correctly formatted for use in the next steps.\n\n6. **Text to Image (Image Generation)**  \n   - **Action**: Sends the image prompt to the **[gen-imager API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)**, which returns a custom image based on the post's topic.\n\n7. **Decoder (Base64 Decoding)**  \n   - **Action**: Decodes the image from base64 format for easier uploading to LinkedIn.\n\n8. **LinkedIn (Post Creation)**  \n   - **Action**: Publishes the generated text and image to LinkedIn, automatically creating a polished post for the user’s feed.\n\n---\n\n## ⏱ **Execution Time Breakdown:**\n\n- **Total Estimated Execution Time**: ~15–40 seconds per workflow run.\n  - **On Form Submission**: Instant (Trigger)\n  - **Mapper (Field Mapping)**: ~1–2 seconds\n  - **AI Content Generation**: ~5–10 seconds (depending on server load)\n  - **Text to Image**: ~5–15 seconds (depends on external API)\n  - **LinkedIn Post Creation**: ~2–5 seconds\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 **Ready to Get Started?**\n\nLet’s get you started with automating your LinkedIn posts!  \nCreate your free n8n account and set up the workflow using this [**link**](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/7fuarh1e6dz5).\n\n---\n\n## 📝 **Notes & Customizations**  \n- **Form Fields**: Customize the form to gather more specific information for the LinkedIn posts (like audience targeting, post category, etc.).\n- **Image API Customization**: Adjust the image generation prompt to fit your brand’s style, or change the color palette as needed.\n- **Content Tone**: The tone can be adjusted by modifying the system message sent to Google Gemini for content generation.\n\n---\n",
