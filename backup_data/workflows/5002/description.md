# 🚀 **AI-Powered LinkedIn Post Automation**

---

## 🧩 **How It Works**

This workflow automatically generates LinkedIn posts based on a user-submitted topic, including both **content creation** and **image generation**, then publishes the post to LinkedIn. Ideal for marketers, content creators, or businesses looking to streamline their social media activity, without the need for manual post creation.

**High-Level Workflow:**

1. **Trigger**: The workflow is triggered when a user submits a form with a **topic** for the LinkedIn post.
2. **Data Mapping**: The topic is mapped and prepared for the AI model.
3. **AI Content Generation**: Calls the Google Gemini AI model to generate engaging post content and a visual image prompt.
4. **Image Creation**: Sends the image prompt to the external API, **[gen-imager](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)**, to generate a professional image matching the topic.
5. **Post Creation**: Publishes the **text** and **image** to LinkedIn, automatically updating the user's feed.

1. **Connect Google Gemini**: Set up your Google Gemini API credentials to interact with the AI model for content creation.  
2. **Set Up External Image API**: Configure the external image generation API ([gen-imager API](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/gen-imager)) for visual creation based on the post prompt.
