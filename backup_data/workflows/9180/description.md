## 🧩 Summary  
Easily digitize and organize your business cards!  
This workflow allows you to **upload a business card image**, automatically **extract contact information using Google Gemini’s OCR & vision model**, and **save the structured data into a Notion database** — no manual typing required.  

Perfect for teams or individuals who want to centralize client contact info in Notion after networking events or meetings.

## ⚙️ How it works  

1. **Form Submission**  
   - Upload a business card image (`.jpg`, `.png`, or `.jpeg`) through an n8n form.  
   - Optionally select a category (e.g., Partner, Client, Vendor).  

2. **AI-Powered OCR (Google Gemini)**  
   - The uploaded image is sent to **Google Gemini Vision** for intelligent text recognition and entity extraction.  
   - Gemini returns structured text data such as:  
     ```json
     {
       "Name": "Jung Hyun Park",
       "Position": "Head of Development",
       "Phone": "021231234",
       "Mobile": "0101231234",
       "Email": "abc@dc.com",
       "Company": "TOV",
       "Address": "6F, Donga Building, 212, Yeoksam-ro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul",
       "Website": "www.tov.com"
     }
     ```

3. **JSON Parsing & Cleanup**  
   - The text response from Gemini is cleaned and parsed into a valid JSON object using a Code node.

4. **Save to Notion**  
   - The parsed data is automatically inserted into your Notion database (`Customer Business Cards`).  
   - Fields such as Name, Email, Phone, Address, and Company are mapped to Notion properties.

- **Google Gemini (Vision)** – Extracts contact details from the image  
- **Code** – Parses Gemini’s output into structured JSON  
- **Notion** – Saves extracted contact info to your Notion database

## 📦 Integrations  
| Service | Purpose | Node Type |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Google Gemini (PaLM)** | Image-to-text extraction (OCR + structured entity parsing) | `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.googleGemini` |
| **Notion** | Contact data storage | `n8n-nodes-base.notion` |

---

## 🧰 Requirements  
- A connected **Google Gemini (PaLM)** API credential  
- A **Notion integration** with edit access to your database

## 💡 Tips  
- You can easily extend this workflow by adding an **email notification node** to confirm successful uploads.  
- For multilingual cards, Gemini Vision handles mixed-language text recognition well.  
- Adjust Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-1.5-pro`) based on your accuracy vs. speed needs.
