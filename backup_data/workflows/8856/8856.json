    "description": "**This template enriches a lead list by analyzing each contact’s company website and auto-generating a single personalized cold-email opener. Drop a spreadsheet into a Google Drive folder → the workflow parses rows, fetches website content via Jina AI, uses OpenAI to check if the site contains valid business info, then calls Anthropic to craft a one-liner. It writes both the website summary and personalized opener back to Google Sheets, and finally sends you a Telegram confirmation with the file link.**\n\n## What it does\nTurns a CSV/Google Sheet of leads into tailored cold-email openers. For each lead, the workflow fetches the company website, writes a 300-word business summary, then crafts a one-sentence, emotionally engaging opening line. Results are written back to the same Sheet, and you get a Telegram ping when processing finishes.\n\n## How it works (high-level)\n\t1.\tTrigger: Watches a Google Drive folder. When a new Sheet is added, the flow starts.\n\t2.\tParse: Reads rows (expects columns like First Name, Last Name, Email, domain).\n\t3.\tEnrich: An AI Agent calls Jina “r.jina.ai/{url}” to fetch page markdown, then produces a structured website summary.\n\t4.\tValidate: An OpenAI step checks if the fetched content is a real business page (hasWebsite: true/false).\n\t5.\tPersonalize:\n\t•\tIf true → Anthropic crafts a bespoke opener using the summary.\n\t•\tIf false → Fallback prompt creates a strong opener using domain + universal lead-gen pains.\n\t6.\tUpdate: Writes websiteSummary and personalization back to the Sheet (matching on domain).\n\t7.\tNotify: Sends a Telegram message with the file name + link when done.\n\n## What you need\n\t•\tGoogle Drive (folder to watch)\n\t•\tGoogle Sheets (the uploaded Sheet to enrich)\n\t•\tJina HTTP header auth (for the markdown fetch tool)\n\t•\tOpenAI (JSON check for website validity)\n\t•\tAnthropic (Claude Sonnet 4 for copy quality)\n\t•\tTelegram Bot (to receive completion alerts)\n\n## Inputs & expected schema\n\t•\tA Google Sheet with at least: First Name, Last Name, Email, domain\n\t•\tOptional columns are preserved; rows are processed in batches.\n\n## Outputs\n\t•\tNew/updated columns per row:\n\t•\twebsiteSummary — concise, structured business overview\n\t•\tpersonalization — a single, high-impact opening sentence\n\t•\tTelegram confirmation with file name and link.\n\n## Customization tips\n\t•\tTweak the system prompts for tone or length.\n\t•\tAdd scoring (e.g., ICP fit) before personalization.\n\t•\tExpand validation (e.g., handle multi-page sites or language detection).\n\t•\tSwap/parallel LLMs to balance quality, cost, and speed.\n\n## Nodes & key logic\n\t•\tGoogle Drive Trigger → Google Drive (Download) → Spreadsheet File (parse) → Split in Batches\n\t•\tLangChain Agent with: HTTP Tool (Jina) + Think\n\t•\tOpenAI (JSON validator) → If (website present?)\n\t•\tAnthropic Chat (with + without website branches)\n\t•\tEdit Fields (Set) → Google Sheets (Update) → Telegram\n\n## Great for\nSales teams, SDRs, and founders who want fast, high-quality personalization at scale without manual research.\n\n## **Need help customizing?**\nContact me for consulting and support: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariela-ceo-founder/)\n",
