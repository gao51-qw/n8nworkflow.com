  "description": "# 📥 Gmail Attachment Backup to Google Drive — n8n Workflow\n\nThis n8n workflow automatically backs up email attachments from a specific sender in Gmail to a designated folder in Google Drive. It polls Gmail every minute and uploads any new attachments from matching emails to the specified Google Drive folder with a timestamped filename.\n\n---\n\n## 📌 Use Case\n\n**Primary Purpose**:\n- Automatically archive and back up attachments from a specific sender (e.g., `test@gmail.com`) to Google Drive for safekeeping, audit, or processing.\n\n**Ideal For**:\n- Automating invoice/receipt collection from a vendor\n- Archiving reports from a monitored email address\n- Creating a searchable historical log of attachments for compliance\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Workflow Overview\n\nHere’s how the workflow operates:\n\n1. **🔔 Gmail Trigger**  \n   Polls Gmail every minute for new messages from a specific sender (`test@gmail.com`).\n\n2. **📩 Gmail Get Message**  \n   Retrieves the full contents (including attachments) of the matched email.\n\n3. **🧠 Code (JS)**  \n   Iterates over all binary attachments in the email and restructures them as individual binary items to upload separately.\n\n4. **📤 Google Drive**  \n   Uploads each attachment to a target Google Drive folder (`DOcs`) with a timestamp and unique name.\n\n5. **📍 Replace Me (NoOp)**  \n   Placeholder node to indicate workflow completion. You can replace this with Slack notifications, logs, or alerts.\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 How to Use\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- An [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance (self-hosted or cloud)\n- A connected Gmail account with OAuth2 credentials\n- A connected Google Drive account with OAuth2 credentials\n- Permissions for n8n to access your Gmail and Google Drive\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Import the Workflow**  \n   Copy and paste the workflow JSON into your n8n editor.\n\n2. **Set Up Credentials**  \n   Ensure the following credentials exist and are authorized:\n   - `Gmail (for Gmail nodes)\n   - `Google Drive (for Google Drive node)\n\n3. **Configure the Folder**  \n   Update the `folderId` in the Google Drive node if you want to use a different target folder.\n\n4. **Activate the Workflow**  \n   Enable the workflow in n8n. It will start polling Gmail every minute.\n\n---\n\n## ✏️ How to Customize\n\n| Task | How to Customize |\n|------|------------------|\n| Change sender filter | Modify the `sender` field in the **Gmail Trigger** node |\n| Adjust polling frequency | Change the `pollTimes` configuration in the trigger node |\n| Change destination folder | Update `folderId` in the **Google Drive** node |\n| Modify filename format | Edit the `name` expression in the **Google Drive** node |\n| Add post-upload logic | Replace or extend the **Replace Me** node with notifications, logs, etc. |\n| Process only specific attachments | Add logic in the **Code** node to filter by filename or MIME type |\n\n---\n\n## 📂 Filename Format Example\n\n```\n[MessageID]_[Timestamp]_backup_attachment\n```\n\nThis naming convention ensures uniqueness and traceability back to the original message.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Future Improvements\n\n- **Email subject filtering** to narrow down the match\n- **Slack/Email notifications** after upload\n- **Deduplication check** to avoid reuploading the same files\n- **Virus scan or file validation** before upload\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Support\n\nFor any issues using this workflow:\n- Double-check your credential permissions\n- Review n8n logs for Gmail or Google Drive errors\n- Visit the [n8n community forums](https://community.n8n.io)",
