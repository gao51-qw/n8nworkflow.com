**How it works:**
When a user submits a form with event details, the workflow sends this information to OpenAI's GPT-5 model, which generates a curated list of 18–32 songs tailored to the occasion and audience. The workflow then searches Spotify for each recommended song, creates a new playlist on the user's Spotify account, adds all the tracks, and sends the user an email with a direct link to listen.

**Key Features:**
- AI-Powered Playlist Generation: Uses OpenAI's GPT-5 model to create contextually relevant song recommendations based on event type, audience, and personal preferences.
- Automated Spotify Integration: Searches Spotify's API for each song and automatically adds them to a new playlist on the user's account.
- One-Click Listening: Users receive an email with a direct Spotify link to listen, follow, and modify the playlist immediately after creation.
- Multi-Language Support: The AI responds in the same language as the user's input, making the workflow accessible globally.
- Email Confirmation: Users instantly receive an email notification confirming playlist creation with a shareable Spotify link.
