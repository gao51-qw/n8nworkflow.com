  "description": "Who’s it for\n\nThis template is designed for small and medium businesses, startups, and agencies that want to automate customer inquiries, provide instant support, and capture leads without losing valuable conversations. It’s especially useful for teams that get many repetitive questions about products, services, or locations but don’t want to miss out on collecting contact details for follow-up.\n\nWhat it does / How it works\n\nThe workflow creates a 24/7 AI-powered chatbot that answers company-related questions and collects customer information. It uses:\n\t•\tGPT-4o for natural conversations\n\t•\tPinecone Vector Store for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with your company knowledge base\n\t•\tGoogle Sheets to store structured lead data\n\t•\tTelegram to instantly notify your team\n\nWhen a customer asks about products, services, or hours, the AI answers using the Pinecone database. Afterwards, it politely asks for their name, email, phone number, and interest. The details are saved to Google Sheets and your team receives a Telegram message with a summary.\n\nHow to set up\n\t1.\tConnect your OpenAI account.\n\t2.\tCreate a Pinecone index with company FAQs, documents, or policies.\n\t3.\tLink your Google Sheet with columns: Name, Email, Phone, Interested in.\n\t4.\tAdd your Telegram bot token and chat/group ID.\n\t5.\tReplace [INSERT_YOUR_COMPANY_NAME_HERE] in the system prompt with your company name.\n\nRequirements\n\t•\tOpenAI API key\n\t•\tPinecone account\n\t•\tGoogle Sheets access\n\t•\tTelegram bot & chat ID\n\nHow to customize\n\t•\tChange the system prompt to match your brand’s tone.\n\t•\tUpdate the Pinecone namespace and embeddings model if needed.\n\t•\tAdd extra fields in Google Sheets (e.g., “Budget” or “Preferred product”).\n\t•\tExtend the flow with CRM integrations or automated email follow-ups.\n\nWith this setup, you get a smart, RAG-powered chatbot that not only answers questions but also turns every conversation into a potential lead.",
