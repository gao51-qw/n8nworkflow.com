# AI-powered Meeting Summaries and Action Items to Slack and ClickUp

## How it Works  
1. **Webhook Trigger**: The workflow starts when Fireflies notifies that a transcription has finished.  
2. **Transcript Retrieval**: The transcript is pulled from Fireflies based on the meeting ID.  
3. **Pre-processing**: The transcript is split into sentences and then aggregated into a raw text block.  
4. **AI Summarization**: The aggregated transcript is sent to Google Gemini, which generates a short summary and a structured list of action items.  
5. **Post-processing**: The AI response is cleaned and formatted into JSON. Action items are mapped to titles and descriptions.  
6. **Distribution**:  
   - The meeting summary is posted to Slack.  
   - Action items are created as tasks in ClickUp.
