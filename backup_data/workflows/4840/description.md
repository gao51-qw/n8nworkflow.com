# Overview

This n8n workflow creates a chatbot that understands natural language requests for finding business prospects and automatically:

* Interprets your query using AI (Claude Sonnet 3.7)
* Converts it to proper Explorium API filters
* Validates the API request structure
* Fetches prospect data from Explorium
* Exports results as a downloadable CSV file

Perfect for sales teams, recruiters, and business development professionals who need to quickly find and export targeted prospect lists without learning complex API syntax.

# Key Features

* **Natural Language Interface**: Simply describe who you're looking for in plain English
* **Smart Query Translation**: AI converts your request to valid API parameters
* **Built-in Validation**: Ensures API calls meet Explorium's requirements
* **Error Recovery**: Automatically retries with corrections if validation fails
* **Pagination Support**: Handles large result sets automatically
* **CSV Export**: Clean, formatted output ready for CRM import
* **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context for follow-up queries

# Example Queries

# How It Works

## Workflow Architecture

1. **Chat Trigger**: Receives natural language queries from users
2. **Memory Buffer**: Maintains conversation context
3. **AI Agent**: Interprets queries and generates API parameters
4. **Validation**: Checks API structure against Explorium requirements
5. **API Call**: Fetches prospect data with pagination
6. **Data Processing**: Formats results for CSV export
7. **File Conversion**: Creates downloadable CSV file

## Processing Flow

```
User Query → AI Interpretation → Validation → API Call → CSV Export
     ↑                                  ↓
     └──── Error Correction Loop ←──────┘
```

## Validation Rules

The workflow validates:

* Filter keys are allowed by Explorium API
* Values match expected formats (e.g., valid country codes)
* Range filters have proper gte/lte values
* No duplicate values in arrays
* Required structure is maintained

# Usage Guide

## Basic Conversation Flow

1. **Start with your query**:
   ```
   "Find me VPs of Sales at software companies in the US"
   ```

2. **Bot processes and responds**:
   * Generates API filters
   * Validates the structure
   * Fetches data
   * Returns CSV download link

3. **Refine if needed**:
   ```
   "Can you also include directors and filter for companies with 100+ employees?"
   ```

## Query Tips

* **Be specific**: Include job titles, departments, company details
* **Use standard terms**: "CTO" instead of "Chief Technology Officer"
* **Specify locations**: Use country names or standard codes
* **Include size/revenue**: Helps narrow results effectively

## Advanced Queries

Combine multiple criteria:

```
"Find engineering managers and senior engineers at B2B SaaS companies 
in New York and California with 50-500 employees and revenue over $5M 
who have been in their role for at least 1 year"
```

# Output Format

The CSV file includes:

* Prospect ID
* Name (first, last, full)
* Location (country, region, city)
* LinkedIn profile
* Experience summary
* Skills and interests
* Company details
* Job information
* Business ID

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

**"Validation failed" errors**

* Check that your query uses supported filter values
* Ensure location names are spelled correctly
* Verify company sizes/revenues match allowed ranges

**No results returned**

* Broaden your search criteria
* Check if the company exists in Explorium's database
* Verify filter combinations aren't too restrictive

**Chat not responding**

* Ensure workflow is activated
* Check all credentials are properly configured
* Verify webhook URL is accessible

**Large result sets timing out**

* Try adding more specific filters
* Limit results by location or company size
* Use the size parameter (max 10,000)

## Error Messages

The bot provides clear feedback:

* **Invalid filters**: Shows which filters aren't supported
* **Value errors**: Lists correct options for each field
* **API failures**: Explains connection or authentication issues

# Performance Optimization

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with basic criteria and add filters
2. **Use business IDs**: When targeting specific companies
3. **Limit by contact info**: Add `has_email: true` for actionable leads
4. **Batch by location**: Process regions separately for large searches

## API Limits

* Maximum 10,000 results per search
* Pagination handles up to 100 records per page
* Rate limits apply based on your Explorium subscription

# Customization Options

## Modify AI Behavior

Edit the **AI Agent** system message to:

* Change response format
* Add custom filters
* Adjust interpretation logic
* Include additional instructions

## Extend Functionality

Add nodes to:

* Send results via email
* Import directly to CRM
* Schedule recurring searches
* Create custom reports

## Integration Ideas

* Connect to Slack for team queries
* Add to CRM workflows
* Create lead scoring systems
* Build automated outreach campaigns

* API credentials are stored securely in n8n
* Chat sessions are isolated
* No prospect data is stored permanently
* CSV files are generated on-demand
