## Who’s it for  
Recruiters, B2B marketers, and thought-leadership builders who want to boost their LinkedIn engagement by automatically liking fresh, relevant posts—while staying under LinkedIn’s daily limits.

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Schedule Trigger** runs hourly at a specified minute.  
2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating LinkedIn session-cookie (time-slice logic).  
3. **Generate Random Search Term** (GPT-4o) outputs a realistic AI/BPA keyword.  
4. **Phantombuster LinkedIn Content Search Agent** scrapes recent posts → **Get Posts**.  
5. **Get Random Post** selects one post, checks it isn’t already liked (SharePoint CSV) and appends the company-ID query param. If a personal LinkedIn Account is used, no company-ID is needed.
6. Creates `linkedin_posts_to_like.csv`, uploads to SharePoint, and provides the URL to **Autolike Agent** which likes the post.  
7. The post URL is added to `linkedin_posts_already_liked.csv` to avoid duplicates.  
8. **Wait** nodes throttle launches to ≈400 likes/day.

## How to set up  
1. Add credentials: Phantombuster API, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  
2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder create:  
   • `linkedin_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  
   • `linkedin_posts_already_liked.csv` with header `postUrl`.  
3. Update **Set ENV Variables** with your LinkedIn company ID (`ENV_COMPANY_ID_LINKEDIN`).  
4. Adjust schedule or likes-per-launch as needed.  
5. Activate the workflow; it will run hourly and like one new post per launch.

## How to customize
