Automated Social Media Content Generator with ChatGPT & Tavily Research

This n8n template turns a simple spreadsheet of ideas into ready-to-publish content for LinkedIn, X, and Instagram.
It uses Tavily to find recent insights from the web and ChatGPT to craft optimized posts automatically — writing results back to your sheet.

⚙️ Good to know

Triggers automatically when a new row is added to your Google Sheet.

Uses Tavily for intelligent web research based on your topic.

Generates three platform-specific posts (LinkedIn, X, IG) using ChatGPT.

Saves all results back into the same sheet — no manual copying.

Requires API keys for OpenAI, Tavily, and Google Sheets credentials.

🧭 How it works
Step 1 — Watch the Sheet & Prepare Inputs

A Google Sheets Trigger monitors your content sheet with six columns:

Campaign

Content topic

Target audience

LinkedIn

X

IG

The Set Search Fields node structures this data for later steps.

Step 2 — Research with Tavily

The Search Internet node calls Tavily’s API (insert your key here) to fetch fresh news and articles about the topic.

Split Out unfolds the search results; Aggregate compiles them into a single, clean dataset used by the LLMs.

Step 3 — Generate Platform-Optimized Posts

Each platform uses a dedicated ChatGPT agent:

LinkedIn – long-form, insightful, paragraph breaks, 1–2 emojis, 3–5 hashtags, and a call to action.

X – ≤ 280 characters, concise and catchy, 1–3 hashtags, 1–2 emojis.

Instagram – scannable text with CTA, hashtags, and image suggestions for posts/carousels.

Finally, Update Campaign writes the generated posts back into your sheet (LinkedIn, X, and IG columns) using the campaign name as the match key.
