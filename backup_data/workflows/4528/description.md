This n8n workflow processes incoming Telegram messages, differentiating between text and voice messages.

### How it works:
1.  **Message Trigger**: The workflow initiates when a new message is received via the Telegram "Message Trigger" node.
2.  **Switch Node**: This node acts as a router. It examines the incoming message:
    * If the message is `text`, it directs the flow along the "text" branch.
    * If the message contains `voice`, it directs the flow along the "voice" branch.
3.  **Get Audio File**: For audio messages, this node downloads the audio file from Telegram.
4.  **Transcribe Audio**: The downloaded audio file is then sent to an "OpenAI Transcribe Recording" node, which uses OpenAI's `whisper-1` speech-to-text model to convert the audio into a text transcript.
5.  **Send Transcription Message**: Regardless of whether the original message was text or transcribed audio, the final text content is then passed to a "Send transcription message" node.

### Setup Requirements:
* **Telegram Bot Token**: You will need a Telegram bot token configured in the "Message Trigger" node to receive messages.
* **OpenAI API Key**: An OpenAI API key is required for the "Transcribe audio" node to perform speech transcription.

### Additional Notes:
This workflow provides a foundational step for building more complex AI-driven applications. The transcribed text or original text message can be easily piped into an AI agent (e.g., a large language model) for analysis, response generation, or interaction with other tools, extending the bot's capabilities beyond simple message reception and transcription.
