## Who’s it for 👥
This template is perfect for content creators, marketers, and researchers managing WeChat public account articles! 🚀 It’s ideal for n8n newcomers or anyone wanting to save time on manual content analysis, especially if you use Google Sheets for tracking. 📊 Whether you’re into AI, 欧阳良宜, or automation, this is for you! 😄

## How it works / What it does 🔧
This workflow automates the retrieval, filtering, classification, and summarization of WeChat articles. 🌐 It reads RSS feed links from a Google Sheet, filters articles from the last 10 days ⏳, cleans HTML content 🧹, classifies them as relevant or not 🎯, generates insightful Chinese summaries with AI 🤖, and saves results to Google Sheets and Notion. 📝 Outputs are Slack-formatted for team collaboration! 💬

## How to set up 🛠️
1. **Prepare Google Sheets**: Use your own documentId (replace the example) and set up sheets "Save Initial Links" (gid=198451233) and "Save Processed Data" (gid=1936091950). 📋
2. **Configure Credentials**: Add Google Sheets and OpenAI API credentials—avoid hardcoding keys! 🔐
3. **Set RSS Feed**: Update the rss_feed_url in the "RSS Read" node with your WeChat RSS feed. 🌐
4. **Customize AI**: Tweak "Relevance Classification" and "Basic LLM Chain" prompts for your topics (e.g., 欧阳良宜, AI). 🎨
5. **Notion (Optional)**: Swap the databaseId (e.g., 22e79d55-2675-8055-a143-d55302c3c1b1) with your own. 📚
6. **Run Workflow**: Trigger manually via the "When clicking ‘Execute workflow’" node. 🚀
