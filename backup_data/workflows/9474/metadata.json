  "description": "## Send smart, personalized welcome emails to any Jotform lead\n\nThis workflow intelligently qualifies new Jotform leads and sends the perfect welcome email every time. It detects whether a lead is using a business or personal email address and tailors the outreach accordingly—either with deep company research for B2B leads or a warm, direct welcome for B2C leads.\n\n## Who's it for?\n- **Businesses with mixed audiences:** Companies that serve both business clients and individual users.\n- **Sales & Marketing Teams:** To automate lead qualification and send context-aware first-touch emails.\n- **Founders & Solopreneurs:** To ensure every new lead gets a relevant, personalized welcome without manual effort.\n\n## How it works\n1.  **Trigger:** The workflow starts on a new Jotform submission.\n2.  **Filter:** It checks if the lead's email is a work email (e.g., `jane@mycompany.com`) or a personal one (e.g., `john@gmail.com`).\n3.  **Path A (Work Email):** The workflow researches the company using Perplexity AI and then uses OpenAI to draft a deeply personalized email referencing company-specific details.\n4.  **Path B (Personal Email):** The workflow skips the research and uses OpenAI to draft a warm, friendly, but more general welcome email.\n5.  **Send:** The appropriate, context-aware email is sent to the new lead via Gmail.\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Jotform:** Connect your Jotform credentials and choose your lead capture form. **Important:** Your form must contain fields with the exact names `name` and `email`. You can add other fields for more context (e.g., `company_size`).\n2.  **Credentials:** Connect your Perplexity AI, OpenAI, and Gmail accounts.\n3.  **Activate Workflow:** Turn the workflow on.\n\n## Requirements\n- An [n8n account](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/hsfk0lhyvur4).\n- A [Jotform account](https://www.jotform.com/?partner=fahmifahreza).\n- A Perplexity AI account with API access.\n- An OpenAI account with API access.\n- A Gmail account.\n\n## How to customize the workflow\n- **Filter Logic:** Add more personal email domains (e.g., `icloud.com`) to the list in the `Check if Email is Work or Personal` node to improve filtering.\n- **Prompts:** Customize the prompts in both the AI Agent nodes to match your brand's voice and tone.",
