# WhatsApp AI Agent: Auto-Train Product Data & Handle Customer Support

## Who Is This For

This workflow is ideal for **eCommerce founders**, **product managers**, **customer support teams**, and **automation builders** who rely on WhatsApp to manage product information and interact with clients.

It’s perfect for businesses that want to **automate product data entry and support responses** directly from WhatsApp messages using GPT-4 and Google Sheets.

## What Problem Does This Workflow Solve

- **Manual Product Data Entry**: Collecting and organizing product data from links is tedious and error-prone.  
- **Slow Customer Response Times**: Responding to client questions manually leads to delays and inconsistent support.  
- **No Logging System for Issues**: Without automation, support issues often go undocumented, making it harder to learn and improve.

## What This Workflow Does

### Step 1 – Incoming Message Detection
- Listens for incoming messages via WhatsApp.
- If the message starts with `train:`, it routes to the product training process.
- Otherwise, it routes to the customer support assistant.

### Step 2 – Product Data Training
- **Extracts URL** from the message using a regex script.
- **Fetches HTML content** from the URL.
- **Cleans HTML data** to extract readable product description.
- **Saves raw data** (URL + description) into Google Sheets.
- **Uses GPT-4** to enhance product data:  
  → Name, price (one-time or subscription), topic, and FAQs.  
- **Updates the product row** in Google Sheets with structured information.

### Step 3 – Customer Support Flow
- Analyzes user messages with GPT-4 to understand the request or issue.
- Looks up relevant product info in Google Sheets.
- Detects potential problems (e.g. payment, login, delivery).
- Suggests an appropriate solution.
- Logs the problem, solution, and category to the `Customer Issues` sheet.
- Sends a response back to the client via WhatsApp.

### Step 4 – Client Response
- Sends the AI-generated response to the client via WhatsApp.
- Keeps the communication fast, clear, and professional.
