  "description": "## Audit permissions in Confluence to ensure compliance\n\nThis workflow scans selected **Confluence spaces** for **public exposure risks**, helping teams identify unintended access and potential data leakage.\n\n### What it does\n- Detects public exposure risks in Confluence spaces, including:\n  - **Anonymous access permissions** at space level\n  - Whether **public links are enabled**\n  - Pages with **active or blocked public links**\n- Uses **Confluence REST API v2** together with the **Atlassian GraphQL API**.\n- Produces a consolidated per-space report containing:\n  - Anonymous access permissions\n  - Public link status\n  - Pages with public links (title, status, URL, enabled-by user)\n- Ideal for **security audits**, **compliance reviews**, and **data leakage prevention**.\n\n### How it works\n- The workflow starts via a **Manual Trigger**.\n- A **Set Variables** node defines:\n  - `atlassianDomain`\n  - `spaceKeys` (comma-separated)\n- **Get Spaces (v2)** retrieves matching spaces and splits them into individual items.\n- For each space, three **GraphQL queries** run in parallel:\n  - Retrieve **anonymous access permissions**\n  - Check **public link feature status** at space level\n  - Fetch **pages with public links** (ON / BLOCKED)\n- Results from all three queries are merged and normalized into a single per-space report.\n\n### Setup\n- Configure the **Set Variables** node:\n  - `atlassianDomain` → your Confluence base URL  \n  - `spaceKeys` → comma-separated list (e.g. `ENG, HR`)\n- Create an **HTTP Basic Auth** credential for Atlassian:\n  - Email + API token\n  - Assign it to all HTTP and GraphQL nodes\n- Ensure the credential has permission to:\n  - Read spaces\n  - Read space permissions\n  - Access GraphQL endpoints\n- Execute the workflow manually to generate the report.\n\n### Notes\n- Uses the **Atlassian GraphQL API**, which exposes permission and public-link data not fully available via REST.\n- Pages with blocked public links are included for visibility.\n- The GraphQL page query fetches up to **250 pages per space**.",
