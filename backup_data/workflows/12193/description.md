   - Processed through remove.bg to remove the background
   - Transparent PNG is uploaded to Google Drive
   - OpenAI generates a professional mockup based on product image
   - Final mockup uploaded on Drive & notify user

   - Image downloaded from the URL
   - Background removal and mockup generation process is applied
   - Results are delivered back to the user
