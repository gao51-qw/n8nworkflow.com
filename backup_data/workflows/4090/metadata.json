  "description": "# n8n Workflow Backup to Google Drive – Automated Export of All Your Workflows\n\nThis workflow is designed to automatically create backups of all your workflows in n8n and store them as individual .json files in Google Drive. It's a fully automated system that helps developers, agencies, or automation teams ensure their automation logic is always safe, versioned, and ready to restore or share.\n\n## What is this for?\nIf you’re building and managing multiple automations inside n8n, losing a workflow due to accidental deletion or misconfiguration can cost you hours of work. This template solves that by exporting all your workflows into separate files and storing them in a dated Google Drive folder. It helps with disaster recovery, version tracking, and team collaboration — without any manual exporting.\n\n## How this works:\n-Once triggered (manually or via a schedule), the workflow performs the following steps:\n-Creates a new folder in your Google Drive, named with today’s date (e.g. “Workflow Backups Monday 16-05-2025”).\n-Connects to your n8n instance using the internal API and retrieves a list of all existing workflows.\n-Iterates over each workflow, converts it into a .json file using the built-in file conversion node.\n-Uploads each individual .json file to the newly created folder in Google Drive.\n-Optionally, the workflow finds and deletes old backup folders to keep your Google Drive clean and avoid clutter.\n\nYou get a clean, timestamped folder with all your flows — ready to restore, send, or store securely.\nYou can trigger it manually or schedule it (e.g., to run weekly on Monday mornings).\n\n## How to set it up:\nImport the provided workflow JSON into your n8n instance.\nSet up your credentials:\n-Replace the placeholder “Google demo” with your actual Google Drive OAuth2 credentials in all Google Drive nodes.\n-Replace the placeholder “n8n demo” with your n8n API credentials so the workflow can fetch your flows.\n-Go to the node “Create new folder” and replace the folder ID with your own destination folder in Google Drive where backups should be stored.\n-(Optional) Enable the “Schedule Trigger” to run the backup automatically once a week or on your preferred interval.\n\n## You’re ready to go — test it with the Manual Trigger first and check your Google Drive for results.\n\n",
