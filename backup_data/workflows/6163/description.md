## 🔍 Design Rationale & Best Practices  

**AI Personalization Boosts Follow-Through**  
Personalized messages and human-sounding voice notes significantly increase user engagement and trust.

**Multi-Channel Confirmation**  
Email + calendar + SMS ensures the user receives the booking details via their preferred method.

**AI Agents for Edge Cases**  
Agents are used for formatting and natural-language generation to make the system flexible and future-proof.

**Minimal Manual Input Required**  
Clients simply fill out a form — the rest is handled with high-quality automation.

**Fully Extensible**  
Swap in different voice APIs, CRMs, or calendar providers with minimal changes to the core logic.
