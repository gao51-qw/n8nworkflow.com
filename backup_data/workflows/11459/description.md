# Text-to-Image Generator with OpenAI

## What It Is

This is an automated text-to-image generation system that converts simple subject descriptions into AI-generated photos using OpenAI's image generation technology.

## Setup

The system works through a streamlined workflow:

1. You input a subject or brief description into a designated note field
2. The system automatically expands your simple subject into a detailed, comprehensive prompt
3. This enhanced prompt is sent to OpenAI's image generator
4. Once the image is created, it is automatically saved to your Google Drive for easy access and storage
5. You receive a notification in Slack to view it
