  "description": "\n## Who is this for\nThis template is essential for **Remote Operations Managers**, **HR Teams**, and **Project Leads** managing distributed teams across different countries. It prevents scheduling conflicts by automatically flagging when a regional team is out of office and identifying when multiple teams are off simultaneously.\n\n## What it does\nStop manually Googling \"Is it a holiday in Berlin today?\" This workflow automates your team availability calendar.\n1.  It triggers on a weekly schedule.\n2.  It takes your team's locations (e.g., KR, MX) and a \"Lookahead\" range (e.g., 50 days).\n3.  It fetches official public holidays for **both the current and next year** using the **Nager.Date API** (to ensure year-end holidays aren't missed).\n4.  It filters the results to find only holidays occurring within your defined lookahead window.\n5.  **It compares dates across countries to identify \"Shared Holidays\" (dates where multiple teams are off).**\n6.  It logs these holidays into a **Notion** database and notifies the team via **Slack**, specifically highlighting if a holiday is shared.\n\n## How to set up\n1.  **Notion:** Create a Database with properties: `Name` (Title), `Date` (Date), and `Shared Countries` (Text).\n2.  **Slack:** Connect your Slack account in the credentials.\n3.  **Configuration:**\n    *   **Define Team Countries:** Enter the 2-letter country codes (e.g., \"KR\", \"US\") in the Set node.\n    *   **Define Days to Lookahead:** Set how many days into the future you want to check (default is 50).\n    *   **Add to Notion:** Select your Database ID.\n\n## How to customize\n*   **Filter Logic:** The \"Filter Upcoming\" node handles the date logic. You can modify this to check for specific holiday types (e.g., exclude \"Optional\" holidays).\n*   **Shared Logic:** The \"Find Shared Holidays\" node calculates overlaps. You can adjust the JavaScript here if you want to change the format of the shared message sent to Slack.\n*   **Destinations:** Swap the Notion node for Google Calendar to block off time directly.",
