### How it works:
- Automatically detects when a new receipt is uploaded to Google Drive.
- Extracts text from the receipt using OCR.
- Uses an AI Agent to analyze the extracted data and structure it (e.g., vendor, date, total, tax).
- Saves the organized receipt data into a Google Sheet for easy tracking.

### Set up steps:
- Setup takes around 15–20 minutes.
- You'll need a Google Drive folder for receipts and a Google Sheet to store results.
- Configure your Google Drive Trigger, OCR extraction, AI Agent, and Google Sheets connection.
