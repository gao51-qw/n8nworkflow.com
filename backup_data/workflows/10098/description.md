This workflow automates a **batch upload of multiple videos to YouTube**, spacing each upload **12 hours apart** in **Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)** and automatically adding them to a playlist.

### ⚙️ Workflow Logic

1. **Manual Trigger** — Starts the workflow manually.  
2. **List Video Files** — Uses a shell command to find all `.mp4` files under the specified directory (`/opt/downloads/单词卡/A1-A2`).  
3. **Sort and Generate Items** — Sorts videos by day number (`dayXX`) extracted from filenames and assigns a sequential `order` value.  
4. **Calculate Publish Schedule (+12h Interval)** —  
   - Computes the next rounded JST hour plus a configurable buffer (default 30 min).  
   - Staggers each video’s scheduled time by `order × 12 hours`.  
   - Converts JST back to UTC for YouTube’s `publishAt` field.  
5. **Split in Batches (1 per video)** — Iterates over each video item.  
6. **Read Video File** — Loads the corresponding video from disk.  
7. **Upload to YouTube (Scheduled)** — Uploads the video privately with the computed `publishAtUtc`.  
8. **Add to Playlist** — Adds the newly uploaded video to the target playlist.

### 🕒 Highlights

- **Timezone-safe:** Pure UTC ↔ JST conversion avoids double-offset errors.  
- **Sequential scheduling:** Ensures each upload is 12 hours apart to prevent clustering.  
- **Customizable:** Change `SPAN_HOURS`, `BUFFER_MIN`, or directory paths easily.  
- **Retry-ready:** Each upload and playlist step has retry logic to handle transient errors.

### 💡 Typical Use Cases

- Multi-part educational video series (e.g., A1–A2 English learning).  
- Regular content release cadence without manual scheduling.  
- Automated YouTube publishing pipelines for pre-produced content.
