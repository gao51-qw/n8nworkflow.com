This n8n workflow helps users easily discover nearby residential construction projects by automatically scraping and analyzing property listings from 99acres and other real estate platforms. Users can send an email with their location preferences and receive a curated list of available properties with detailed information, including pricing, area, possession dates, and construction status.

## **Good to know**
* The workflow focuses specifically on residential construction projects and active developments
* Property data is scraped in real-time to ensure the most current information
* Results are automatically formatted and structured for easy reading
* The system handles multiple property formats and data variations from different sources
* Fallback mechanisms ensure reliable data extraction even when website structures change

## **How it works**
* **Trigger: New Email** - Detects incoming emails with property search requests and extracts location preferences from email content
* **Extract Area & City** - Parses the email body to identify target areas (e.g., Gota, Ahmedabad) and falls back to city-level search if specific area is not mentioned
* **Scrape Construction Projects** - Performs web scraping on 99acres and other property websites based on the extracted area and city information
* **Parse Project Listings** - Cleans and formats the scraped HTML data into structured project entries with standardized fields
* **Format Project Details** - Transforms all parsed projects into a consistent email-ready list format with bullet points and organized information
* **Send Results to User** - Delivers a professionally formatted email with the complete list of matching construction projects to the original requester
