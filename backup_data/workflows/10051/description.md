# ## Podcast on Autopilot — Generate Podcast Ideas, Scripts & Audio Automatically with Eleven Labs, GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.0

Bring your solo podcast to life — on full autopilot. This workflow uses GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet to turn a single topic input into a complete podcast episode intro and ready-to-send audio file.

## How it works

Start a chat trigger – enter a seed idea or topic (e.g., “habits,” “failure,” “technology and purpose”).

Podcast Idea Agent (GPT-5) instantly crafts a thought-provoking, Rogan- or Bartlett-style episode concept with a clear angle and takeaway.

Podcast Script Agent (Claude 4.0 Sonnet) expands that idea into a natural, engaging 60-second opening monologue ready for recording.

Text-to-Speech via ElevenLabs automatically converts the script into a high-quality voice track.

Email automation sends the finished MP3 directly to your inbox.

## Perfect for
• Solo creators who want to ideate, script and voice short podcasts effortlessly
• Content teams prototyping daily or weekly audio snippets
• Anyone testing AI-driven storytelling pipelines


## Customization tips
• Swap ElevenLabs with your preferred TTS service by editing the HTTP Request node.
• Adjust prompt styles for tone or audience in the Idea and Script Agents.
• Modify the Gmail (or other mail service) node to send audio to any destination (Drive, Slack, Notion, etc.).
• For reuse at scale, add variables for episode number, guest name, or theme category — just clone and update the trigger node.
