# 🤖 AI Q&A Chatbot Workflow – Build Your Own AI Agent Trained on Private Documents

This powerful AI automation add-on upgrades your [Telegram Bot Starter Template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2402-telegram-bot-starter-template-setup-and-ai-chatbot/) by integrating a fully functional **AI chatbot** and a **context-aware AI agent** that answers user questions using your internal documents.

Unlike generic bots, this chatbot uses **your own data** to respond with deeply personalized, context-relevant information — perfect for **support**, **onboarding**, **internal knowledge access**, and **client-facing** interactions.

It connects to any **PostgreSQL database** — including [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech), Supabase, or a self-hosted Postgres setup — allowing you to build **custom AI-powered FAQ assistants**, **internal support bots**, or **knowledge-based customer service tools**.

## 🧠 Why It Works: Contextual Retrieval

The secret is **Contextual Retrieval** — a powerful technique where your documents are stored in a way that preserves **meaning and context**. This allows the AI to fetch **highly relevant, source-backed responses**, eliminating hallucinations and guesswork.

&gt; Data is embedded, chunked, and saved in a **vector database** (Postgres + PGVector), enabling smart **semantic search** tailored to your needs.
