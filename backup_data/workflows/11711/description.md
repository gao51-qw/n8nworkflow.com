## How It Works
This workflow automates personalized customer journeys by analyzing CRM data, purchase history, chat interactions, and performance metrics to intelligently route customer actions through multiple channels (email, SMS, retargeting) via AI-optimized schemas. A webhook trigger initiates the process by fetching CRM customer data, which is then merged with historical records and interactions. OpenAI builds comprehensive customer state profiles, enabling intelligent routing to appropriate channels using optimized journey logic. The system aggregates performance metrics in real-time and updates the database to maintain synchronized customer information across all systems.

1. Connect CRM credentials (source system)
