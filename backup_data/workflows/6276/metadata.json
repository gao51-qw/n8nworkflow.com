  "description": "**This workflow acts as your personal AI-powered analyst for Meta Ads.** \n\nIt's pretty straightforward:\n\n1. First, it grabs a list of Facebook Ad Library URLs you want to check out from a Google Sheet.\n2. Then, it automatically scrapes the active ads from those pages.\n\nHere's the cool part: it sends each ad's image and text to Google Gemini, which analyzes it like an expert marketer would.\n\nFinally, Gemini's full analysis—we're talking strengths, weaknesses, actionable suggestions, and a performance score—gets dropped neatly into another Google Sheet for you.\n\n**Set up steps**\n\nYou should be ready to roll in about 5 minutes. There are no complex configurations, you just need to:\n\n1. Connect your accounts: The workflow has placeholders waiting for your credentials for Google (for Sheets and the Gemini API) and ScrapingFlash.\n2. Link your Google Sheets: Just point the first Google Sheets node to the sheet with your URLs, and tell the last node where you want to save the results.\n\nAll the nitty-gritty details and expressions are explained in the sticky notes inside the workflow itself!",
