  "description": "# Automated FTP/SFTP to MinIO Object Backup with Scheduling\n\n$\\mapsto$ Can work with FTP/SFTP Servers like your Wordpress Website ! \n\n## What this workflow does ?\n\nThis workflow performs automated, periodic backups of files from a FTP or SFTP server directory to a MinIO S3 bucket running locally or on a dedicated container/VM/server. It can also work if the MinIO bucket is running on a remote cloud provider's infrastructure; you just need to change the URL and keys.\n\n## Who's this intended for ?\n\nStorage administrators, cloud architects, or DevOps who need a simple and scalable solution for retrieving data from a remote FTP or SFTP Server.\n\nThis can also be practical for Wordpress Devs that need to backup data from a server hosting a Wordpress Website. \n\nIn that case, you'll just need to specify the folder that you want to backup (could be one from wordpress/uploads or even the root one)\n\n## How it works\n\nThis workflow uses commands to list and download files from a specific directory on a FTP-SFTP Server, then send them to MinIO using their version of the S3 API.\n\nThe source directory can be a specific one or the entire server (the root directory)\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nNone, just a source folder/directory on a FTP/SFTP Server and a destination bucket on MinIO. You'll also need to get MinIO running. You're using Proxmox VE ? Create a MinIO LXC Container : https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=minio\n\n## Need a Backup from another Cloud Storage Provider ?\n\nNeed automated backup from another Cloud Storage Provider ?\n\n$\\mapsto$ Check out our templates, we've done it with AWS, Azure, and GCP, and we even have a version for FTP/SFTP servers!\n\n$\\odot$ These workflow can be integrated to bigger ones and modified to best suit your needs ! You can, for example, replace the MinIO node to another S3 Bucket from another Cloud Storage Provider (Backblaze, Wasabi, Scaleway, OVH, ...)\n",
