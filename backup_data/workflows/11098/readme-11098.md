# Track website changes with Firecrawl, GPT-5-Mini, Notion, and Gmail

> ## Stay Updated on Website Changes Automatically  

Manually checking websites for updates or competitor changes can be tedious. This workflow automates the process by scraping target pages, capturing screenshots, and analyzing content changes using **Firecrawl** and **GPT-5-mini**. All updates are saved in **Notion**, and you can optionally receive email alerts — keeping you informed without lifting a finger.

* **Notion Integration**  
  Stores snapshots, comparisons, and summaries directly in Notion for easy reference.

* **GPT-Powered Comparison**  
  Highlights meaningful changes between snapshots using GPT-5-mini.

* **Change Criteria Input**

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Add Target URLs  

Paste one or more websites you want to monitor. The workflow accepts multiple URLs in JSON format for scalable tracking.  

---

### 2. Setup Firecrawl Credential  

Use **Firecrawl** to scrape website data without dealing with complex API setups.  

**Steps:**  
1. Go to [firecrawl.dev/app](https://firecrawl.dev/app) and sign up.  
2. Copy your **API Key** from the dashboard.  
3. In n8n, open the **Firecrawl** node, add a new credential, and paste the key.  
4. Test the node to ensure the connection works.  

---

### 3. Setup OpenAI API Key  

The workflow uses **GPT-5-mini** to analyze and summarize website changes.  

**Steps:**  
1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) if you haven’t already.  
2. Generate a new **API Key** in your OpenAI dashboard.  
3. In n8n, open the **GPT** node, add a new credential, and paste the API key.  
4. Test the node to ensure it can successfully call the API.  

---

### 4. Setup Gmail for Email Alerts  

1. In n8n, open the **Gmail** node.  
2. Click **Add New Credentials** and select **OAuth2**.  
3. Follow the Google OAuth setup to allow n8n to send emails on your behalf.  
4. Choose the recipient and customize the alert formatting to include snapshots and summaries.  

---

### 5. Configure the Workflow  

1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Add your target URLs in JSON format.  
3. Paste your Firecrawl API Key into the Firecrawl node.  
4. Add your OpenAI API key to the GPT node.  
5. Authenticate Gmail if email notifications are desired.  
6. Set your preferred **change criteria** to filter meaningful updates.  
7. Adjust the schedule for daily execution or your preferred frequency.

4. **Apply Change Criteria:** Only updates that meet your defined criteria are logged.  
5. **Save Updates:** Changes are stored in Notion with visual and text summaries.  
6. **Optional Alerts:** Sends Gmail notifications with updates.
