  "description": "\nThis workflow is a simple example showing how to fetch submissions from JotForm using its API and then use that data in another service — in this case, Google Sheets.\n\n## It demonstrates the basics of:\n\n- Connecting to an API\n\n- Parsing the response\n\n- Looping through results\n\n- Sending processed data to another app\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Manual Trigger\nStarts the workflow manually.\n(Can be replaced with a schedule or webhook trigger for automation.)\n\n2. HTTP Request – Get Submissions from JotForm\nFetches all submissions for a specific form from the JotForm API.\n\n3. Code Node – Parse API Response\nConverts the API’s JSON response into individual submission items.\n\n4. Split In Batches – Loop Through Each Submission\nProcesses submissions one at a time to avoid hitting API rate limits.\n\n5. Wait Node\nAdds a short delay before sending data to the next API.\n\n6. Google Sheets – Append Submission Data\nSends the selected fields from each JotForm submission into a Google Sheet:\n\n\n\n## Adaptations\nYou can modify this workflow to:\n\nSend JotForm results to CRM systems like HubSpot or Pipedrive\n\nTrigger email or Slack notifications for each new submission\n\nStore submissions in a database for reporting and analytics",
