  "description": "## 🤯 Problem of Traditional Bookkeeping\n- 🔀 **Context switch kills the habit**: Because bookkeeping lives outside the apps you use every day, you postpone it → **forget to log**.\n- 🧱 **High input friction**: You’re forced to fill rigid fields (amount/category/date/notes…), which is slow and discouraging for quick capture.\n- 🎙️💸 **Weak or pricey natural-language options**: A few tools support voice/chat, but they’re often **expensive**, and the experience is hit-or-miss.\n- 🔒📦 **Limited data ownership**: Records live on third-party servers, so **privacy and control** are diluted.\n\n## 📲 How This Workflow Fixes It\n- 💬 **Put the capture back where you already are**: Log expenses directly inside **Telegram** (or other channels) in a **familiar chat**—no new app to learn.\n- ⚡ **Ultra-low-friction, unstructured input**: Send **text**, a **voice note**, or a **receipt photo**—the flow extracts **amount · item · date**, supports multiple languages and relative dates, and can **split multiple expenses** from one message.\n- 🗂️📝 **Your data, your sheet**: Final records are written to **your own Google Sheet** (columnar fields or a JSON column). You keep **full control**.\n\n### 🔗 Demo Google Sheet: [click me](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18PmxJov2VszEtUlK3IB4Jfbm37hRQbS8D90SSscvoW8/edit?usp=drive_link)\n\n\n---\n\n## 👥 Who Is This For\n- 😤 **Anyone fed up with traditional bookkeeping** but curious about an AI-assisted, chat-based way to log expenses.\n- 🤖 **People who tried AI bookkeeping apps** but found them pricey, inflexible, or clunky.\n- 💵 **Bookkeeping beginners** who want frictionless capture first, simple review and categorize later.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 How It Works\n- 💬 Captures expenses from **Telegram** (text, voice note, or receipt photo).\n- 🔎 Normalizes inputs into **raw text** (uses Gemini to transcribe voice and extract text from images).\n- 🧠 Parses **amount · item · date** with an LLM expense parser.\n- 📊 Appends tidy rows to **Google Sheets**.\n- 🔔 Sends a **Telegram confirmation** summarizing exactly what was recorded.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to Set Up\n\n### 1) 🔑 Connect credentials (once)\n- TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\n- LLM_API_KEY\n- GOOGLE_SHEETS_OAUTH\n\n\n### 2) 🚀 Quick Start\n- **Setup:** Create a Google Sheet to store **Log Expense** data and configure it in n8n.\n- **Telegram:** Fill in and verify the **Telegram chatId**.\n- ***Remember enable the workflow!***\n\n---\n\n## 🧰 How to Customize the Workflow\n- 📝 **Other user interaction channels**: Add Gmail, Slack, or a website Webhook to accept email/command/form submissions that map into the same parser.\n- 🌍 **Currency**: Extract and store **`currency`** in its own column (e.g., `MYR`, `USD`); keep **`amount` numeric** only (no symbols).\n- 🔎 **Higher-accuracy OCR / STT to reduce errors**\n\n---\n\n### 📩 Help\n**Contact:** owenlzyxg@gmail.com\n",
