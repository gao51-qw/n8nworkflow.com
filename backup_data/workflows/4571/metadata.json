  "description": "Deadlock Match Stats Bot is an automated workflow for n8n designed to send detailed player statistics from the most recent Deadlock match directly to Telegram. When the user sends the /match command to the Telegram bot, the workflow performs the following steps:\n\nLoads the HTML content of the player's profile page from deadlocktracker.gg using a preconfigured Steam ID.\n\nExtracts the most recent match ID using a regular expression from the embedded JavaScript data.\n\nLoads the HTML page for the specified match.\n\nParses the match page using cheerio to extract relevant data for each player, including their nickname, selected hero, and current rank.\n\nFormats the collected information into a single message and sends it to the Telegram chat that issued the command.",
