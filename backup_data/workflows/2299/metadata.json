  "description": "## Purpose of the workflow\nMost scraping workflows get blocked by anti-bot technologies. To avoid this, you can use Scrappey to scrape every website you want.\n\n## How it works:\nWe use Test Data and make a API Call to the Scrappey service. \nWe get the scraped website data back as a result.\n\n\n## Setup Steps:\n- Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the \"Scrappey API Call\" node with your Scrappey API Key ([Register For Free](https://scrappey.com/?ref=n8n))\n- Replace the test data with your production data. You can plug in any type of data connector at this point of your workflow.\n",
