  "description": "**How it works:**\nThis project teaches you to create a personal AI assistant named Jackie that operates through Telegram. Jackie can summarize unread emails, check calendar events, manage Google Tasks, and handle both voice and text interactions. The assistant provides a comprehensive digital life management solution accessible via Telegram messaging.\n\n**Key Features:** \n- Supports hands-free voice interaction\n- Maintains conversation memory\n- Integrates with major Google services\n- Provides personalized assistance for email management, scheduling, and task organization\n\n**Step-by-step:**\nTelegram Trigger: \nThe workflow starts with a Telegram trigger that listens for incoming message events. The system determines if the incoming message is voice or text input.\n\nVoice Processing: \nIf a voice message is received, the workflow retrieves the voice file from Telegram and uses OpenAI's transcription API to convert speech to text.\n\nAI Assistant: The processed text (whether original text or transcribed voice) is passed to Jackie, the AI assistant powered by OpenRouter's language model.\n\n**Tools Integration:** \nJackie is equipped with several productivity tools:\n\nGet Email: Uses Gmail API to fetch unread emails from the inbox with sender, date, subject, and summary information\n\nGoogle Calendar: Retrieves calendar events for specified dates, filtering out irrelevant future events\n\nGoogle Tasks: Both creates new tasks and retrieves existing tasks from Google Tasks lists\n\n**API Keys Required:**\n- Telegram Bot API: Create a bot via @BotFather on Telegram to get your bot token\n- OpenAI API: Required for voice-to-text transcription \n- OpenRouter API: Powers the AI language model responses \n- Google OAuth2: Needed for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks integration\n\n\n**Response Generation:**\nThe AI formulates intelligent responses based on the gathered information, current date context, and conversation history, then sends the response back to the user via Telegram in Markdown format.\n",
