To enable this functionality, you must modify both the n8n and BrowserAct workflows.\n\n---\n### Requirements\n* **BrowserAct** API account for web scraping\n* **BrowserAct** n8n Community Node -&gt; ([n8n Nodes BrowserAct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-browseract-workflows))\n* **BrowserAct** templates named **“WooCommerce Inventory & Stock Synchronization”** and **“WooCommerce Product Data Reconciliation”**\n* **Google Sheets** credentials for the supplier list\n* **WooCommerce** credentials for product management\n* **Google Gemini** account for the AI Agent\n* **Slack** credentials for error alerts\n\n---\n\n### Need Help?\n* #### [How to Find Your BrowseAct API Key & Workflow ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDjoZWEsZlE)\n* #### [How to Connect n8n to Browseract](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoYMdJaRdcQ)\n* #### [How to Use & Customize BrowserAct Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPZHFUASncY)\n* #### [How to Use the BrowserAct N8N Community Node](https://youtu.be/j0Nlba2pRLU)\n\n---\n### Workflow Guidance and Showcase\n\n* #### [STOP Overselling!
