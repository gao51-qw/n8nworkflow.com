## Synchronize WooCommerce Inventory & Create Products with Gemini AI & BrowserAct

### This sophisticated n8n template automates **WooCommerce inventory management** by scraping supplier data, updating existing products, and intelligently creating new ones with AI-formatted descriptions.

This workflow is essential for e-commerce operators, dropshippers, and inventory managers who need to ensure their product pricing and stock levels are synchronized with multiple third-party suppliers, minimizing overselling and maximizing profit.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

### How it works
* The workflow is typically run by a **Schedule Trigger** (though a Manual Trigger is also shown) to check stock automatically.
* It reads a list of **suppliers** and their inventory page URLs from a central **Google Sheet**.
* The workflow **loops** through each supplier:
    * A **BrowserAct** node scrapes the current **stock and price** data from the supplier's inventory page.
    * A **Code** node parses this bulk data into individual product items.
    * It then **loops** through each individual product found.
* The workflow checks **WooCommerce** to see if the product already exists based on its name.
    * **If the product exists:** It proceeds to update the existing product's price and stock quantity.
    * **If the product DOES NOT exist:**
        * An **If** node checks if the missing product's category matches a predefined type (optional filtering).
        * If it passes the filter, a **second BrowserAct** workflow scrapes detailed product attributes from a dedicated product page (e.g., DigiKey).
        * An **AI Agent (Gemini)** transforms these attributes into a specific, styled **HTML table** for the product description.
        * Finally, the product is created in **WooCommerce** with all scraped details and the AI-generated description.
* **Error Handling:** Multiple **Slack** nodes are configured to alert your team immediately if any scraping task fails or if the product update/creation process encounters an issue.

**Note:** This workflow does not support image uploads for new products. To enable this functionality, you must modify both the n8n and BrowserAct workflows.
