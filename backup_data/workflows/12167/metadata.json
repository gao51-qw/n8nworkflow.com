  "description": "Reply Handling (Optional Extension)\n\nThis optional workflow handles email replies after availability options have been sent.\n\nIt extends the main scheduling flow by enabling two-way, email-based confirmation.\n\nWhat this extension does\n\nListens for user replies via Gmail\n\nNormalizes free-text replies into structured data\n\nDetects whether the user confirmed a proposed slot or requested alternatives\n\nAutomatically creates a Google Calendar event on confirmation\n\nSends a confirmation or follow-up email accordingly\n\nWhy this matters\n\nMost scheduling automations stop after sending availability.\nThis extension closes the loop by turning email replies into real actions —\nwithout requiring booking links or manual follow-ups.\n\nTypical reply examples\n\n1 → Confirms the suggested time and creates the calendar event\n\n2 → Requests alternative time slots and continues the scheduling flow\n\nWhen to use this\n\nEmail-first scheduling (no Calendly / booking pages)\n\nHigh-touch or human-like scheduling flows\n\nSales calls, interviews, consultations, internal meetings",
