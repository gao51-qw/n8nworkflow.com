Who's it for
This template is perfect for anyone struggling with habit consistency who wants a fun, engaging way to maintain daily routines. It's ideal for productivity enthusiasts, fitness beginners, remote workers, students, or anyone who loves gamification and RPG elements. If you've ever wished your daily tasks felt more like an adventure game, this workflow is for you.
How it works
The workflow runs automatically every morning at your chosen time (default: 6 AM) and transforms your daily habits into an RPG adventure:
1. Daily Trigger - Scheduled to run every morning
2. Player Stats Generation - Creates random level, XP, and streak data (in production, connect to a database)
3. Quest Generation - Assigns daily "quests" based on the day of week (weekday routines, weekend specials, Monday goals)
4. Quote Fetching - Gets a motivational quote from a free API
5. Achievement Processing - Checks for milestone achievements (7-day streak, 30-day streak, level 10)
6. Email Creation - Builds a beautiful HTML email with game-like design
7. Email Delivery - Sends the quest email via Gmail
8. Stats Logging - Records execution statistics
The system includes different habit sets for weekdays and weekends, random bonus quests, a rank system (D to SSS), achievement unlocks, and progress tracking with visual elements like progress bars.
