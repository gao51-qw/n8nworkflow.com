  "description": "## AI-Powered Personalized Email Nurturing\n\nThis workflow automates sending tailored onboarding and follow-up emails based on lead commitment levels. It's designed for **coaches, consultants, and service-based businesses** who want to personalize their outreach and nurture prospects more effectively.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Triggered by New Data**: The workflow automatically starts whenever a new row is added to your specified Google Sheet.\n2.  **Assess Commitment**: An **If node** checks the \"Commitment\" score from your Google Sheet data.\n    * If the commitment score is **8 or higher**, the lead is considered \"warm\" and receives a detailed onboarding email.\n    * If the commitment score is **below 8**, the lead is considered \"colder\" and receives a gentle nudge email.\n3.  **Craft Warm Email (for high commitment)**: For \"warm\" leads, an **OpenAI node** generates an aspirational and confident first-touch email. This email highlights their goals, introduces your flagship offers, and invites them to a 30-minute discovery call.\n4.  **Craft Colder Email (for lower commitment)**: For \"colder\" leads, a different **OpenAI node** generates an encouraging, non-pushy follow-up email. This email thanks them for sharing their goals, reinspires them with the ROI of personal branding, asks a reflective question, and offers a no-pressure Q&A session.\n5.  **Send Emails**: The appropriate **Gmail node** sends the personalized email to the lead.\n6.  **Record Activity**: Finally, the **Google Sheets node** appends the lead's information and details of the sent email to a separate \"Contacts\" sheet, keeping a clear record of all interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Google Sheet Structure\n\nYour primary Google Sheet (the one triggering the workflow) must have the following exact column headers:\n\n* **Email**\n* **First name**\n* **Last name**\n* **Phone number**\n* **Industry**\n* **Title**\n* **Three goals you wish to achieve this year**\n* **1-10 how commited are you to your goals**\n\nYour secondary Google Sheet (for appending contacts) must have these exact column headers:\n\n* **name**\n* **email**\n* **phone**\n* **industry**\n* **title**\n* **three goals**\n* **commitment**\n\n---\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\n1.  **Add Credentials**:\n    * In n8n, add your **OpenAI API key** via the **Credentials** menu.\n    * Connect your **Google account** via the **Credentials** menu for Google Sheets and Gmail access.\n\n2.  **Configure Google Sheets Trigger**:\n    * Select the **`Google Sheets Trigger`** node.\n    * Choose your **Google Sheets credential**, select your **spreadsheet**, and the **specific sheet name** that contains your incoming lead data.\n\n3.  **Configure Commitment Logic**:\n    * Select the **`Commitment ≥ 8?`** If node.\n    * The condition is set to `={{ $json['1-10 how commited are you to your goals'] }} &gt;= 8`. Ensure your Google Sheet column name for commitment matches exactly, including spacing and capitalization.\n\n4.  **Configure OpenAI Nodes**:\n    * Select both **`crafting warmer email`** and **`crafting colder email`** nodes.\n    * Choose your **OpenAI credential** from the dropdown.\n    * **Crucially**: In both nodes' **Messages** section, replace placeholder information with your actual **company name**, **founder name**, and any specific details about your **flagship offers** and **booking links** (`https://calendly.com/brandied/discovery`).\n\n5.  **Configure Gmail Nodes**:\n    * Select both **`Send warmer email`** and **`Send colder email`** nodes.\n    * Choose your **Gmail credential**.\n\n6.  **Configure Append Row in Sheet**:\n    * Select the **`Append row in sheet`** node.\n    * Choose your **Google Sheets credential**, select the **spreadsheet** and **sheet name** where you want to log sent emails (your \"Contacts\" sheet).\n    * Verify that the column mappings correctly align with the \"Google Sheet Structure\" for your secondary sheet.\n\n---\n\n## Customization Options 💡\n\n* **Commitment Threshold**: Adjust the number in the **`Commitment ≥ 8?`** If node to change what constitutes a \"warm\" lead (e.g., `gte 7` for a commitment score of 7 or higher).\n* **Email Content & Tone**: Modify the prompts in the **`crafting warmer email`** and **`crafting colder email`** OpenAI nodes to fine-tune the email tone, length, specific calls to action, or any other elements to better suit your brand voice and strategy.\n* **Follow-Up Cadence**: Instead of immediate sending, you could introduce a **Wait node** after the email crafting to space out follow-ups or integrate with an email sequence tool.\n* **CRM Integration**: Replace the final **Google Sheets node** with an integration to your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce) to automatically log these interactions and enrich lead profiles directly within your CRM.",
