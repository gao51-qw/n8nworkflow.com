  "description": "# Summarize YouTube Videos & Chat About Content with GPT-4o-mini via Telegram\n\n## Description\n\nThis n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing YouTube video transcripts and enables users to interact with the content through AI-powered question answering via Telegram. It leverages the GPT-4o-mini model to generate summaries and provide insights based on the video’s transcript.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Input**: The workflow starts by receiving a YouTube video URL. This can be submitted through:\n   - A Telegram chat message.\n   - A webhook (e.g., triggered by a shortcut on Apple devices).\n\n2. **Transcript Extraction**: The URL is processed to extract the video transcript using the custom `youtubeTranscripter` community node ([available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-youtube-transcription-kasha)). The transcript is concatenated into a single text and stored in a Google Docs document.\n\n3. **Summarization**: The GPT-4o-mini AI model analyzes the transcript and generates a structured summary, including:\n   - A general overview.\n   - Key moments.\n   - Instructions (if applicable).  \n   The summary is then sent back to the user via Telegram.\n\n4. **Interactive Q&A**: Users can ask questions about the video content via Telegram. The AI retrieves the stored transcript from Google Docs and provides accurate, context-based answers, which are sent back through Telegram.\n\n### Setup Instructions\n\nTo configure this workflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import the Workflow**: Download the provided JSON template and import it into your n8n instance.\n2. **Install the Community Node**: Install the `youtubeTranscripter` community node via npm:\n   ```bash\n   npm install n8n-nodes-youtube-transcription-kasha\n   ```\n   **Important**: This node requires a self-hosted n8n instance due to its external dependencies.\n3. **Configure Nodes**:\n   - **Webhook**: Set up the webhook to receive YouTube URLs. Alternatively, configure the Telegram node if using Telegram as the input method.\n   - **Google Docs**: Provide valid credentials to enable writing the transcript to a Google Docs document.\n   - **AI Model**: Set up the GPT-4o-mini model for summarization and Q&A functionality.\n4. **Test the Workflow**: Send a YouTube URL via your chosen input method (Telegram or webhook) and confirm that the summary is generated and delivered correctly.\n\n\n### Customization\n\n- **Language**: Adjust the AI prompts to generate summaries and answers in any desired language.\n- **Output Format**: Modify the summary structure by editing the prompt in the summarization node.\n- **Input Methods**: Replace the Telegram node with another messaging or input node to adapt the workflow to different platforms.\n\n### Who Can Benefit?\n\nThis template is perfect for:\n- **Content Creators**: Quickly summarize video content for repurposing or review.\n- **Students and Researchers**: Extract key insights from educational or informational videos efficiently.\n- **General Users**: Interact with video content via AI without needing to watch the full video.\n\n### Problem Solved\n\nThis workflow simplifies video content consumption by:\n- Automating the extraction and summarization of key points.\n- Enabling interactive Q&A to address specific questions without rewatching the video.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- **Disclaimer**: The `youtubeTranscripter` community node is required and only works on self-hosted n8n instances due to its reliance on external services.\n- **Apple Users**: Enhance your experience with a custom shortcut to share YouTube videos directly to the workflow.
