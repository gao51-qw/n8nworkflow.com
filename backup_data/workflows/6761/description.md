## Who’s it for  
Growth hackers, social-media managers, and brand builders who want to keep their Twitter (X) accounts active by automatically liking relevant posts on a set schedule—without manual scrolling.

## How it works / What it does  
1. **Schedule Trigger** runs every hour at a specified minute.  
2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating Twitter session-cookie (to stay under 1 000 likes/day).  
3. **AI Agent** generates a realistic AI/BPA-related hashtag.  
4. **Phantombuster Hashtag Agent** scrapes recent tweets for that hashtag → **Get Posts**.  
5. **Get Random Post** picks one tweet, checks it isn’t already liked (SharePoint CSV), and uploads a one-row `twitter_posts_to_like.csv`.  
6. **Phantombuster Autolike Agent** receives the CSV link and likes the tweet.  
7. The tweet URL is appended to `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv` to prevent duplicates.

## How to set up  
1. Create credentials: Phantombuster API key, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  
2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder add:  
   • `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv` (header `postUrl`).  
   • `twitter_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  
3. Adjust schedule if you need a different frequency.  
4. Activate the workflow—likes will start automatically.

## Requirements  
- n8n 1.33+

## How to customize  
- Change hashtag logic: edit the prompt in **AI Agent**.
