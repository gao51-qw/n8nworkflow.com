  "description": "## Who’s it for  \nGrowth hackers, social-media managers, and brand builders who want to keep their Twitter (X) accounts active by automatically liking relevant posts on a set schedule—without manual scrolling.\n\n## How it works / What it does  \n1. **Schedule Trigger** runs every hour at a specified minute.  \n2. **Select Cookie** chooses a rotating Twitter session-cookie (to stay under 1 000 likes/day).  \n3. **AI Agent** generates a realistic AI/BPA-related hashtag.  \n4. **Phantombuster Hashtag Agent** scrapes recent tweets for that hashtag → **Get Posts**.  \n5. **Get Random Post** picks one tweet, checks it isn’t already liked (SharePoint CSV), and uploads a one-row `twitter_posts_to_like.csv`.  \n6. **Phantombuster Autolike Agent** receives the CSV link and likes the tweet.  \n7. The tweet URL is appended to `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv` to prevent duplicates.\n\n## How to set up  \n1. Create credentials: Phantombuster API key, SharePoint OAuth2, OpenAI API key.  \n2. In SharePoint › “Phantombuster” folder add:  \n   • `twitter_posts_already_liked.csv` (header `postUrl`).  \n   • `twitter_session_cookies.txt` – one cookie per line.  \n3. Adjust schedule if you need a different frequency.  \n4. Activate the workflow—likes will start automatically.\n\n## Requirements  \n- n8n 1.33+  \n- Phantombuster Growth plan (API access)  \n- OpenAI account \n- Microsoft 365 SharePoint tenant\n\n## How to customize  \n- Change hashtag logic: edit the prompt in **AI Agent**.  \n- Increase daily likes: add more cookies or shorten `Wait` nodes.  \n- Swap SharePoint for Google Drive/Dropbox: replace the upload/download nodes.",
