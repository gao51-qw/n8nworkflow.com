This automation intelligently connects candidate profiles to job opportunities. It takes an intake form with a short summary, resume link, and optional LinkedIn profile, then enriches the data using Decodo and Gemini. The workflow analyzes skills, experience, and role relevance, ranks top matches, and emails a polished HTML report directly to your inbox—saving hours of manual review and matching effort.
