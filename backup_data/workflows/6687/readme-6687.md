# Sync Facebook/Google lead ads to Google Sheets & Salesforce CRM

> Stop wasting time on manual data entry and instantly engage with your new leads! This powerful and production-ready n8n workflow automates the entire process of capturing leads from **Facebook Lead Ads** (or **Google Ads Lead Forms**), creating a backup in **Google Sheets**, and adding them directly into your **CRM** like Salesforce.

This template is designed for marketers, sales teams, and agencies who want to ensure every lead is tracked and actioned immediately, improving conversion rates and maintaining a clean, organized database.

**How It Works**
This workflow follows a logical and robust sequence:

- **Instant Trigger**: The workflow instantly starts when a new lead is submitted on your connected Facebook Lead Ad form.
- **Smart Data Prep**: A **Set** node automatically processes the incoming data, intelligently splitting the 'full_name' field into 'First Name' and 'Last Name' to ensure compatibility with standard CRM fields.
- **Reliable Backup**: The lead details are immediately appended to a new row in a specified Google Sheet. This serves as a permanent, easy-to-access log of all your leads. A "Processing" status is added.
- **CRM Integration**: The formatted lead data is used to create a new **Lead** in Salesforce. This can be easily swapped for other CRMs like HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho, or any custom CRM with an API.
- **Status Confirmation**: After the lead is successfully created in the CRM, the workflow goes back to the Google Sheet and updates the lead's status from "Processing" to "Synced," giving you a clear, at-a-glance overview of your sync status.

**Key Features**
- **Multi-Platform Ready**: Primarily set up for Facebook Lead Ads, but the trigger can be easily swapped with the **Google Ads Lead Form Trigger** node for Google-based campaigns.
- **Data Integrity**: Includes a data preparation step to clean and structure information before sending it to your CRM.
- **Failsafe Logging**: Google Sheets integration ensures you never lose a lead, even if there's a temporary issue with your CRM.
- **Closed-Loop Reporting**: The status update feature provides clear confirmation within your spreadsheet that the automation was successful for each lead.
- **Highly Customizable**: Easily adapt the workflow to handle custom fields from your lead forms and map them to any field in your CRM.
