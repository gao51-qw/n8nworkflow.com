### 🖼️ Image-to-Image AI Generator from Google Sheets with Google Drive Upload
---

## ✅ Use Case

Automatically generate AI images from prompts listed in a Google Sheet, upload the images to Google Drive, and log the result back into the sheet.

Uses the [`image-to-image-gpt`](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/image-to-image-gpt) API  for fast, customizable generation.

---

## 💡 Problem It Solves

Manual image generation workflows are inefficient and error-prone. Creative and content teams often have to:
- Manually paste prompts into image generation tools
- Save images locally
- Upload to Google Drive
- Paste the link back into tracking spreadsheets

This automation removes all that friction—turning one spreadsheet into a complete image creation pipeline.

---

## 🌟 Benefits

- 🔁 Fully automated image generation
- 📤 Direct uploads to Google Drive
- 🧾 Image links and timestamps logged in Google Sheets
- ⚠️ Built-in error logging for API failures
- 🧩 Modular and easily extensible
- 📊 Keeps a historical log of successes and errors

| **3. Loop Over Items** | Processes one row (prompt) at a time |
| **4. If2** | Filters only rows where `Prompt` is not empty and `drive path` is empty |
| **5. HTTP Request1** | Calls the [`image-to-image-gpt`](https://rapidapi.com/PrineshPatel/api/image-to-image-gpt) API with the prompt |
| **6. If1 (Error Handling)** | If an error exists in the API response, route to logging |
| **7. Google Sheets4 (Error Log)** | Appends error details to a log sheet for review |
| **8. Code1** | Decodes the base64 image returned by the API |
| **9. Google Drive1** | Uploads the image to a selected Google Drive folder |
| **10. Google Sheets1 (Write Back)** | Updates the original row with the image drive path and timestamp |
| **11. Wait** | Delays the next prompt to prevent hitting API rate limits |
