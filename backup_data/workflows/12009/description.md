## 🎥 AI Content Generator: Transcript to Video & Image

### Transform meeting transcripts into engaging multi-format content with AI-powered automation

Perfect for educators, consultants, and content creators who record sessions and want to repurpose them into social media posts, videos, and images without manual work.

### How it works
* Chat interface triggers the AI orchestrator when you request content creation
* Fetches your most recent meeting transcript from Fathom
* AI analyzes the transcript and extracts key insights and breakthrough moments
* Generates written post content and creates a Google Doc automatically
* Creates detailed video generation prompts and sends to video API (Luma/Runway)
* Generates image prompts and creates social media graphics via DALL-E
* Returns all assets: written content, video URL, and image file ready to use

### How to use
* Connect your Fathom account to retrieve meeting transcripts
* Set up the three required subworkflows: Text to Video, Text to Image, and Transcript to Content
* Configure your OpenAI credentials for AI processing
* Simply chat: "Create content from my latest session - video and image"
* Review and customize the generated content as needed

### Requirements
* Fathom account with recorded meetings or sessions
* OpenAI API account (GPT-4 recommended for best results)
* Google Docs access for content storage
* Video generation API (Luma AI or Runway ML) for video creation
* Three subworkflows must be created separately (see setup notes)

### Good to know
* Video generation typically costs $0.50-$2.00 per video depending on your provider
* The workflow processes the most recent 7 days of Fathom transcripts automatically
* AI agents use ~5,000-10,000 tokens per complete content generation
* Subworkflows need to be set up once before using this main workflow
* Videos take 2-5 minutes to generate after the prompt is created
