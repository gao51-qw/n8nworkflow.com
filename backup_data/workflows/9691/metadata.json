  "description": "## **Try It Out!**\n\nThe **SOL/USDT Multi-Timeframe AI Market Analyzer and Trader with Telegram Approval** is your fully automated Solana trading assistant powered by **AI**, **AFK Crypto**, and **Telegram**.\n\nIt runs hourly by default, fetches real-time market data for the SOL/USDT pair, and uses AI-driven logic to determine optimal entry, exit, and risk management strategies. You receive a **Telegram approval message** that lets you confirm or reject the trade instantly. Once approved, the bot executes trades via your **AFK Crypto Wallet** and keeps monitoring for Take-Profit or Stop-Loss triggers — sending alerts directly to Telegram when they’re hit.\n\nThis system combines automation with manual oversight, giving you AI precision with human approval control.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\n1. **Hourly Trigger** – The workflow initiates every hour to analyze the current market status.\n2. **Fetch SOL Market Data (Crypto Compare)** – Retrieves multiple timeframe data (1m, 5m, 1h) for trend, momentum, and volatility analysis.\n3. **AI Market Analyzer** – Processes data through an AI agent to identify:\n\n   * Market sentiment (bullish, bearish, neutral)\n   * Recommended position: LONG / SHORT / HOLD\n   * Stop-Loss and Take-Profit levels\n   * Confidence rating and reasoning\n4. **Balance Check (AFK Crypto)** – Verifies wallet balance via `/v1/wallets/balances?chain=solana` and calculates position size based on 1% risk.\n5. **Telegram Approval Message** – Sends a Telegram message containing AI insights and trade details with “✅ Approve” or “❌ Decline” buttons.\n6. **Trade Execution (AFK Trade API)** – If approved, executes trade instantly via `/v1/trade/swap` using your AFK Crypto wallet.\n7. **Live Trade Monitoring** – Monitors SOL price in real-time. Once Take-Profit or Stop-Loss conditions are met:\n\n   * The position auto-closes.\n   * A Telegram notification is sent summarizing results and updated balance.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Use**\n\n1. **Import the workflow** into your n8n workspace.\n2. **Add your credentials:**\n\n   * **AFK Crypto API Key** – For balance and trading operations.\n   * **Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID** – For sending messages and approvals.\n   * **Crypto Compare API Key** – For fetching market data.\n3. **Edit “Fetch SOL Market Data” Node:**\n   Update the endpoint if you want different timeframes or markets.\n4. **Set the schedule:**\n   Default trigger = every hour (modifiable in the “Every Hour” node).\n5. **Deploy and activate.**\n   The bot will send you hourly market analyses via Telegram — allowing you to approve or skip each suggested trade.\n\n---\n\n### **(Optional) Extend This Workflow**\n\n* **Auto Mode:** Allow the AI to auto-trade when confidence &gt; 90%.\n* **Portfolio Sync:** Log every trade and PnL automatically to Notion or Airtable.\n* **Risk Adjuster:** Dynamically modify the 1% risk per trade based on balance or volatility.\n* **Multi-Pair Trading:** Expand to include ETH/USDT or BTC/USDT using the same logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Requirements**\n\n* **AFK Crypto Wallet + API Key**\n* **Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID**\n* **Crypto Compare API Key**\n* **n8n Instance** with HTTP Request, AI, and Telegram nodes enabled\n\n---\n\n### **AFK APIs Used**\n\n* `GET https://api.afkcrypto.com/v1/wallets/balances?chain=solana`\n* `POST https://api.afkcrypto.com/v1/trade/swap`\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe **SOL/USDT Multi-Timeframe AI Market Analyzer and Trader with Telegram Approval** workflow is an intelligent trading automation system that merges **AI analytics**, **Telegram decision prompts**, and **AFK Crypto execution**.\n\nIt empowers you to make data-driven trading decisions — with AI doing the heavy lifting and you retaining the final say before every trade.\nA perfect hybrid between automation and control, optimized for active Solana traders who value precision and security.\n\n---\n\n**Our Website**: https://afkcrypto.com/\n**Check our blogs**: https://www.afkcrypto.com/blog",
