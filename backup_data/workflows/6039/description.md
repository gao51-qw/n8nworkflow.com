2. **Supabase Sink**: Persists `email`, `linkedin_url`, and ingestion timestamp.  
3. **LinkedIn Enrichment**: Fetches career history and latest 5 posts via RapidAPI.  
4. **Data Validation**: Conditional nodes drop incomplete or irrelevant leads.  
5. **Product Description Agent**: Creates a customer profile based on the product and how it can help them.  
6. **Story Agent**: Has the persona, style of speech and rules to generate reply for the customer based on the pain points and solution found by the Product Description agent. 
7. **HTML Modifier**: Contains a fix format to keep the output format of each mail consistent and also generate a subject for the mail. 
8. **SendGrid Dispatch**: An SMTP service which delivers emails in large quantity and also keep your mail spam free otherwise if you use gmail node your mail will go staright to spam; updates `status=true/false` in Supabase.
