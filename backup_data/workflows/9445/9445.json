    "description": "## Overview\nTransform competitor Instagram content into optimized scripts for your own channel with this fully automated AI-powered content intelligence system. This workflow monitors Instagram profiles in your niche (AI/automation/tech), downloads their videos, transcribes the content, analyzes it for valuable tools and technologies, enriches it with web research, and rewrites it into polished, engagement-optimized scripts ready for your content team. It's like having a 24/7 content research team that never sleeps, turning competitor content into fresh opportunities for your channel.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n**🎯 Automated Competitive Intelligence** - Monitor unlimited Instagram profiles and automatically capture their latest content the moment they post, ensuring you never miss trending topics in your niche.\n\n**🤖 AI-Powered Content Analysis** - GPT-4O intelligently filters videos to identify only those discussing relevant tools, technologies, or AI solutions, saving hours of manual review time.\n\n**✍️ Professional Script Rewriting** - Automatically transforms competitor scripts into unique, high-quality content optimized for your brand voice with engagement-focused CTAs that drive comments and DMs.\n\n**🔍 Deep Research Integration** - Enriches every script with fresh facts from Perplexity AI's web search, adding unique insights and credibility that sets your content apart from simple reposts.\n\n**📊 Comprehensive Data Tracking** - Stores all video metadata (views, likes, comments, duration) alongside original and rewritten scripts for performance analysis and content strategy optimization.\n\n**⚡ Scalable Batch Processing** - Process multiple Instagram profiles in a single execution with built-in error handling, ensuring the workflow continues even if individual videos fail to process.\n\n**💰 Revenue-Generating Lead Magnet** - Built-in CTA system (\"comment [keyword] for the link\") creates engagement and captures leads directly into your DMs for monetization opportunities.\n\n**🔄 100% Repurposable Output** - Every processed video becomes a ready-to-use script with step-by-step guides, tool information, and engagement hooks perfect for reels, shorts, or TikToks.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Phase 1: Content Discovery & Extraction\nThe workflow begins by reading your curated list of Instagram profiles from a Google Sheet. These should be competitors or influencers in your niche (AI, automation, tech tools, etc.). For each profile, the system uses the Scrape Creators API to fetch their most recent post, specifically targeting video content. It extracts multiple video quality URLs and prepares them for download.\n\n### Phase 2: Video Processing & Transcription\nOnce a video is identified, the workflow downloads it directly from Instagram's servers using the highest quality version available. The video file is then passed to OpenAI's Whisper transcription model, which converts the audio into accurate text transcripts. This happens automatically even for videos with background music, multiple speakers, or accents.\n\n### Phase 3: Intelligent Content Filtering\nThe raw transcript is analyzed by GPT-4O using a sophisticated prompt that determines if the content is relevant to your niche. The AI identifies:\n- Whether the video discusses tools, technologies, or AI solutions (verdict: true/false)\n- Specific tool names mentioned\n- Step-by-step instructions for using the tools\n- A search query for additional research\n- Suggestions for making the content more engaging for an AI/automation audience\n\nIf the content isn't relevant, the workflow skips it and moves to the next profile, saving API costs and processing time.\n\n### Phase 4: Deep Research & Fact-Finding\nFor relevant content, the system automatically queries Perplexity AI using the generated search prompt. Perplexity searches the web in real-time to find three interesting, peculiar, or unique facts about the tool or technology. This adds depth and credibility to your final script that the original content likely didn't have.\n\n### Phase 5: Professional Script Rewriting\nThe final AI step combines everything: the original transcript, the step-by-step guide, the Perplexity research, and the improvement suggestions. GPT-4O rewrites the entire script in your brand voice (casual, spartan, straightforward) at approximately 100 words. The new script:\n- Opens with a strong hook\n- Presents the tool/technology clearly\n- Includes the researched facts naturally\n- Provides value-driven instructions\n- Ends with a specific CTA (e.g., \"Comment 'AI' and I'll send the link\")\n\n### Phase 6: Data Storage & Loop Execution\nAll data is written back to your Google Sheet including video metadata (ID, timestamp, caption, engagement metrics), the original transcript, and the rewritten script. The workflow then loops back to process the next Instagram profile in your list, continuing until all profiles have been processed.\n\n## Required Setup\n\n### Google Sheets Database\nCreate a Google Sheet with two tabs:\n1. **\"profiles\" tab** - Column: \"Instagram Handles\" (without @ symbol, e.g., \"aiautomationhub\")\n2. **\"phantom output\" tab** - Columns: id, timeStamp, caption, commentcount, videoUrl, likesCount, videoViewsCount, Username, Duration, original Script, rewritten Script, style, Updated\n\n### API Credentials Required\n- **Scrape Creators API** - For Instagram data extraction (handles, posts, videos)\n- **OpenAI API Key** - For Whisper transcription and GPT-4O script analysis/rewriting\n- **Perplexity API Key** - For real-time web research and fact-finding\n- **Google Sheets OAuth** - For reading profiles and writing processed data\n\n### Software Requirements\n- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)\n- Internet connection for API calls\n- Sufficient OpenAI credits (approximately $0.05-0.15 per video processed)\n\n## Business Use Cases\n\n**Content Creation Agencies** - Offer content repurposing services to clients, turning competitor research into ready-to-post scripts at scale.\n\n**Social Media Managers** - Monitor competitor content and generate fresh ideas for your own channels without manual research.\n\n**Course Creators** - Identify trending tools in your niche and create educational content around them before competitors do.\n\n**Affiliate Marketers** - Discover new tools to promote, complete with ready-made scripts and CTAs for lead generation.\n\n**SaaS Companies** - Track how competitors explain similar products and optimize your own messaging based on what works.\n\n**Newsletter Operators** - Find trending topics and tools to feature, with scripts easily adaptable to written content.\n\n## Revenue Potential\n\n**Direct Sales**: Sell this workflow template for $97-$297 depending on setup complexity and included support.\n\n**Subscription Service**: Offer managed content intelligence as a service at $197-$497/month, processing unlimited profiles for clients.\n\n**Agency Upsell**: Use this as a lead generation tool (the CTA system) to build an email/DM list, then sell content creation services at $500-$2,000 per client/month.\n\n**Course Integration**: Include as a bonus tool in a content creation course priced at $497-$997, increasing perceived value.\n\n**White-Label Licensing**: License to agencies for $997-$2,997 with white-label rights for their client base.\n\n**Time Savings ROI**: If a content team spends 2 hours per video on research and scripting at $50/hour, this workflow saves $100 per video. Processing 20 videos weekly = $104,000 annual savings.\n\n## Difficulty Level & Build Time\n\n**Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced\n- Requires understanding of API authentication\n- Needs basic JSON knowledge for data mapping\n- Involves prompt engineering for optimal AI outputs\n\n**Build Time**: 3-4 hours for experienced n8n users, 6-8 hours for beginners\n- Setup and API credential configuration: 1 hour\n- Node connection and data flow: 1-2 hours  \n- Prompt optimization and testing: 1-2 hours\n- Google Sheets schema creation: 30 minutes\n- End-to-end testing with real profiles: 1-2 hours\n\n**Maintenance**: Low - Occasional prompt tweaks as AI models evolve\n\n## Detailed Setup Steps\n\n1. **Create Google Sheets Database**\n   - Create new Google Sheet named \"Instagram Content Intelligence\"\n   - Add tab \"profiles\" with column \"Instagram Handles\"\n   - Add tab \"phantom output\" with all required columns (see schema above)\n   - Populate profiles tab with 5-10 Instagram handles in your niche\n\n2. **Obtain API Credentials**\n   - Sign up for Scrape Creators (https://scrapecreators.com) and get API key\n   - Create OpenAI account and generate API key with GPT-4O and Whisper access\n   - Sign up for Perplexity AI API (https://perplexity.ai) and get API key\n   - Connect Google Sheets via OAuth in n8n\n\n3. **Import Workflow to n8n**\n   - Copy the JSON workflow provided\n   - In n8n, click \"Import from File\" or paste JSON\n   - All nodes will appear but show credential errors\n\n4. **Configure Credentials**\n   - Click each node with a red error icon\n   - Add your respective API credentials (Scrape Creators, OpenAI, Perplexity, Google Sheets)\n   - Test each connection to ensure validity\n\n5. **Map Google Sheets**\n   - In \"Get row(s) in sheet1\" node, select your Google Sheet and \"profiles\" tab\n   - In \"Update Entries2\" node, select your Google Sheet and \"phantom output\" tab\n   - Verify column mappings match your sheet structure\n\n6. **Customize AI Prompts**\n   - Review \"Filter & Generate Suggestions\" prompt - adjust for your specific niche\n   - Review \"Write New Script\" prompt - modify tone, length, and CTA format to match your brand\n   - Test with sample transcripts to optimize output quality\n\n7. **Test with Single Profile**\n   - Add one Instagram handle to your profiles sheet\n   - Click \"Execute workflow\" manually\n   - Monitor each node's output to verify data flow\n   - Check that final script appears in Google Sheet\n\n8. **Scale to Multiple Profiles**\n   - Add 10-20 Instagram profiles to your sheet\n   - Run full workflow and monitor for errors\n   - Review output quality across different content types\n   - Adjust batch size if rate limits are hit\n\n9. **Set Up Scheduling (Optional)**\n   - Replace Manual Trigger with Schedule Trigger\n   - Set to run daily at optimal times (e.g., 6 AM when fresh posts exist)\n   - Enable error notifications to catch failures\n\n10. **Implement DM Automation (Advanced)**\n    - Connect Instagram API or tools like ManyChat\n    - Monitor comments for keywords from your CTA\n    - Auto-send tool links via DM to engaged users\n\n## Advanced Customization Options\n\n**Multi-Language Support**: Add language detection node and conditional branches for different script formats per language.\n\n**Engagement Scoring**: Implement scoring algorithm based on likes, comments, views to prioritize which videos to repurpose first.\n\n**Content Categorization**: Add classification layer to tag scripts by category (productivity tools, AI models, automation platforms) for better organization.\n\n**Thumbnail Analysis**: Integrate vision AI to analyze which thumbnail styles perform best and suggest designs for your repurposed content.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**: Add sentiment detection to understand emotional tone and adjust rewritten scripts to match or improve engagement potential.\n\n**A/B Script Variants**: Generate 2-3 script variations per video with different hooks/CTAs for split testing performance.\n\n**Competitor Trend Dashboard**: Build a connected dashboard showing trending tools, engagement patterns, and content gaps in your niche.\n\n**Auto-Publishing Integration**: Connect to Instagram API or scheduling tools to automatically post rewritten content with approval workflows.\n\n**Voice Cloning Integration**: Add ElevenLabs API to generate audio using your voice profile, making videos fully production-ready.\n\n**Multi-Platform Expansion**: Extend to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn by adjusting script length and platform-specific CTAs.",
