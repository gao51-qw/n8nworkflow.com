## How It Works

### Phase 1: Content Discovery & Extraction
The workflow begins by reading your curated list of Instagram profiles from a Google Sheet. These should be competitors or influencers in your niche (AI, automation, tech tools, etc.). For each profile, the system uses the Scrape Creators API to fetch their most recent post, specifically targeting video content. It extracts multiple video quality URLs and prepares them for download.

### Phase 2: Video Processing & Transcription
Once a video is identified, the workflow downloads it directly from Instagram's servers using the highest quality version available. The video file is then passed to OpenAI's Whisper transcription model, which converts the audio into accurate text transcripts. This happens automatically even for videos with background music, multiple speakers, or accents.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Content Filtering
The raw transcript is analyzed by GPT-4O using a sophisticated prompt that determines if the content is relevant to your niche. The AI identifies:
- Whether the video discusses tools, technologies, or AI solutions (verdict: true/false)
- Specific tool names mentioned
- Step-by-step instructions for using the tools
- A search query for additional research
- Suggestions for making the content more engaging for an AI/automation audience

If the content isn't relevant, the workflow skips it and moves to the next profile, saving API costs and processing time.

### Phase 4: Deep Research & Fact-Finding
For relevant content, the system automatically queries Perplexity AI using the generated search prompt. Perplexity searches the web in real-time to find three interesting, peculiar, or unique facts about the tool or technology. This adds depth and credibility to your final script that the original content likely didn't have.

### Phase 5: Professional Script Rewriting
The final AI step combines everything: the original transcript, the step-by-step guide, the Perplexity research, and the improvement suggestions. GPT-4O rewrites the entire script in your brand voice (casual, spartan, straightforward) at approximately 100 words. The new script:
- Opens with a strong hook
- Presents the tool/technology clearly
- Includes the researched facts naturally
- Provides value-driven instructions
- Ends with a specific CTA (e.g., "Comment 'AI' and I'll send the link")

### Phase 6: Data Storage & Loop Execution
All data is written back to your Google Sheet including video metadata (ID, timestamp, caption, engagement metrics), the original transcript, and the rewritten script. The workflow then loops back to process the next Instagram profile in your list, continuing until all profiles have been processed.

## Required Setup

### Google Sheets Database
Create a Google Sheet with two tabs:
1. **"profiles" tab** - Column: "Instagram Handles" (without @ symbol, e.g., "aiautomationhub")
2. **"phantom output" tab** - Columns: id, timeStamp, caption, commentcount, videoUrl, likesCount, videoViewsCount, Username, Duration, original Script, rewritten Script, style, Updated

### API Credentials Required
- **Scrape Creators API** - For Instagram data extraction (handles, posts, videos)
- **OpenAI API Key** - For Whisper transcription and GPT-4O script analysis/rewriting
- **Perplexity API Key** - For real-time web research and fact-finding
- **Google Sheets OAuth** - For reading profiles and writing processed data

### Software Requirements
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Internet connection for API calls
- Sufficient OpenAI credits (approximately $0.05-0.15 per video processed)

## Business Use Cases
