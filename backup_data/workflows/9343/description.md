# iOS App Store Review Monitor & Notifier – Automated User Feedback Tracking

This workflow runs on a scheduled basis (default: every 6 hours, customizable) and **monitors new App Store reviews for your iOS apps.** It fetches reviews via Apple’s iTunes RSS API, filters only new reviews since the last run and sends **real-time notifications** to your team via email, Slack, Telegram or other channels.

Never miss important user feedback again.

## Who’s it for
- **iOS developers** tracking user sentiment and bug reports.
- Product managers monitoring **customer satisfaction** and feature requests.
- Customer support teams responding quickly to complaints and issues.
- Marketing teams collecting testimonials and case studies from positive reviews.
- DevOps teams automating review monitoring as part of release processes.

## How it works
- **Schedule Trigger** runs every 6 hours (cron configurable).
- **App Configuration:** Define monitored apps with {appId, country, lang}.
- **Fetch Reviews:** Call Apple’s iTunes RSS API for latest customer reviews.
- **Extract & Parse:** Convert JSON into structured review data (rating, content, author, date, version).
- **Filter New Reviews:** Compare with last run using timestamps → only new reviews pass.
- **Format Notifications:** Build rich messages with review details.
- **Send Alerts:** Deliver via Email, Slack, Telegram, Teams, etc.
- **Track State:** Last check time to prevent duplicates.

## How to set up
1. **Find your App Store ID**

Go to your app’s App Store page.

**Example URL:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/app-name/id123456789

The number after id is the App Store ID (123456789).

2. **Configure App Settings**

In the App Config node set:

appId = App Store ID
country = Country code (us, gb, de, etc.)
lang = Language code (en, es, fr, etc.)

3. **Set Up Notifications**

Choose your notification method:

**Email:** configure Gmail/SMTP credentials
**Slack:** add Slack webhook URL
**Telegram:** set up bot token + chat ID
**Teams:** configure Teams webhook

4. **Customize Schedule**

In the Schedule Trigger node:

Every 6 hours → 0 */6 * * *
Daily at 9 AM → 0 9 * * *
Every 2 hours → 0 */2 * * *

5. **Test the Workflow**

Use a known App ID (e.g., WhatsApp: 310633997) for testing.

Run manually to verify notifications are formatted correctly.

## Requirements

- n8n (cloud or self-hosted) with HTTP Request + notification nodes.
- **App Store ID** for each monitored app.
- Notification credentials (Email, Slack, Telegram, etc.).
- Internet access to query Apple’s iTunes API.

## How to customize the workflow

- **Multiple Apps**
- **Monitor multiple apps by extending config:**
[
{appId: "310633997", country: "us", lang: "en"},
{appId: "389801252", country: "gb", lang: "en"},
{appId: "544007664", country: "de", lang: "de"}
]
- **Notification Templates**

## Add-ons to level up

- **Sentiment Analysis:** AI-based scoring per review.
- **Auto-Reply Integration:** Respond via App Store Connect API.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Store in Sheets/Airtable for trends.
- **Competitor Monitoring:** Track rival app reviews.
- **Translation:** Auto-translate to English.
- **Escalation Rules:** Different alerts by rating severity.

## Common Troubleshooting

- **No reviews returned** → app may not have recent reviews, try other country codes.
- **JSON parsing errors** → check App Store ID validity.
- **Duplicate notifications** → confirm time filtering works correctly.
- **API rate limits** → Apple may throttle, add delays.
- **Missing metadata** → some apps don’t return all fields.
