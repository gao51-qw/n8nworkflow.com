# **🤖 AI-Powered Twitter Content Generator**

Transform topic ideas into ready to post Twitter drafts (text + image) using fresh web data and AI agents

## **🎯 What does this workflow do?**

This end to end automation creates complete Twitter posts by:

Taking your topic input (e.g., "Agentic AI") via chat interface

Generating fresh, research-backed content using AI agents:

First agent uses GPT-4.1-MINI + Tavily to bypass LLM knowledge limits with real-time web data

Second agent creates optimized prompt for image generation

Producing custom visuals through OpenAI's gpt-image-1

Delivering polished drafts (text + image) via Gmail for review

User input: You provide a topic through chat node

Content research:

Agent 1 (GPT-4.1-mini + Tavily) researches current web data

HTTP request node calls OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model to generate the image

Convert to file node converst the base64 string to a file so we can send it as an attachment
