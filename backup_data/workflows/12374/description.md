#### This n8n template demonstrates how to capture website leads via a webhook, validate the data, optionally enrich it, store it in your CRM (HubSpot) or a simple Google Sheet, and instantly notify your team via email and Slack.
This is ideal for agencies, freelancers, SaaS founders, and small sales teams who want every lead recorded and followed up automatically within seconds.

#### Good to know
- The workflow supports two storage options: HubSpot or Google Sheets (choose one branch).
- Enrichment (Clearbit/Hunter) is optional and can be disabled with a single toggle/IF branch.
- Consider adding anti-spam (honeypot/captcha) if your form gets abused.

#### How it works
1. **Webhook receives the lead**
Your website form sends a POST request to the Webhook URL with lead fields (name, email, message, etc.).
2. **Validation & normalization**
The workflow trims and normalizes fields (like lowercasing email) and checks required fields. If invalid, it returns a ```400 response code``` immediately.
3. **Optional enrichment (Clearbit/Hunter)**
If enrichment is enabled, the workflow calls an enrichment API and merges results into the lead object (industry, company size, domain, etc.).
If enrichment fails, the workflow continues (doesn’t block lead capture).
4. **Save lead to CRM (Choose one)**
- **HubSpot branch**: find contact by email → create or update the contact record
- **Google Sheets branch**: lookup row by email → update if found → otherwise append a new row
5. **Instant notifications**
Posts a Slack message to a channel, optionally including a CRM/Sheet link
6. **Success response to the website**
Returns a ```200 response``` ```{ ok: true }``` so your website can show a “Thanks!” message.
