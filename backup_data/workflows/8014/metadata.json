  "description": "### ⚙️ Sales Assistant Build: Automate Prospect Research and Personalized Outreach for Sales Calls\n\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Steps to Connect:\n\n1. **Google Sheets Setup**\n    - Connect your Google account via OAuth2 in the \"Review Calls\", \"Product List\", \"Testimonials Tool\", \"Update Sheet\", and \"Update Sheets 2\" nodes.\n    - Duplicate the mock Google Sheet (ID: `1u3WMJwYGwZewW1IztY8dfbEf5yBQxVh8oH7LQp4rAk4`) to your drive and update the `documentId` in all Google Sheets nodes to match your copy's ID.\n    - Ensure the sheet has tabs for \"Meeting Data\", \"Products\", and \"Success Stories\" populated with your data.\n    - Setup time: ~5 minutes.\n\n2. **OpenAI API Key**\n    - Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and generate your API key.\n    - Paste this key into the credentials for both \"OpenAI Chat Model\" and \"OpenAI Chat Model1\" nodes.\n    - Setup time: ~2 minutes.\n\n3. **Tavily API Key**\n    - Sign up at [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) and get your API key.\n    - In the \"Tavily\" node, replace the placeholder `api_key` in the JSON body with your key (e.g., `\"api_key\": \"your-tavily-key-here\"`).\n    - Setup time: ~3 minutes.\n\n---\n\n### How it Works\n• Triggers on a new sales call booking (manual for testing).  \n• Pulls prospect details from Google Sheets and researches their company, tech stack, and updates using Tavily.  \n• Matches relevant products/solutions from your product list and updates the sheet.  \n• Generates personalized email confirmation (subject + body) and SMS using testimonials for relevance.  \n• Updates the sheet with the outreach content for easy follow-up.\n\nSetup takes ~10-15 minutes total. All nodes are pre-configured—edit only the fields above. Detailed notes (e.g., prompt tweaks) are in sticky notes within the workflow.\n\n---\n",
