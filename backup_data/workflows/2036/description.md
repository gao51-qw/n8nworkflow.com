This node is designed to cleanse URLs and extract their domain names efficiently. 

It effectively handles a wide range of URL formats, including those with unconventional or complex top-level domains (TLDs), such as 'co.uk'.

You can also use it to extract the domain from an email. The node will also check if the domain is from a free email provider (gmail.com / outlook.com...etc) or not.

### How It Works

It then identifies and extracts the domain name, ensuring compatibility with a diverse array of TLDs.

The node utilizes an extensive list of TLDs to guarantee accurate domain extraction for virtually any URL.
