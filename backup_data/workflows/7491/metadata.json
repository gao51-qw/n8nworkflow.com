  "description": "## Description\n\nThis n8n template automates **prospect research** and **personalized follow-up writing** right after a sales call is booked.\n\nIt gathers **company background, tech stack, and updates**; suggests **relevant solutions**; and then drafts a **handcrafted email, subject line, and SMS**, all saved back into Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n## Benefits\n\n* Always show up to calls with **prepared context**.\n* Ensure **no follow-up slips through the cracks**.\n* Keep all notes, research, and outreach in a **single system of record**.\n* Scale personalized outreach without losing the **human touch**.\n\n---\n\n## Use cases\n\n* Prep for sales calls with **richer prospect context**.\n* Save hours writing **personal follow-ups**.\n* Keep sales records neatly in **one shared sheet**.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Google Sheets with:\n\n  * **Meeting Data** → prospect info + enrichment fields\n  * **Success Stories** → testimonials (company, industry, results, solution used)\n* Tavily API key\n* OpenAI API key (GPT-4.1 or later recommended)\n* n8n account with Google Sheets + LangChain enabled\n\n---\n\n## Google Sheets Template\n\nYou’ll need **two sheets** inside one Google Spreadsheet:\n\n### 1. Meeting Data (input + output)\n\nColumns:\n\n* `Name`\n* `Email`\n* `Company`\n* `Website`\n* `Job Title`\n* `Meeting Date`\n* `Company Overview` (AI-filled)\n* `Tech Stack` (AI-filled)\n* `Company Updates` (AI-filled)\n* `Primary Solution` (AI-filled)\n* `Solution 2` (AI-filled)\n* `Solution 3` (AI-filled)\n* `Email Subject` (AI-filled)\n* `Follow-up Email` (AI-filled)\n* `Follow-up SMS` (AI-filled)\n\n### 2. Success Stories (for testimonials)\n\nColumns:\n\n* `Company`\n* `Industry`\n* `Results`\n* `Solution Used`\n\nYou can copy this structure into a fresh Google Spreadsheet before starting.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Trigger** → Pulls new rows from Google Sheets (or connects to your booking system).\n2. **Research Agent** → Uses Tavily for company overview, tech stack, and updates.\n3. **Product Suggestions** → Pulls from Product List sheet to propose 3 tailored solutions.\n4. **Save Research** → Updates the row with the six research fields.\n5. **Sales Writing Assistant** → Drafts subject, email, and SMS using context + testimonials.\n6. **Update Sheet** → Writes final outputs (subject, email, SMS) into Google Sheets.\n\n---\n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1. **Prepare Google Sheets**\n\n   * Create a new spreadsheet with the **Meeting Data** and **Success Stories** tabs.\n   * Add the required columns (see template above).\n   * Fill in at least one success story for the workflow to use.\n\n2. **Connect Google Sheets in n8n**\n\n   * Add Google Sheets credentials under **Settings → Credentials**.\n   * Make sure n8n has access to your spreadsheet.\n\n3. **Add API Keys**\n\n   * In n8n, create credentials for **OpenAI** (GPT-4.1 or later).\n   * Create credentials for **Tavily**.\n\n4. **Import the workflow**\n\n   * Load the JSON file (this template) into n8n.\n   * Replace any placeholder spreadsheet IDs with your own.\n   * Map the correct sheet/tab names.\n\n5. **Test the Research Agent**\n\n   * Run the workflow manually.\n   * Check that `Company Overview`, `Tech Stack`, and `Company Updates` populate.\n\n6. **Test the Writing Assistant**\n\n   * Ensure the workflow uses at least one testimonial from **Success Stories**.\n   * Run it again and confirm `Email Subject`, `Follow-up Email`, and `SMS` are written.\n\n7. **Automate**\n\n   * Replace the **Manual Trigger** with your preferred trigger:\n\n     * Google Calendar / Calendly → Google Sheets\n     * CRM → Google Sheets\n     * Directly from n8n integrations\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\nThis workflow is designed as a flexible foundation. Here are ways to adapt it:\n\n* **Change AI prompts**\n\n  * Update the **Research Agent** prompt to focus on specific industries or data points.\n  * Edit the **Sales Writing Assistant** to match your tone of voice.\n\n* **Swap success stories**\n\n  * Add more detailed case studies to the **Success Stories** sheet for stronger personalization.\n\n* **Add integrations**\n\n  * Send follow-up emails automatically with **Gmail** or **Outlook** nodes.\n  * Push SMS directly via **Twilio**.\n  * Sync enriched data into **HubSpot, Salesforce, or Notion**.\n\n* **Error handling**\n\n  * Add retry logic for API calls.\n  * Include a notification node (Slack/Email) if the workflow fails.\n\n---\n\n## Tips & Troubleshooting\n\n* If research doesn’t update → confirm **Email** is the matching column in your Update Sheet nodes.\n* If follow-up copy is blank → ensure at least one testimonial exists in **Success Stories**.\n* Use **Debug Mode** to inspect AI Agent or Sales Writing Assistant outputs.\n\n---\n\n \n",
