### This workflow automates bulk price updates for Magento 2 products using data from a Google Sheet. It reads SKUs and new prices, cleans and validates the data, and updates each product via the Magento 2 REST API. 

Error messages from failed updates are parsed and logged clearly, making it easy to monitor and correct issues directly from the spreadsheet. Ideal for store managers and merchandisers who need a faster, error-resistant alternative to manual updates in the admin panel.
