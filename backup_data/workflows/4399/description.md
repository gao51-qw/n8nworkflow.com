This workflow dynamically chooses between two new powerful Anthropic models — **Claude Opus 4** and **Claude Sonnet 4** — to handle user queries, based on their complexity and nature, maintaining scalability and context awareness with Anthropic **web search function** and **Think** tool.

---

###  **Key Advantages**

1. **🔁 Dynamic Model Selection**

   * Automatically routes each user query to either **Claude Sonnet 4** (for routine tasks) or **Claude Opus 4** (for complex reasoning), ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

2. **🧠 AI Agent with Tool Use**

   * The AI agent can utilize a **web search tool** to retrieve up-to-date information and a **Think tool** for complex reasoning processes — improving response quality.

3. **📎 Memory Integration**

   * Uses session-based **memory** to maintain conversational context, making interactions more coherent and human-like.

4. **🧮 Built-in Calculation Tool**

   * Handles numeric queries using an integrated **calculator tool**, reducing the need for external processing.

5. **📤 Structured Output Parser**

   * Ensures outputs are always well-structured and formatted in JSON, which improves consistency and downstream integrations.

6. **🌐 Web Search Capability**

   * Supports real-time information retrieval for current events, statistics, or details not available in the AI’s base knowledge.

###  Components Overview

* **Trigger**: Listens for new chat messages.
* **Routing Agent**: Analyzes the message and returns the best model to use.
* **AI Agent**: Handles the conversation, decides when to use tools.
* **Tools**:

  * `web_search` for internet queries
  * `Think` for reasoning
  * `Calculator` for math tasks
* **Models Used**:

  * `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`: Optimized for general and business logic tasks.
  * `claude-opus-4-20250514`: Best for deep, strategic, and analytical queries.

### **How It Works**
1. **Dynamic Model Selection**  
   - The workflow begins when a chat message is received. The **Anthropic Routing Agent** analyzes the user's query to determine the most suitable model (either **Claude Sonnet 4** or **Claude Opus 4**) based on the query's complexity and requirements.  
   - The routing agent uses predefined criteria to decide:  
     - **Claude Sonnet 4**: Best for standard tasks like real-time workflow routing, data validation, and routine business logic.  
     - **Claude Opus 4**: Reserved for complex scenarios requiring deep reasoning, advanced analysis, or high-impact decisions.  

2. **Query Processing and Response Generation**  
   - The selected model processes the query, leveraging tools like **web_search** for real-time information retrieval, **Think** for internal reasoning, and **Calculator** for numerical tasks.  
   - The **AI Agent** coordinates these tools, ensuring the response is accurate and context-aware. A **Simple Memory** node retains session context for coherent multi-turn conversations.  
   - The final response is formatted and returned to the user without intermediate steps or metadata.

### **Set Up Steps**
1. **Node Configuration**  
   - **Trigger**: Configure the *"When chat message received"* node to handle incoming user queries.  
   - **Routing Agent**: Set up the *"Anthropic Routing Agent"* with the system message defining model selection logic. Ensure it outputs a JSON object with `prompt` and `model` fields.  
   - **AI Model Nodes**: Link the *"Sonnet 4 or Opus 4"* node to dynamically use the selected model. The *"Sonnet 3.7"* node powers the routing agent itself.  

2. **Tool Integration**  
   - Attach the *"web_search"* HTTP tool to enable internet searches, ensuring the API endpoint and headers (e.g., `anthropic-version`) are correctly configured.  
   - Connect auxiliary tools (*Think*, *Calculator*) to the *"AI Agent"* for extended functionality.  
   - Add the *"Simple Memory"* node to maintain conversation history.  

3. **Credentials**  
   - Provide an **Anthropic API key** to all nodes requiring authentication (e.g., model nodes, web search).  

4. **Testing**  
   - Activate the workflow and test with sample queries to verify:  
     - Correct model selection (e.g., Sonnet for simple queries, Opus for complex ones).  
     - Proper tool usage (e.g., web searches trigger when needed).  
     - Memory retention across chat turns.  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Once validated, set the workflow to **active** for live interactions.
