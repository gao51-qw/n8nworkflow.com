## **Who is this for?**

  

This **n8n workflow template** is designed for **customer support**, **CX**, and **ops teams** that manage customer messages through HubSpot and use Jira for internal task management. It is especially useful for SaaS companies aiming to automate ticket triage, sentiment detection, and team assignment using **AI agents**.

## **🧩 What problem is this workflow solving?**

  

Customer service teams often struggle with manual message classification, delayed reactions to churn signals, and inefficiencies in routing support issues to the right internal teams. This workflow uses **LLMs** and **automated profiling** to:

- Detect churn risk or intent in customer messages
    
- Summarize issues
    
- Classify tickets into categories (e.g. fulfillment, technical, invoicing)
    
- Automatically create **Jira tickets** based on enriched insights

## **🤖 What this workflow does**

  

This AI-powered workflow processes HubSpot support tickets and routes them to Jira based on sentiment and topic. Here’s the full breakdown:

1. **Triggers**: Either manually or on a schedule (via cron).
    
2. **Fetch HubSpot tickets**: Retrieves new messages and their metadata.
    
3. **Run Orchestration Agent**:
    
    - Uses **Sentinel Agent** to detect **emotional tone**, **churn risk**, and **purchase intent**.
        
    - Calls **Profiler Agent** to enrich customer profiles from HubSpot.
        
    - Summarizes the message using OpenAI.
        
    - Classifies the ticket using a custom classifier (technical, fulfillment, etc.).
        
    
4. **Generate a Jira ticket**:
    
    - Title and description are generated using GPT.
        
    - The assignee and project are predefined.
        
    
5. **AI agents can be expanded** (e.g. add Guide or Facilitator agents).

## **🛠️ How to customize this workflow to your needs**
