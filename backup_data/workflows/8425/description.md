## ⚙️ How It Works

The workflow is triggered by messages sent to your Telegram bot. A central **Command Router** (`Switch` node) determines the user's intent and directs the flow to the appropriate tool.

### 1. Command Routing
*   A **Telegram Trigger** node listens for any new message.
*   The **Command Router** (`Switch` node) immediately inspects the message text for keywords like `/list`, `/select`, `/create`, etc.
*   Based on the command, the workflow branches into either a simple data fetch or a more complex AI-powered action.

### 2. Simple Recipe Lookups (`/list` & `/select`)
*   **`/list`:**
    1.  The **Read Recipe Names** (`Google Sheets` node) fetches all values from column A of your sheet.
    2.  A **Format List Message** (`Code` node) transforms the raw data into a clean, numbered list.
    3.  The formatted list is sent to you via the **Telegram Send Recipe List** node.
*   **`/select [recipe name]`:**
    1.  The **Extract Select Param** (`Code` node) isolates the recipe name from your command.
    2.  The **Lookup Recipe Row** (`Google Sheets` node) searches for that specific recipe in your sheet and returns its full row of data.
    3.  A **Format Full Recipe** (`Code` node) assembles the data into a beautifully formatted recipe card, complete with emojis and sections for ingredients, instructions, and notes.
    4.  The final recipe card is sent via the **Telegram Send Full Recipe** node.

### 3. AI-Powered Recipe Management (`/search`, `/create`, `/modify`)
For more complex tasks, the workflow leverages a powerful AI agent.

*   The user's command (e.g., `/search chicken and rice` or `/create a pasta dish`) is passed to the **Recipe AI Agent**.
*   This agent is powered by either **Google Gemini** or an **OpenAI Model**.
*   It is given a specific **system prompt** to act as a helpful, food-focused assistant with access to a set of tools.
*   **Tools Available to the AI:**
    *   **Read Recipes Sheet:** Allows the AI to read the entire Google Sheet to answer broad questions or find recipes based on ingredients.
    *   **Update Recipes Sheet:** Gives the AI the power to add new rows (new recipes) or modify existing ones based on your conversation.
    *   **Think:** A tool that allows the agent to process complex requests step-by-step before acting.
*   **Conversation Memory:** The agent remembers the last few messages, allowing you to have a natural, back-and-forth conversation (e.g., "Create a new recipe" -&gt; "What should it be called?" -&gt; "Spicy Tacos").
*   The AI's final, formatted response is sent back to you via the **Telegram Send AI Response** node.

## 🛠️ Setup Steps & Credentials

1.  **Telegram Bot:**
    *   Create a bot with `@BotFather` on Telegram to get your API token.
    *   Add this token as a credential for the **Telegram Trigger** and all **Telegram** sender nodes.

2.  **Google Sheets:**
    *   Create a new Google Sheet.
    *   Set up the first row with headers: `Recipe Name`, `Cooking Time`, `Ingredients`, `Instructions`, `Notes`.
    *   Copy the **Sheet ID** from the URL (it's the long string of characters in the middle).
    *   Paste the Sheet ID into the relevant fields in the **Read Recipe Names**, **Lookup Recipe Row**, and the **Google Sheets Tools** (`Read Recipes Sheet`, `Update Recipes Sheet`).
    *   Create Google OAuth2 credentials and connect them to all `Google Sheets` and `Google Sheets Tool` nodes.

3.  **AI Provider (Choose One):**
    *   **For Google Gemini:** Get an API key from Google AI Studio, create a `Google Gemini(PaLM) Api` credential, and connect it to the **Google Gemini Chat Model** node.
    *   **For OpenAI:** Get an API key from OpenAI, create an `OpenAI` credential, and connect it to the **OpenAI Chat Model** node.
    *   *Note:* You only need to enable one of the two AI models.

## 💡 Customization & Learning

*   **Expand Your Database:** Add more columns to your Google Sheet like `Cuisine`, `Difficulty`, or `Rating`, and modify the **Format Full Recipe** node to display them.
*   **Enhance the AI:** Edit the system prompt in the **Recipe AI Agent** to change its personality or give it more specific instructions.
*   **Add New Tools:** Create new tools for the AI agent, such as a function to fetch nutritional information from an external API based on ingredients.
*   **Different Triggers:** Instead of a Telegram bot, you could trigger the `/create` function from a simple web form.
