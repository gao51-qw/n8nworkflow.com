## Find & Qualify Funded Leads with BrowserAct & Gemini

### This n8n template helps you find new investment leads by automatically scraping articles for funding announcements and analyzing them with an AI Agent.

This workflow is ideal for venture capitalists, sales teams, or market researchers who need to automatically track and compile lists of recently funded companies.

### **Self-Hosted Only** 
This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for **self-hosted n8n instances** only.

---
### How it works
* The workflow is triggered **manually** but can be set to a **Cron** node to run on a schedule.
* A **Google Sheet** node loads a list of keywords (e.g., "Series A," "Series B") and geographic locations to search for.
* The workflow loops through each keyword, initiating **BrowserAct** web scraping tasks to collect relevant articles.
* A second set of **BrowserAct** nodes patiently monitors the scraping jobs, waiting for them to complete before proceeding.
* Once all articles are collected, they are merged and fed into an **AI Agent** node, powered by **Google Gemini**.
* The AI Agent processes the articles to identify companies that recently received funding, extracting the **Company Name**, the **Field of Investment**, and the source **URL**.
* A **Code** node transforms the AI's JSON output into a clean, itemized format.
* An **If** node filters out any entries where no company was found, ensuring data quality.
* The qualified leads are automatically added or updated in a **Google Sheet**, matching by "Company" to prevent duplicates.
* Finally, a **Slack** message is sent to a channel to notify your team that the lead list has been updated.
