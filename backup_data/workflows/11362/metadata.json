  "description": "## 🚀 Turn your random ideas into concrete automation specs\n\nThis workflow acts as your **interactive \"n8n Consultant.\"** Simply write down a rough automation idea in **Google Tasks** (e.g., \"Send weather updates to Telegram\"), and the AI will research, design, and send a detailed n8n implementation plan to your **Slack**.\n\n**✨ Why is this workflow special?**\nUnlike simple notification workflows, this features a **Human-in-the-Loop** review process. You don't just get a message; you get control.\n\n- **Regenerate:** Not satisfied with the AI's plan? Click a button in Slack to have the AI rewrite it instantly.\n- **Archive:** Happy with the plan? Click \"Approve\" to automatically save the detailed specs to **Google Sheets** and mark the task as complete.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Fetch:** The workflow periodically checks a specific Google Tasks list for new ideas.\n2. **AI Design:** The AI (OpenAI) analyzes your idea and generates a structured plan, including node configuration and potential pitfalls.\n3. **Human Review:** It sends the plan to Slack with interactive **\"Approve\"** and **\"Regenerate\"** buttons. The workflow waits for your input.\n    - **If Regenerate:** The AI re-analyzes the idea and creates a new variation.\n    - **If Approve:** The workflow proceeds to the next step.\n4. **Archive:** The approved plan (Title, Nodes, Challenges) is saved to a Google Sheet for future development.\n5. **Close:** The original Google Task is updated with a \"Processed\" flag.\n\n### How to set up\n1. **Google Tasks:** Create a new list named \"n8n Ideas\".\n2. **Google Sheets:** Create a new sheet with the following headers in the first row (A to H):\n   - `Date Added`\n   - `Idea Title`\n   - `Status`\n   - `Recommended Nodes`\n   - `Key Challenges`\n   - `Improvement Ideas`\n   - `Alternatives`\n   - `Source Task ID`\n3. **Credentials:** Configure credentials for **Google Tasks**, **Google Sheets**, **OpenAI**, and **Slack**.\n4. **Configure Nodes:**\n   - **[Step 1] Fetch New Ideas:** Select your Task list.\n   - **[Step 4] Slack — Review & Approve:** Select your target channel.\n   - **[Action] Archive to Sheets:** Select your Spreadsheet and Sheet.\n   - **[Close] Mark Task Done:** Select your Task list again.\n\n### Requirements\n- Google Tasks account\n- Google Sheets account\n- OpenAI API Key\n- Slack account",
