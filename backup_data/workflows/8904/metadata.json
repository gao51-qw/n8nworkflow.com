  "description": "## Overview ✨\n\nThis template **finds businesses on Google Maps → writes to Google Sheets → enriches + **verifies email contact** so your outreach stays clean and deliverable. It includes **Sticky Notes**  to explain the flow and setup.\n\n## What it does 🔎➡️📄➡️✅\n\n1. **Search & save**: Fetch places and append rows (Name, Address, Website, Rating, Phone) to your sheet.\n2. **Enrich**: Ask an LLM (Perplexity) for `Email` + a short company `Background`.\n3. **Verify emails**: For [Email Verification we use VerificarEmails](https://www.verificaremails.com/en/)  to validate every email address before writing back (fewer bounces, less blocking).\n\n&gt; ℹ️ **VerificarEmails node**: install the **community node** `@verificaremails/n8n-nodes-verificaremails` (Settings → Community Nodes) and use it **until it’s approved as a core node**. ✨\n[Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/EA6fWZtIXhk)\n\n## Requirements 🔐\n\n* Use n8n **Credentials** for: Google Sheets, Perplexity (Bearer), and VerificarEmails.\n* Keep prompts **short** and `temperature: 0` to lower cost.\n* Create a Google Sheet with the following headers: UUID, Name, Address, Website, Rating\tEmail, Valid, Email, Phone, Valid Phone, Summary\n\n## How to run ▶️\n\n1. Set your search params (query, locale, pages).\n2. Run the flow: it saves results → enriches → **verifies emails** → updates the sheet.\n3. If the read/update step doesn’t run, ensure the **finalization (Done) path** and the correct **sheet/tab** are selected.\n\n## Why verify? ✉️🧹\n\nBad emails cause **bounces, throttling, and blocks**. Verifying first protects sender reputation and improves deliverability.\nBeyond emails, [VerificarEmails](https://www.verificaremails.com/en/) also offers **phone, names. Check [Email Validation API](https://www.verificaremails.com/docs/en/) documentation to better understand verification results.\n",
