  "description": "## 📄 What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow turns TikTok videos into high-quality marketing insights and social-ready posts using Dumpling AI and GPT-4.\n\nIt takes a TikTok URL, keyword, and product name, then automatically extracts the video transcript, analyzes the content for key marketing insights (pain points, outcomes, triggers), and rewrites it as a social media post that positions your product as the solution. Everything is logged to Google Sheets for use by your content or product team.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n\n- Product marketers doing UGC research  \n- Copywriters repurposing TikTok into content  \n- Founders or VAs turning viral clips into assets  \n- Agencies building research-based social proof\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How to set up\n\n### ✅ Requirements\n- **Dumpling AI**: For TikTok transcript extraction  \n- **OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-4o-mini**: For analysis and rewriting  \n- **Google Sheets**: To log the results  \n- **n8n Form Trigger**: To input `TikTok URL`, `Keyword`, and `Product`\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Setup Instructions\n\n1. **Google Sheets**  \n   - Create a sheet with the following columns:  \n     - `Video URL`, `Original Transcription`, `Pain points`, `Desired outcomes`,  \n       `Triggers or motivating events`, `Interesting direct quotes`, `New Script`\n   - Update the sheet ID and tab in the Google Sheets node\n\n2. **Credentials**\n   - Add your Dumpling AI key using `HTTP Header Auth`\n   - Use GPT-4 via OpenAI credentials\n   - Connect your Google Sheets using OAuth2\n\n3. **Customization (Optional)**\n   - You can modify the GPT-4 prompts in the LangChain nodes to change tone, output structure, or content depth\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 How it works\n\n1. A form is submitted with a TikTok URL, keyword, and product\n2. Dumpling AI fetches and returns the TikTok transcript\n3. The VTT format is cleaned into plain text\n4. GPT-4 (via LangChain agent) extracts:\n   - Pain points\n   - Desired outcomes\n   - Motivating events\n   - Direct quotes\n5. GPT-4 then rewrites the transcript into a compelling marketing post\n6. Results are saved to Google Sheets for further use\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Customization ideas\n\n- Push insights to Notion or Airtable instead of Sheets  \n- Use Claude or Gemini instead of GPT-4  \n- Automatically generate image prompts to pair with the rewritten script  \n- Add notification email or Slack post when draft is ready  \n\n\n\n---\n\nThis workflow gives marketers and founders a fast way to convert real social content into reusable copy, backed by authentic user voice and GPT-powered insights.\n",
