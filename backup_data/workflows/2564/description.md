# YouTube to X Post

## Overview

This **n8n workflow** automates the process of promoting your latest YouTube videos on **X (formerly Twitter)**. It ensures that posts are engaging, concise, and follow platform-specific requirements. Additionally, the workflow logs social posts into a **Google Sheet** for record-keeping.

## Features

- **Character Limit Validation:** Ensures posts comply with X's character limit by rewriting if necessary.
- **Post Scheduling:** Automates post publishing to X.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Logs posts and their status for tracking and management.
- **Optional Notifications:** Sends updates via Discord, Slack, or Gmail (disabled by default).
