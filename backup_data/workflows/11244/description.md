## About This Template
This workflow turns complex data or topics sent via LINE into beautiful, easy-to-understand Infographics.

It combines **Gemini** (to analyze data and structure the visual layout) and **Nano Banana Pro** (accessed via Kie.ai API) to generate high-quality, data-rich graphics (Charts, timelines, processes).

## How It Works
1.  **Input:** User sends a topic or data points via LINE (e.g., "Japan's Energy Mix: 20% Solar, 10% Wind...").
2.  **Data Visualization Logic:** Gemini acts as an Information Designer, deciding the best chart type (Pie, Bar, Flow) and layout for the data.
3.  **Render:** Nano Banana generates a professional **3:4 Vertical Infographic**.
4.  **Smart Polling:** The workflow uses a loop to check the API status every 5 seconds, ensuring it waits exactly as long as needed.
5.  **Delivery:** Uploads to S3 and sends the visual report back to LINE.

## Who It’s For
* Social Media Managers needing quick visual content.
* Educators and presenters summarizing data.
* Consultants creating quick visual reports on the go.

## Requirements
* **n8n** (Cloud or Self-hosted).
* **Kie.ai API Key** (Nano Banana Pro).
* **Google Gemini API Key**.
* **AWS S3 Bucket** (Public access).
* **LINE Official Account**.

## Setup Steps
1.  **Credentials:** Configure Header Auth for Kie.ai and your other service credentials.
