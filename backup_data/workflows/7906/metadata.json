  "description": "This workflow allows to : \n- scrape Google Maps data using SerpAPI\n- discovery generic email addresses like contact@ using EmailListVerify API\n\n## Who’s it for\nThis template is designed to prepare cold outreach for local businesses like restaurants or hotels (you need to target a type of business that is listed on Google Maps).\n\nThis template will generate a list of leads with phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nThe email addresses you will get are generic, like contact@. This isn’t a problem if you are targeting small businesses, as the owner will most likely monitor those emails. However, if your ideal customer profile has more than 20 employees, I do not recommend using those email addresses for cold outreach.\n## Requirement\nThis template uses:\nGoogle Sheet to handle input and output data\n[SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) to scrape Google Maps (250 searches/month in the free plan)\n[EmailListVerify](https://emaillistverify.com/) to discover email (from $0.05 per email)\n\n## Notes\nThis template is an extension of [Lucas Perret template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2063-google-maps-scraper/) (adding email discovery module).\n\nIf there is some interest in it, I can make a similar template using [Apify](https://apify.com/compass/crawler-google-places?backlink=%252Fstore) as an alternative to SerpAPI for Google Map scraping.\n",
