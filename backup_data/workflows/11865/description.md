## Overview

* This workflow automates customer outreach for marketing campaigns, including customer prioritization, AI-generated emails, automated sending, reply tracking, and meeting scheduling.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Synchronization**

   * Customer and campaign data are periodically synchronized from Google Sheets and internal data tables.
   * New customers and campaigns are inserted into the system if they do not already exist.

2. **Customer Evaluation and Prioritization**

   * Customers are evaluated based on revenue, industry, capital, and location.
   * Each customer is classified into High / Medium / Low priority using AI.
   * Only high-priority customers are selected for campaign outreach.

3. **Campaign Detection**

   * The workflow checks for new, unsent marketing campaigns.
   * Campaigns marked as already sent are excluded.

4. **Personalized Email Generation**

   * For each eligible customer, past email history is retrieved.
   * An AI agent generates a personalized campaign email:

     * Uses historical interaction data when available.
     * Uses customer interests and keywords for new customers.
     * Produces a professional, friendly email proposing a meeting.

5. **Automated Email Sending**

   * Emails are sent automatically via Gmail.
   * Sent emails are logged into the message history database.
   * Campaign status is updated to “sent” after completion.

6. **Reply Handling**

   * Incoming customer replies are detected via Gmail triggers.
   * Replies are matched with previous messages and stored in the database.
   * AI generates an appropriate follow-up reply when required.

7. **Reply Classification and Scheduling**

   * Customer replies are classified as Positive / Pending / Negative.
   * If a reply includes scheduling information, meeting details are extracted.
   * Calendar events are automatically created in Google Calendar.
