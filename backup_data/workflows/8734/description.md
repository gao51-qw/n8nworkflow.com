## How it works
* Multi-modal AI Image Generator powered by Google's **Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)** - the latest state-of-the-art image generation model
* Accepts text, images, voice messages, and PDFs via Telegram for maximum flexibility
* Uses OpenAI GPT models for conversation and image analysis, then Nano Banana for stunning image generation
* Features conversation memory for iterative image modifications ("make it darker", "change to blue")
* Processes different input types: analyzes uploaded images, transcribes voice messages, extracts PDF text
* All inputs are converted to optimized prompts specifically tuned for Nano Banana's capabilities

## Set up steps
* Create Telegram bot via @BotFather and get API token
* Set up Google Gemini API key from Google AI Studio for **Nano Banana** image generation (~$0.04/image)
* Configure OpenAI API key for GPT models (conversation, image analysis, voice transcription)
* Import workflow and configure all three API credentials in n8n
* Update bot tokens in HTTP request nodes for file downloads
* Test with text prompts, image uploads, voice messages, and PDF documents
