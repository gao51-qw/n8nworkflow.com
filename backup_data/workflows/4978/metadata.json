  "description": "# Perplexity API Module\n\nThis reusable workflow allows you to interact with the [Perplexity API](https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/async-chat-completions-post) using the `sonar` or `sonar-pro` models. It is designed to be triggered from other workflows and accepts dynamic prompts via input parameters.\n\n## Features\n\n- 🧱 Modular: Triggered using `Execute Workflow` from any other workflow\n- 📥 Inputs:\n  - `SystemPrompt`: Set your system-level instruction for the LLM\n  - `UserPrompt`: The main user prompt for the conversation\n- 🧠 Uses Perplexity’s `chat/completions` endpoint\n- 🔐 Built with API authentication in mind (Bearer token or header auth)\n- 🔁 Easily extendable for any model in the Perplexity suite\n\n## Models supported\n- `sonar`\n- `sonar-pro`  \n[See full model list and capabilities](https://docs.perplexity.ai/models/model-cards)\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Set up your credentials in n8n under HTTP Bearer or Header Auth.\n2. Add this workflow as a subworkflow using the “Execute Workflow” node.\n3. Pass the desired `SystemPrompt` and `UserPrompt` as input variables.\n4. Receive the model response in return.\n\n## Notes\n\n- This template is inactive by default and safe to import.\n- Includes sticky notes with API references and model info.",
