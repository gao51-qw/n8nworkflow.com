**Reimbursements used to be a headache.**

Employees submitted receipts through emails, managers got stuck in approval chains, and finance teams spent hours checking for duplicates, updating sheets, and sending follow-up emails.

**So, we automated it.**

Using n8n, we built a smart Employee Reimbursement Workflow that does everything… in just a few clicks.

**Here’s how it works.**]
When an employee uploads a receipt, the workflow first checks for duplicates.
If the file is new, it’s uploaded to Google Drive instantly.
Next, a unique tracking ID is generated—no manual typing, no mistakes.
Then, all the details are logged in Google Sheets in real time, ready for records.
And finally, the Finance team gets an email notification with everything they need to process the payment—no chasing, no missing info.

**The impact?**
We’ve cut processing time by over 70%, reduced errors to nearly zero, and made the entire process stress-free for employees and finance alike.

This isn’t just automation—it’s giving people their time back.
