  "description": "### 🚨Are alert storms overwhelming your Security Operations workflows?\n\nThis n8n workflow supercharges your SOC by fully automating triage, analysis, and notification for Wazuh alerts—blending event-driven automation, OpenAI-powered contextual analysis, and real-time collaboration for incident response.\n\n### 🔑 Key Features:\n\n### ✅ Automated Triage:\nInstantly filters Wazuh alerts by severity to focus analyst effort on the signals that matter.\n\n### 🤖 AI-Driven Investigation Reports:\nUses OpenAI's **GPT-4o-mini** to auto-generate **context-rich incident reports**, including:\n- MITRE Tactic & Technique mapping  \n- Impacted scope (IP addresses, hostnames)  \n- External artifact reputation checks  \n- Actionable security recommendations  \n- Fully customizable prompt format aligned with your SOC playbooks\n\n### 📡 Multi-Channel Notification\nDelivers clean, actionable reports directly to your **SOC team via Telegram**. Easily extendable to Slack, Outlook, Gmail, Discord, or any other preferred channel.\n\n### 🔇 Noise Reduction\nEliminates alert fatigue using **smart filters** and **custom AI prompts** that suppress false positives and highlight real threats.\n\n### 🔧 Fully Customizable\nTweak severity thresholds, update prompt logic, or integrate additional data sources and channels — all with minimal effort\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n1. **Webhook**  \n   Listens for incoming Wazuh alerts in real time.\n\n2. **If Condition**  \n   Filters based on severity (`1 low`, `2 medium`, etc.) or other logic you define.\n\n3. **AI Investigation (LangChain + OpenAI)**  \n   Summarizes full alert logs and context using custom prompts to generate:\n   - Incident Overview  \n   - Key Indicators  \n   - Log Analysis  \n   - Threat Classification  \n   - Risk Assessment  \n   - Security Recommendations\n\n4. **Notification Delivery**  \n   The report is parsed, cleaned, and sent to your SOC team in real-time, enabling rapid response — even during high-alert volumes.\n\n5. **No-Op Path**  \n   Efficiently discards irrelevant alerts without breaking the flow.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Why n8n + AI?\n\nTraditional alert triage is **manual**, **slow**, and **error-prone** — leading to analyst burnout and missed critical threats.\n\nThis workflow shows how combining **workflow automation** with a **tailored AI model** enables your SOC to shift from **reactive** to **proactive**. Analysts can now:\n- Focus on **critical investigations**\n- Respond to alerts **faster**\n- Eliminate **copy-paste fatigue**\n- Get instant **contextual summaries**\n\n&gt; ⚠️ **Note:** We learned that generic AI isn’t enough. Context-rich prompts and alignment with your actual SOC processes are key to meaningful, scalable automation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Ready to build a smarter, less stressful SOC?\n\nClone this workflow, adapt it to your processes, and never miss a critical alert again.\n\n📬 Contributions welcome!  \nFeel free to raise PRs, suggest new enhancements, or fork for your own use cases.\n\n---\n\n**Created by [Mariskarthick M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariskarthickm/)**  \nSenior Security Analyst | Detection Engineer | Threat Hunter | Open-Source Enthusiast",
