This updated workflow will automatically archive your Spotify `Discover Weekly` tracks to another **manually created** playlist, without the nuisance of duplicate tracks. It utilizes the latest verisons of n8n's [`Schedule trigger`](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), [`Spotify`](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.spotify/), [`Switch`](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/), [`Merge`](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), and [`IF`](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) nodes.

Special thanks to [trey](https://community.n8n.io/u/trey) for their original version of the workflow, as well as [ihortom](https://community.n8n.io/u/ihortom) for their [help with navigating the `Switch` node's outputs](https://community.n8n.io/t/targeting-previous-switch-node-outputs/34919).

#### To use this workflow, you'll need to:
- Create a playlist for use as the archive playlist within your Spotify account
- Create and select your Spotify credentials within each Spotify node within the workflow

See workflow `README` for additional information and optional setup steps.
