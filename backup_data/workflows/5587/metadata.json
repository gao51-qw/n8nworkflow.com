  "description": "This sub-workflow uses two custom Hugging Face regression models from Open Paws to evaluate and predict the real-world performance and advocacy alignment of text content. It’s designed to support animal advocacy organizations in optimizing their messaging across platforms like social media, email campaigns, and more.\n\n### 🛠️ What It Does\n\n* Sends input text to two deployed Hugging Face endpoints:\n\n  * **Predicted Performance Model** – Estimates real-world content success (e.g., engagement, shares, opens) based on patterns from real online data.\n  * **Advocate Preference Model** – Predicts how well the content will resonate with animal advocates (emotional impact, relevance, rationality, etc.)\n* Outputs structured scores for both models\n* Can be integrated into larger workflows for automated content review, filtering, or revision\n\n### 📊 About the Models\n\n* **Text Performance Prediction Model**\n  Trained on real-world data from **30+ animal advocacy organizations**, this model predicts actual online performance of content—including social media, email marketing, and other outreach channels.\n\n* **Advocate Preference Prediction Model**\n  Trained on ratings from animal advocates to evaluate how well a piece of text aligns with advocacy goals and values.\n\nModel Repositories:\n\n* [`open-paws/text_performance_prediction_longform`](https://huggingface.co/open-paws/text_performance_prediction_longform)\n* [`open-paws/animal_advocate_preference_prediction_longform`](https://huggingface.co/open-paws/animal_advocate_preference_prediction_longform)\n\n&gt; 📌 You must deploy each model as an **inference endpoint** on Hugging Face. Click **\"Deploy\"** on each model’s repo, then add the **endpoint URL** and your **Hugging Face access token** using n8n credentials.\n\n---\n\n### 📦 Use Cases\n\n* Advocacy content review before publishing\n* Automated scoring of outreach messages\n* Filtering or flagging content with low predicted impact\n* A/B testing support for message optimization",
