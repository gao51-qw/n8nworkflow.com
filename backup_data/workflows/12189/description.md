## 🎓 How It Works

### Step 1: Data Input & Filtering
Reads all leads from Google Sheets and filters out already-processed leads (those with a value in "Research Status" column).

### Step 2: Company Data Enrichment
- Updates status to "Pending" in Google Sheets
- Searches Sona database using domain or email
- 5-tier smart matching algorithm finds best company match
- Retrieves firmographic data and technology stack

### Step 3: AI Company Research
GPT-4.1-mini analyzes company data to generate:
- Specific pain points based on industry, size, tech stack
- Growth opportunities and market positioning
- Personalization hooks from company description
- Recommended outreach tone and CTA
- One-liner insight for email opening

### Step 4: Personalized Email Generation
AI crafts cold email following best practices:
- Curiosity-driven subject line (max 8 words)
- Opens with personalization hook showing research
- References ONE specific pain point
- Focuses on tangible outcomes (not product features)
- Natural CTA without being pushy
- Professional but conversational tone

### Step 5: Data Output & Loop
- Formats all data for Google Sheets
- Creates Gmail compose link with pre-filled content
- Updates sheet with complete results
- Sets status to "Completed"
- Waits 2 seconds, then processes next lead

## ⚡ Pro Tips

- **Start small:** Test with 5-10 leads to validate personalization quality
- **Review first emails:** Adjust AI prompts if tone needs calibration
- **Clean your data:** Better input domains = better Sona matches
- **Monitor fit scores:** Focus manual review on High/Medium fits
