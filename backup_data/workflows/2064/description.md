## Features

- **URL Metadata Extraction:** Parses URLs to extract metadata such as titles, descriptions, images, and favicons.
- **OpenGraph API Integration:** Utilizes OpenGraph API for detailed metadata retrieval.
- **Switchy API Integration:** Manages shortened links via the Switchy API.
- **GitHub API Integration:** Uses GitHub for hosting images related to the URLs.
- **Screenshot Capabilities:** Captures screenshots of web pages as part of metadata.
- **API Authorization and Configuration:** Manages API keys and configurations for external service integration.

## Workflow Structure

1. **Split In Batches:** Processes URLs in batches.
2. **API Auth:** Configures API authorization.
3. **URL Processing Nodes:** Extract metadata using various nodes like Get Headers, OpenGraph API, and Meta tags Scraper.
4. **Conditional Nodes:** Include IF OpenGraph Invalid and If - Enable ScreenShots for logic handling.
5. **Data Aggregation:** Uses nodes like Method 1 - META for final metadata aggregation.
6. **Switchy API:** Handles link creation and updating.
7. **GitHub Integration:** Hosts screenshots and images on a personal GitHub repository.
8. **Final Output:** Provides the shortened URL after processing.

## GitHub Repository Setup

To use this workflow, ensure your GitHub API is linked for hosting images. Set up a repository where the workflow can upload screenshots and other related images. This repository will be referenced in the workflow nodes where images are handled.

## Configuration

Before running the workflow, set up the necessary API keys and configurations in the **API Auth** node. Adjust batch size and other parameters as needed.

## Error Handling

The workflow includes nodes like **Stop and Error** for robust error handling, post an issue and mention the creator using [N8N community](https://community.n8n.io).

## Contributions

This workflow is open for community contributions. Enhancements and improvements are welcome.
