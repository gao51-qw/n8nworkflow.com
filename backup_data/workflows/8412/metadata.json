  "description": "## Website & API Health Monitoring System with HTTP Status Validation\n\n## How it works\n- Performs HTTP health checks on websites and APIs with automatic health status validation\n- Checks HTTP status codes and analyzes JSON responses for common health indicators\n- Returns detailed status information including response times and health status\n- Implements conditional logic to handle different response scenarios\n- Perfect for monitoring dashboards, alerts, and automated health checks\n\n## Set up steps\n- Deploy the workflow and activate it\n- Get the webhook URL from the trigger node\n- Configure your monitoring system to call the webhook endpoint\n- Send POST requests with target URLs for health monitoring\n- Receive JSON responses with health status, HTTP codes, and timestamps\n\n## Usage\n- Send POST requests to the webhook URL with target URL parameter\n- Optionally configure timeout and status expectations in request body\n- Receive JSON responses with health status, HTTP codes, and timestamps  \n- Perfect for monitoring dashboards, alerts, and automated health checks\n- Use with external monitoring tools like Nagios, Zabbix, or custom dashboards\n- Set up scheduled monitoring calls for continuous health validation\n- Example request: Send POST with `{\"url\": \"https://your-site.com\", \"timeoutMs\": 5000}`\n- Success response returns: `{\"ok\": true, \"statusCode\": 200, \"healthStatus\": \"ok\"}`\n- Failure response returns: `{\"ok\": false, \"error\": \"Health check failed\", \"statusCode\": 503}`\n\n## Benefits\n- Proactive monitoring to identify issues before they impact users\n- Detailed diagnostics with comprehensive health data for troubleshooting\n- Integration ready - works with existing monitoring and alerting systems\n- Customizable timeout settings, expected status codes, and health indicators\n- Scalable solution to monitor multiple services with single workflow endpoint\n\n## Use Cases\n- E-commerce platforms: Monitor payment APIs, inventory systems, user authentication\n- Microservices: Health validation for distributed service architectures\n- API gateways: Endpoint monitoring with response time validation\n- Database connections: Track connectivity and performance metrics\n- Third-party integrations: Monitor external API dependencies and SLA compliance\n\n## Target Audience\n- DevOps Engineers implementing production monitoring\n- System Administrators managing server uptime\n- Site Reliability Engineers building monitoring systems\n- Development Teams tracking API health in staging/production\n- IT Support Teams for proactive issue detection",
