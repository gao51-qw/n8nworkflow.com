Can be enabled to acknowledge receipt.\n\n### **How to set up**\n\n1. **Gmail Integration**\n   - Connect Gmail in the “Gmail Trigger” and “Get Email Content” nodes.\n2. **OpenAI Configuration**\n   - Use OpenAI API credentials in both the Reader and Advisor agent models.\n3. **Jira Integration**\n   - Authenticate your Jira account.\n   - Set project key and issue fields in the “Create Main Issue” node.\n4. **Slack Notification**\n   - Configure Slack connection and select a target channel.\n5. **Set up Jira, Slack, Email**\n   - Set your company Jira based URL, IT Support slack channel and IT Support email in the Edit Fields (Set) node \n6. **(Optional)** Email Acknowledgment\n   - Provide SendGrid credentials and email template in the “Send email to requester” node if re-enabled.\n\n### **Requirements**\n\n- Gmail API access with appropriate permissions  \n- OpenAI account with API access (for GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)  \n- Jira instance with project and permission to create/comment on issues  \n- Slack workspace and Webhook or OAuth setup  \n- n8n instance running with all above integrations configured\n\n### **How to customize the workflow**\n\n- **Enhance Email Deduplication**: Adjust the deduplication logic to use `message-id`, `threadId`, or custom headers.\n- **Expand Reader Agent**: Configure the LLM to extract more details such as asset tags, urgency levels, or locations.\n- **Tailor Advisor Agent**: Adjust prompt to generate multiple solutions, troubleshooting guides, or internal references.\n- **Routing by Department**: Add logic to forward requests to different teams based on the request category or department.\n- **Enable Email Acknowledgment**: Activate and customize the email notification step to inform requesters that their issue is being handled.",
