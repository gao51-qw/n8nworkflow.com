  "description": "System Prompt Generator Using Unli.dev turns human input ideas into a polished, repeatable system prompt blueprint.\n\nIt uses an n8n webhook, a small Set/Prepare pipeline, and Unli.dev's chat completions to generate single-turn, comprehensive system prompts that include:\n- persona\n- mission\n- rules\n- output format\n- designer notes\n\nso your team spends less time arguing about wording and more time shipping features (and you get consistent LLM behavior across apps).\n\n## 💡 Why Use System Prompt Generator Using Unli.dev?\n\n- **Fix the pain of inconsistency** \n- **Improve outcomes measurably** \n- **Competitive advantage:** Standardize your AI behavior with enforceable rules and templates so your product's voice and constraints stay consistent across teams — like an AI style guide that never takes a coffee break.\n\n## ⚡ Perfect For\n\n- **Prompt Engineers:** Systematize prompt design and handoffs.\n- **Product Managers:** Lock down expected AI behaviors before launch.\n- **Developers & AI Ops:** Automate prompt generation for testing and deployments.\n\n## 🔧 How It Works\n\n1. **⏱ Trigger:** Incoming HTTP POST to the webhook path `systempromptgenerator` kicks everything off.\n2. **📎 Process:** Webhook → Set Prompt/Model (map incoming fields) → Prepare API Body (compose messages) → Unli.Dev (Chat Completions) → Extract Answer → Respond to Webhook.\n3. **🤖 Smart Logic:** Unli.dev (chat completions) runs a single-turn generation using the embedded system-template that builds persona, operational protocol, rules, output format, and designer notes automatically.\n4. **💌 Output:** The generated system prompt (with Designer's Notes) is returned in the webhook response for immediate use in your app or CI pipeline.\n\n ⚠️ **Security Note:** You'll want to swap in your Unli.dev API key under the HTTP header auth credential—don't share it in Slack. Seriously.\n\n## 🧩 Requirements\n\n- Active n8n instances\n- Unli.dev API key / account\n- HTTP Header Auth credential configured in n8n\n- Optional: Postman or curl for testing\n\n## 🛠️ Level Up Ideas\n\n- **Add a lightweight front-end form** to let non-technical PMs generate prompts and preview outputs\n- **Add validation rules** or automated tests that run generated system prompts against sample user queries to catch unwanted behavior early\n\nMade by: **[Khaisa Studio](https://khaisa.studio?utm_source=n8nofficial)**  \nCategory: `system-prompt`, `unli.dev`\n\nNeed custom work? **[Contact me!](https://khmuhtadin.com/contact)**",
