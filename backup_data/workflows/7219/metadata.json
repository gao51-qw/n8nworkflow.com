Here is a detailed, node-by-node explanation of how it works and how to set it up in n8n.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n\nThis workflow acts as a bridge between your website's contact form and your sales team. It waits for a submission from your website via a **Webhook**. As soon as a new lead fills out the form, the workflow instantly captures their data and sends a formatted notification to your team's Slack channel. This ensures your team can respond to new leads in real time, without any delays.\n\n---\n\n### **Setup Steps**\n\n#### **1. Webhooks Trigger: Receive Website Form Submissions**\n* **Node Type:** `Webhook Trigger`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **HTTP Method:** `POST`\n    * **Path:** `new-lead`\n* **Explanation:** This node is the starting point. It creates a unique URL that you will use in your website's form submission settings. When a visitor submits your form, the data is sent to this URL as a `POST` request, triggering the workflow.\n\n#### **2. Slack: Notify Sales Team**\n* **Node Type:** `Slack`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_SLACK_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Post Message`\n    * **Channel:** `YOUR_SALES_CHANNEL_ID` (e.g., `#sales-leads`)\n    * **Text:** `*New Website Lead!* - Name: {{ $json.name }}\n        - Company: {{ $json.company }}\n        - Email: {{ $json.email }}\n        - Message: {{ $json.message }}`\n* **Explanation:** This node sends a formatted message to your designated Slack channel. The curly braces `{{ }}` contain n8n expressions that dynamically pull the data (name, company, email, etc.) from the website form submission.\n\n#### **3. Google Sheets: Archive Lead Data (Optional)**\n* **Node Type:** `Google Sheets`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Add Row`\n    * **Spreadsheet ID:** `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID`\n    * **Sheet Name:** `Leads`\n    * **Data:**\n        * `Name`: `={{ $json.name }}`\n        * `Email`: `={{ $json.email }}`\n        * `Date`: `={{ $now }}`\n* **Explanation:** This is an optional but recommended step. This node automatically adds a new row to a Google Sheet, creating a clean, organized archive of all your website leads.\n\n#### **4. Gmail: Send Automatic Confirmation Email (Optional)**\n* **Node Type:** `Gmail`\n* **Credentials:** `YOUR_GMAIL_CREDENTIAL`\n* **Parameters:**\n    * **Operation:** `Send`\n    * **To:** `={{ $json.email }}`\n    * **Subject:** `Thanks for contacting us!`\n    * **Body:** `Hi {{ $json.name }}, thanks for reaching out. We've received your message and will get back to you shortly.`\n* **Explanation:** This node provides a quick and professional automated response to the new lead, confirming that their message has been received.\n\n### **Final Step: Activation**\n\n1.  After configuring the nodes, click **\"Save\"** at the top of the canvas.\n2.  Click the **\"Active\"** toggle in the top-right corner. The workflow is now live and will listen for new form submissions.\n3.  **Remember:** You need to configure your website's form to send a `POST` request to the URL from your `Webhook Trigger` node.",
