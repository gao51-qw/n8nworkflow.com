## How it works: ##
This workflow automates the entire LinkedIn content distribution process — from AI-powered post creation to auto-posting on both personal LinkedIn profiles and LinkedIn groups, using GPT-4o and Google Sheets as the content source and control panel.

1. Auto-generates professional LinkedIn posts from spreadsheet topics using GPT-4o.
2. Posts to your LinkedIn profile and multiple groups.
3. Updates status to avoid duplicate posting.
4. Fully customizable and reusable with your spreadsheet.

	1. Name it: Linkedin Post
	2. Sheet1 (for post topics): Columns: ID | Linkedin Post Title | Status
	3. Add post titles under Linkedin Post Title
	4. Set Status to Pending
	5. Create new sheet name as "Groups" (for group distribution): Column: GroupIds
	6. Add LinkedIn Group IDs, one per row

2. Connect Google Sheets Nodes
	1. Connect your Google account to these nodes:
		1. Linkedin Post topic (Reads post topics)
		2. Get group id (Reads LinkedIn groups)
		3. Update Status (Writes back the status after posting)

3. Configure GPT-4o (OpenAI)
	1. Add your OpenAI API key in the Linkedin Post creator node
	2. This node will generate high-quality content from your topic titles

4. Connect LinkedIn Account
