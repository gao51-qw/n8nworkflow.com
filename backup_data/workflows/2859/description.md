## Who is this template for?

This workflow template is designed for any professionals seeking relevent data from database using natural language.

## How it works

- Each time user ask's question using the n8n chat interface, the workflow runs.
- Then the message is processed by AI Agent using relevent tools - `Execute SQL Query`, `Get DB Schema and Tables List` and `Get Table Definition`, if required. Agent uses these tool to form and run sql query which are necessary to answer the questions.
- Once AI Agent has the data, it uses it to form answer and returns it to the user.

## Set up instructions

Complete the Set up credentials step when you first open the workflow. You'll need a Postgresql Credentials, and OpenAI api key.
