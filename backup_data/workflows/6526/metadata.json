  "description": "## Fetch and Extract all Website Pages Content and Store in Pinecone Vector Database as KnowledgeBase with Google Gemini Embeddings\n \nUse cases are many: Populate a custom chatbot's knowledge base, create a powerful search index for your website, or build a comprehensive repository of information for internal tools!\n\n**Good to know**\n\n* At time of writing, Pinecone and Gemini API costs apply based on usage. Refer to their respective pricing pages for updated information.\n* The models used in this workflow are subject to regional availability. If you encounter a \"model not found\" error, the service may not be available in your country or region.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1.  **Input Collection:** The workflow starts by collecting URLs, either from a user-provided sitemap or a list of individual page URLs.\n2.  **URL Processing:** It then fetches sitemap XML (if provided), converts it to JSON, extracts all page URLs, and merges them with any manually entered URLs. All duplicate URLs are removed to ensure efficiency.\n3.  **Content Fetching:** The workflow iterates through the unique URLs, sending HTTP requests to download the HTML content of each page. A small delay is added between requests to be courteous to the website servers.\n4.  **Content Extraction:** The HTML content is then processed to extract the main textual content from the page's body, excluding images, and cleaning the text for better quality.\n5.  **Embedding Generation:** Gemini's embedding model converts the extracted text into vector embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of the content.\n6.  **Pinecone Storage:** Finally, these vector embeddings, along with their associated content, are uploaded to your specified Pinecone index, creating a searchable knowledge base. Existing data in the namespace is cleared before new data is inserted.\n\n**How to use**\n\n* The workflow is triggered by a form where you input your sitemap or page URLs.\n* You can monitor the execution flow within n8n to see pages being processed and uploaded.\n* The `Wait 5 sec` node can be adjusted if you need to fetch content more rapidly or slowly, depending on the website's rate limits.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n* **Google Gemini API key** for text embeddings.\n* **Pinecone API key** for vector database storage.\n\n**Customising this workflow**\n\nThis workflow can be adapted for various purposes. Consider:\n\n* Adding more sophisticated HTML parsing logic to extract specific sections of a webpage.\n* For building a Web Support Chatbot\n* Integrating with other services to trigger updates to the knowledge base (e.g., automatically updating when new blog posts are published).\n* Connecting the Pinecone knowledge base to a chatbot or search application for enhanced functionalities.",
