This template aims to perform Q&A on data retrieved from another n8n workflow. Since that workflow can be used to retrieve any data from any service, this template can be used to ask questions about any data.

It uses a manual trigger, various AI nodes, and an OpenAI Chat Model to extract and provide relevant information based on a specific query.

Note that to use this template, you need to be on n8n version 1.19.4 or later.
