🎥 Auto-Caption Videos for Instagram with Google Drive + Submagic

Description
Save hours on video editing with this workflow! Whenever you upload a video to a specific Google Drive folder, it’s automatically sent to Submagic to generate engaging captions (using your chosen template). Once the captioned video is ready, it’s pulled back, downloaded, and uploaded into your Google Drive—fully captioned and Instagram-ready.
