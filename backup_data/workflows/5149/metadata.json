  "description": "## How it works\n\nThis workflow converts an HTML string into a polished PDF file using the powerful open-source [Gotenberg](https://gotenberg.dev/) service. It's designed to be a reusable utility in your automation stack.\n\n1.  **Receives Input:** The workflow is triggered with a JSON object containing the full `html` code as a string and a desired `file_name` for the output.\n2.  **Prepares File:** It converts the incoming HTML string into a binary `index.html` file, which is required for the API call.\n3.  **Calls Gotenberg API:** It sends the HTML file to a running Gotenberg instance via an HTTP request. It also dynamically sets the output filename and embeds metadata (like Author, Title, and Creation Date) directly into the PDF.\n4.  **Returns PDF:** The workflow outputs the final binary PDF file, ready to be saved, sent in an email, or used in the next step of your main workflow.\n\n## Set up steps\n\n**Setup time: ~3 minutes**\n\nThis workflow has one critical prerequisite: a running Gotenberg instance that your n8n can connect to.\n\n**1. Prerequisite: Run Gotenberg**\n\nYou need to have the Gotenberg service running. The easiest way is with Docker. Add the following service to your `docker-compose.yml` file (the same one you use for n8n):\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  # ... your n8n service ...\n\n  gotenberg:\n    image: gotenberg/gotenberg:8\n    restart: always\n```\n\nThen, restart your stack with `docker compose up -d`. This makes Gotenberg available at the address `http://gotenberg:3000` from within your n8n container.\n\n**2. Use as a Sub-Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is ready to be used as a sub-workflow.\n\n1.  In your main workflow, add an **Execute Sub-Workflow** node.\n2.  In the **Workflow** parameter, select this \"Create PDF from HTML\" workflow.\n3.  Provide the input data in the required format: a JSON object with `html` and `file_name` keys.",
