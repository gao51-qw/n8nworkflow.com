    "description": "# 🎧 Convert Unread Newsletters into Conversational AI Podcasts\n\n**Turn email overload into audio insights — automatically.**\n\nThis workflow transforms unread newsletters sitting in your inbox into engaging, human-like audio conversations between two AI voices. It’s perfect for listening during your commute, workout, or while multitasking.\n\nInspired by Google's NotebookLM, this automation brings long-form content to life by summarizing dense text into a natural dialogue using OpenAI and generating high-quality voice narration with ElevenLabs. The result? A dynamic audio file sent right back to your inbox — hands-free, screen-free, and stress-free.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 What this workflow does\n\n- ✅ Connects to your Gmail inbox to fetch unread newsletters\n- 🤖 Uses GPT-4o Mini to summarize and rephrase content as a conversation\n- 🗣️ Sends the dialogue to ElevenLabs to generate voice clips (`voice1` + `voice2`)\n- 🔁 Merges all audio segments into a single podcast-like MP3 using FFmpeg\n- 📬 Emails the final audio back to you for easy listening\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ What you'll need\n\n- A Gmail account with IMAP enabled\n- An OpenAI API key (GPT-4o Mini recommended for cost/performance)\n- An ElevenLabs API key + selected voice IDs\n- A **self-hosted or local n8n instance with FFmpeg installed**\n- Basic knowledge of binary data and audio handling in n8n\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Use cases\n\n- Convert long newsletters into hands-free listening experiences\n- Repurpose Substack or Beehiiv content for podcast-like distribution\n- Build an internal voice dashboard for teams who prefer audio updates\n\n---\n\n## 🙌 Want to go further?\n\nThis workflow is modular and extensible. You can add steps to:\n\n- Upload the final audio to Spotify, SoundCloud, or Telegram\n- Publish to a private podcast RSS feed\n- Create a daily audio digest from multiple newsletters\n\n---\n\n### 📬 Contact & Feedback\n\nNeed help customizing it? Have ideas or feedback?\n\nFeel free to reach out:  \n📩 **Luis.acosta@news2podcast.com**\n\nIf you're building something more advanced with audio + AI, like automated podcast publishing to Spotify — let me know and I’ll figure out how I can help you!\n",

The conversation should be fluid, informal, and engaging — similar in tone and structure to how NotebookLM rewrites long documents as discussions. It must sound like two well-informed people exchanging ideas, not like a text being read aloud.\n\n### Roles\n\n- **voice1**: Curious, expressive, casual, often injects humor or everyday references. Tends to ask questions, react with surprise or amusement, and bring lightness to the discussion.\n- **voice2**: Analytical, composed, insightful. Adds perspective, context, and a slightly ironic or dry sense of humor. Offers clarity without sounding robotic.\n\nUse realistic, human-like phrasing with brief interjections (`\"Right?\"`, `\"Let me stop you there\"`, `\"That's exactly it\"`). Use `<break time=\"1.5s\" />` tags occasionally to simulate natural pauses.\n\n### Structure\n\n1. **Introduction**: Set the scene naturally. Briefly introduce what the episode is about based on the content, without listing or labeling sections. Present `voice1` and `voice2` through dialogue, not narration.\n2. **Content Breakdown**: For each key idea or section from the newsletter:\n   - Paraphrase the content in spoken language.\n   - Embed the headline or theme organically in the conversation.\n   - Include personal reactions, examples, and small tangents to make it relatable.\n   - Open loops by teasing questions or ideas that will be answered later in the conversation.\n   - Maintain curiosity and variety in tone and rhythm.\n3. **Closing**: End warmly and casually, with a brief comment on what stood out or what’s coming next (no need for formal farewells).\n\n### Requirements\n\n- The script must be at least **ten thousand characters** (about 15 minutes of speech).\n- Use **commas** to separate items in a list, not periods.\n- Format the output as a single uninterrupted block of text with clear speaker tags:\n  \nvoice1: …\nvoice2: …\n\nYou will be given a newsletter input under this key:\n\n{{$('Get Newsletter').first().json.text}}\n\nGenerate only the final dialogue script — no explanations, bullet points, or headings. Just the conversation in English.\n\n\n"

After logging in, go to Voices, find the voice that best fits your needs, and copy the Voice ID by clicking on the three dots [...]\n\n   - Sample JSON body:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"text\": \"Your cleaned and formatted dialogue text here.\",\n       \"model_id\": \"eleven_multilingual_v2\",\n       \"voice_settings\": {\n         \"stability\": 0.4,\n         \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - You can have one node for each speaker (`voice1`, `voice2`) with a different **voice ID** in the URL.\n\n---\n\n### 🔁 Output\n- Each iteration sends one segment to ElevenLabs.\n- The result will be a **binary audio file** (MP3) for each speaker’s line.\n- You can later merge them using FFmpeg or the Audio Merge node.\n\n---\n\n> This section is key to giving your newsletter content an actual voice — literally! And with ElevenLabs' high-quality synthesis and GPT-4o Mini's conversational structure, the result is natural, polished audio narration.\n"

Loops through all items, assuming each item has:\n   - `fileName`\n   - `directory` (only for the first file)\n2. Builds a properly formatted FFmpeg list:\n   ```\n   file 'audio_1.mp3'\n   file 'audio_2.mp3'\n   file 'audio_3.mp3'\n   ```\n3. Converts the result to **Base64-encoded binary data** so it can be saved using the `Write Binary File` node.\n\n📝 The result is written to:\n\n```\n/newsletter2podcast/tmp/concat_list.txt\n```\n\nCode logic highlights:\n- First item uses full path: `${directory}/${fileName}`\n- Others use just `fileName`\n- Converts the list to a `Buffer` and then to base64 for n8n binary handling\n\n---\n\n### 🎬 Step 8 – Merge Audio with FFmpeg\n\nAn `Execute Command` node runs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i /newsletter2podcast/tmp/concat_list.txt -c copy /newsletter2podcast/tmp/final_merged.mp3\n```\n\nThis generates the final, merged audio file using **lossless concatenation**:\n\n- `-y`: Overwrites existing output\n- `-f concat`: Uses FFmpeg’s concat demuxer\n- `-safe 0`: Allows absolute paths\n- `-c copy`: Copies streams without re-encoding\n\n🆕 Output location:\n\n```\n/newsletter2podcast/tmp/final_merged.mp3\n```\n\nDelete the audio chunks and the concat_list\n\n```bash\nfind /newsletter2podcast/tmp/ -type f ! -name \"final_merged.mp3\" -delete\n```\n---\n\n### 📌 Notes\n\n- Ensure all audio files are encoded consistently (same format, codec, bitrate)\n- If ElevenLabs was used, they’re already compatible\n- If sync issues occur, you can preprocess files with re-encoding (`-c:a libmp3lame`)\n- This process assumes FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your n8n environment\n\n---\n\n> ✅ This step finalizes your audio transformation — from dialogue chunks to a smooth, podcast-ready episode.\n"
