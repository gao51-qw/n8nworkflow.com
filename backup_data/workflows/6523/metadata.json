  "description": "# 🎧 Convert Unread Newsletters into Conversational AI Podcasts\n\n**Turn email overload into audio insights — automatically.**\n\nThis workflow transforms unread newsletters sitting in your inbox into engaging, human-like audio conversations between two AI voices. It’s perfect for listening during your commute, workout, or while multitasking.\n\nInspired by Google's NotebookLM, this automation brings long-form content to life by summarizing dense text into a natural dialogue using OpenAI and generating high-quality voice narration with ElevenLabs. The result? A dynamic audio file sent right back to your inbox — hands-free, screen-free, and stress-free.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 What this workflow does\n\n- ✅ Connects to your Gmail inbox to fetch unread newsletters\n- 🤖 Uses GPT-4o Mini to summarize and rephrase content as a conversation\n- 🗣️ Sends the dialogue to ElevenLabs to generate voice clips (`voice1` + `voice2`)\n- 🔁 Merges all audio segments into a single podcast-like MP3 using FFmpeg\n- 📬 Emails the final audio back to you for easy listening\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ What you'll need\n\n- A Gmail account with IMAP enabled\n- An OpenAI API key (GPT-4o Mini recommended for cost/performance)\n- An ElevenLabs API key + selected voice IDs\n- A **self-hosted or local n8n instance with FFmpeg installed**\n- Basic knowledge of binary data and audio handling in n8n\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Use cases\n\n- Convert long newsletters into hands-free listening experiences\n- Repurpose Substack or Beehiiv content for podcast-like distribution\n- Build an internal voice dashboard for teams who prefer audio updates\n\n---\n\n## 🙌 Want to go further?\n\nThis workflow is modular and extensible. You can add steps to:\n\n- Upload the final audio to Spotify, SoundCloud, or Telegram\n- Publish to a private podcast RSS feed\n- Create a daily audio digest from multiple newsletters\n\n---\n\n### 📬 Contact & Feedback\n\nNeed help customizing it?
