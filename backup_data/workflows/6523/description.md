# 🎧 Convert Unread Newsletters into Conversational AI Podcasts

**Turn email overload into audio insights — automatically.**

This workflow transforms unread newsletters sitting in your inbox into engaging, human-like audio conversations between two AI voices. It’s perfect for listening during your commute, workout, or while multitasking.

Inspired by Google's NotebookLM, this automation brings long-form content to life by summarizing dense text into a natural dialogue using OpenAI and generating high-quality voice narration with ElevenLabs. The result? A dynamic audio file sent right back to your inbox — hands-free, screen-free, and stress-free.

- 🤖 Uses GPT-4o Mini to summarize and rephrase content as a conversation
- 🗣️ Sends the dialogue to ElevenLabs to generate voice clips (`voice1` + `voice2`)
- 🔁 Merges all audio segments into a single podcast-like MP3 using FFmpeg
- 📬 Emails the final audio back to you for easy listening
