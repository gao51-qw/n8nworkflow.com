    "description": "# ⚙ **How It Works & Setup Steps: Automated Birthday Discount**\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\n\nThis workflow is a powerful yet simple automation to delight your customers on their birthdays. It runs every day on a schedule you define and automatically pulls data from your customer list on Google Sheets. The workflow then checks to see if any customer has a birthday on the current day. If a match is found, it generates a unique discount code and sends a personalized, celebratory email with the code directly to the customer. This ensures no birthday is ever missed, fostering customer loyalty and driving sales with zero manual effort.\n\n---\n\n## **Setup Steps**\n\nFollow these steps to get the workflow running in your n8n instance and start sending automated birthday discounts.\n\n## **1. Prerequisites**\nYou will need a working n8n instance and a few key accounts:\n* **Google Sheets:** To store your customer data, including their email address and birthday. The birthday column should be formatted as **`MM-dd`** (e.g., `08-27`).\n* **Gmail:** To send the personalized birthday emails to your customers.\n\n## **2. Workflow Import**\nImport the provided workflow JSON into your n8n canvas. All the necessary nodes will appear on your canvas, ready for configuration.\n\n## **3. Configure Credentials**\nConnect the following credentials to their respective nodes:\n* **Google Sheets:** Connect your Google account to the **`Get Customer Data`** node.\n* **Gmail:** Connect your Gmail account to the **`Send Birthday Email`** node.\n\n## **4. Customize the Workflow**\n1.  **`Get Customer Data`:**\n    * Enter the **`Spreadsheet ID`** and **`Sheet Name`** of your Google Sheet containing the customer data.\n2.  **`Is It Their Birthday?`:**\n    * This node compares the customer's birthday column with the current date. Ensure `{{ $json.birthday }}` matches the exact name of your birthday column in Google Sheets.\n3.  **`Generate Discount Code`:**\n    * This node is pre-configured to create a simple unique code. For an e-commerce platform (like Shopify or WooCommerce), you will need to replace this node with the specific API call to generate a valid coupon code in your system.\n4.  **`Send Birthday Email`:**\n    * Enter your sender email in the **`From Email`** field.\n    * Customize the **`Subject`** and **`Message`** with your own text and branding to make it personal. The `{{ $json.name }}` and `{{ $json.discountCode }}` expressions will automatically pull the correct customer name and generated code.\n\n## **5. Activate the Workflow**\nOnce all configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** and then **\"Active\"**. The workflow is now live and will automatically run every morning to send out birthday wishes!",

            "content": "# ⚙ Workflow Note: Automated Birthday Discount for E-Commerce\n\n---\n\n## **Problem**\nMany e-commerce businesses miss the opportunity to create a personal connection with their customers. Sending a special birthday offer is a powerful way to build loyalty and increase sales, but doing this manually for every customer is time-consuming and prone to human error. Without an automated system, these valuable marketing moments are often overlooked.\n\n## **Solution**\nThis simple but effective n8n workflow solves this problem by automating the entire birthday outreach process. The system runs daily, checks your customer database for birthdays, generates a unique discount code, and sends a personalized email to the customer on their special day. This ensures a timely, thoughtful gesture without any manual effort.\n\n## **For Whom**\nThis workflow is perfect for **e-commerce store owners, small businesses, and marketing teams** who want to increase customer retention and sales through personalized marketing. It is especially valuable for those who have a growing customer list and need to scale their customer engagement efforts efficiently.\n\n## **Scope**\n* **What it includes:**\n    * A daily scheduled check to scan your customer list.\n    * Automated lookup of customers celebrating their birthday on the current day.\n    * Automatic generation of a unique, single-use discount code.\n    * Personalized email delivery of the birthday message and discount code.\n\n* **What it excludes:**\n    * Integration with your e-commerce platform's coupon system (the code generation is a placeholder and would require manual creation in your platform's backend).\n    * Advanced segmentation (e.g., sending different offers to different customer tiers).\n    * Follow-up emails or drip campaigns.\n\n## ⚙ **How to Set Up**\n\n1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need an n8n instance, a **Google Sheets** spreadsheet with customer data (including a 'birthday' column in 'MM-dd' format), and a **Gmail** account.\n2.  **Workflow Import:** Import the provided JSON file into your n8n instance.\n3.  **Credential Configuration:**\n    * Set up credentials for **Google Sheets** and **Gmail** within n8n.\n4.  **Node-Specific Configuration:**\n    * **`Daily Schedule`:** No changes needed. It is pre-configured to run every day at 9 AM.\n    * **`Get Customer Data`:** Input the **Spreadsheet ID** and **Sheet Name** of your customer database.\n    * **`Is It Their Birthday?`:** Ensure the value in `value1` `={{ $json.birthday }}` matches the name of your birthday column in Google Sheets.\n    * **`Send Birthday Email`:** Customize the **`fromEmail`** and the body of the email to match your brand's voice.\n5.  **Activation:** After all configurations are complete, click **\"Save\"** and then **\"Active\"**. The workflow will now run every day to delight your customers."
