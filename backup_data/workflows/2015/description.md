**How it works**
This workflow can be divided into four steps :

    1. The workflow initiates with a manual trigger (On clicking ‘execute’).
    2. It reads your Google Sheet file.
    3. It connects to your Icypeas account.
    4. It performs an HTTP request to scan the domains/companies.

**Set up steps**
    1. You will need a formated Google sheet file with company/domain names. 
    2. You will need a working icypeas account to run the workflow and get your API Key, API Secret and User ID.
    3. You will need domain/companies names to scan them.
