## 🎧 Upload Podcast Episodes to Spotify via RSS & Google Drive

Skip the manual steps and publish your podcast episodes to Spotify in minutes — fully automated.

This workflow takes your finished audio, uploads it to Google Drive, updates your podcast’s RSS feed in GitHub, and pushes it live on Spotify and other platforms linked to that feed. No more copy-pasting links or manually editing XML files — everything happens in one click.

It’s perfect for podcasters who already have an RSS feed connected to Spotify for Podcasters and want a repeatable, hands-free publishing process.

💡 **What this workflow does**  
✅ Reads your finished MP3 from a local path or previous automation step  
☁️ Uploads the audio to Google Drive and creates a public share link  
📄 Fetches your existing `rss.xml` file from GitHub  
➕ Appends a new `&lt;item&gt;` entry with title, description, publication date, and MP3 link  
🔄 Commits the updated RSS file back to GitHub, triggering updates on Spotify  
🎯 Ensures your episode appears on Spotify once your RSS is already linked in Spotify for Podcasters
