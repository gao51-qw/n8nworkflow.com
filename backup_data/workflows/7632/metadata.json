  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n## Who’s it for\n\nCommunity managers, content marketers, and builders who want a daily, skimmable update from a subreddit—automatically summarized, formatted, and cross-posted to DEV Community.\n\nHere is a [Link to video hackathon detailing this build.](https://youtube.com/live/5oAnKSCP4do) \n\n## What it does\n\n* Collects fresh posts from a subreddit (seeded via RSS).\n* Uses the **Bright Data** node to batch-scrape each post for richer fields (upvotes, comment count, comments).\n* Flattens comments/replies with **JMESPath** and trims payload size.\n* Summarizes into a Morning Brew–style brief (Top Stories, Quick Hits, Community Q\\&A, Comment Spotlight).\n* Converts to clean **Markdown** and **publishes to DEV** with **HTTP Request**.\n* Optional: emails the same digest via Gmail.\n\n## How to set up\n\n1. **Trigger**: Start with Manual Trigger; swap to **Cron** (daily) when ready.\n2. **RSS → URLs**: Set the subreddit RSS of your choice, just add .rss to the end of the subreddit URL.\n3. **Update AI Prompt to fit your needs** \n\n## Requirements\n\n* DEV Community API key.\n* Bright Data account + the Bright Data api key [Found Here](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users).\n* Optional: LLM provider credentials (OpenAI, Gemini).\n\n## How to customize\n\n* Swap DEV publishing for email/Slack; or post both.\n* Add more subreddits and **dedupe by URL**.\n\n## Best practices\n\n* **No hardcoded API keys**—use credentials.\n* Pin long-running outputs while building to save credits.\n* Only collect **publicly available data** with Bright Data.\n",
