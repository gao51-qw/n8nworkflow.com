I’m [Samir](https://samirsaci.com), a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).\n\nI help companies monitor and reduce their environmental footprint by combining **AI automation**, **carbon estimation APIs**, and **workflow automation**.\n\nThis workflow is part of our **sustainability reporting initiative**, allowing businesses to **track the CO₂ emissions of employee flights**.\n\n&gt; Automate carbon tracking for your business travel with AI-powered workflows in n8n!\n\n📬 For business inquiries, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-saci)\n\n### Who is this template for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for **travel managers**, **sustainability teams**, or **finance teams** who need to measure and report on emissions from business travel.\n\nLet’s imagine your company receives a **flight confirmation email**:\n\n[![Example Email](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-17.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\nThe **AI Agent** reads the email and extracts structured data, such as **flight dates, airport codes, and number of passengers**.\n\nThen, the **Carbon Interface API** is called to estimate **CO₂ emissions**, which are stored in a **Google Sheet** for sustainability reporting.\n\n[![Workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-18.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThis workflow automates the end-to-end process of **tracking flight emissions** from email to CO₂ estimation:\n\n- 📨 Gmail Trigger captures booking confirmations  \n- 🧠 AI Agent extracts structured data (airports, dates, flight numbers)  \n- ✈️ Each flight leg is processed individually  \n- 🌍 Carbon Interface API returns distance and carbon emissions  \n- 📄 A second Google Sheet node appends the emission data for reporting\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. 💌 Trigger on new flight confirmation email  \n2. 🧠 Extract structured trip data using AI Agent (flights, airports, dates)  \n3. 📑 Store flight metadata in Google Sheets  \n4. 🧭 For each leg, call the Carbon Interface API  \n5. 📥 Append distance, CO₂ in kg, and timestamp to the flight row  \n\n[![workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/06/image-19.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\n### What do I need to get started?\n\nYou’ll need:\n\n- A **Gmail account** receiving SAP Concur or travel confirmation emails  \n- A **Google Sheet** to record trip metadata and CO₂ emissions  \n- A free [Carbon Interface API key](https://www.carboninterface.com/docs)  \n- Access to OpenAI for parsing the email via AI Agent  \n- A few sample flight confirmation emails to test\n\n### 📺 Learn More with n8n Tutorials \n\nGet hands-on experience with automation through my comprehensive **n8n tutorial playlist**, featuring 18+ complete, step-by-step videos and ready-to-use templates.\n\n[![n8n Playlist](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-9.png)](https://bit.ly/playlist-n8n-supplyscience)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n🗒️ Use the sticky notes in the n8n canvas to:\n\n- Add your Gmail and Carbon Interface credentials  \n- Send a sample booking email to your inbox  \n- Verify that emissions and distances are correctly added to your sheet  \n\n*This template was built using n8n v1.93.0*  \n*Submitted: June 7, 2025*\n",
