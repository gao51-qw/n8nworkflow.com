## How it works

- Receive a chat input as an image prompt.
- Call OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` API to generate an image.
- Split the returned images and process them one by one.
- Upload each generated image to **Google Drive**.
- Save image links and thumbnails to a **Google Sheets** document.
- Record token usage and estimated cost into a separate sheet.

## Set up steps

1. Connect your **OpenAI API** credentials for image generation.
2. Connect your **Google Drive** and **Google Sheets** accounts.
3. Set the destination folder in Google Drive.
4. Set the target Google Sheet and specify the correct sheet tabs.
5. The setup usually takes around **5-10 minutes**.
6. Detailed field mappings are already pre-configured inside the workflow.
7. Additional tips and instructions are included as **sticky notes** inside the workflow.
