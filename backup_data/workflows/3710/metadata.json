Connect your **OpenAI API** credentials for image generation.\n2. Connect your **Google Drive** and **Google Sheets** accounts.\n3. Set the destination folder in Google Drive.\n4. Set the target Google Sheet and specify the correct sheet tabs.\n5. The setup usually takes around **5-10 minutes**.\n6. Detailed field mappings are already pre-configured inside the workflow.\n7. Additional tips and instructions are included as **sticky notes** inside the workflow.\n\n![Screenshot_20250425_190410_NRnD1vZE2x 2.jpg](fileId:1166)\n\n## Google Sheet copy url\n[Copy Sheet Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zsWBgeA7I5Q_gsocz6hmkW884QT_vfz_mgGCT54VSN0/copy)",
