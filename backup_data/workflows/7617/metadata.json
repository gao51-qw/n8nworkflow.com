  "description": "*This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n.*\n\n# Generate dynamic email sequences with runtime context and external data\n\n## Who is this for?\nGrowth teams, sales development reps, and outbound marketers who want to reference specific, real-time information about prospects in their email sequences. Built for teams that have access to external data sources and want to create truly contextualized outreach that feels impossibly relevant.\n\n## What problem does this solve?\nMost outbound sequences are static - they use the same messaging for everyone regardless of what's actually happening at the prospect's company right now. You might know they're hiring, launched a product, got funding, or expanded to new markets, but your email sequences can't dynamically reference these timely events. This workflow shows how to inject real-time external context into Octave's sequence generation, creating outreach that feels like you're personally monitoring each prospect's company.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n**Lead Data & Context Collection:**\n- Receives lead information via webhook (firstName, companyName, companyDomain, profileURL, jobTitle)\n- Uses external data sources to gather timely context about the prospect's company\n- Example: AI agent researches current job postings to find roles they're actively hiring for\n- Processes this context into structured data for sequence generation\n\n**Runtime Context Integration:**\n- Feeds external context into Octave's sequence generation as \"runtime context\"\n- Defines both WHAT the context is (\"they are hiring a software engineer\") and HOW to use it (\"mention the role in the opening\")\n- Allows Octave to weave timely, relevant details into each email naturally\n- Creates sequences that feel like personal research rather than mass outreach\n\n**Dynamic Sequence Generation:**\n- Leverages Octave's context engine plus runtime data to create hyper-relevant sequences (1-7 emails)\n- Generates subject lines and email content that reference specific, current company context\n- Maintains your positioning and value prop while incorporating timely relevance\n- Creates messaging that feels unmistakably meant for that specific moment in the prospect's business\n\n**Campaign Integration:**\n- Automatically adds leads with contextualized sequences to your email platform\n- Maps generated content to campaign variables for automated sending\n- Supports multiple email platforms with easy customization\n\n## Setup\n\n**Required Credentials:**\n- Octave API key and workspace access\n- External data source API (job boards, news APIs, enrichment services, etc.)\n- Email platform API key (Instantly.ai configured, easily adaptable)\n- Optional: LLM credentials if using the example AI agent for testing\n\n**Step-by-Step Configuration:**\n\n1. **Set up External Data Source:**\n   - Replace the AI Agent with your preferred data source (job board APIs, news APIs, company databases)\n   - Configure data collection to find relevant, timely information about prospects\n   - Structure the output to provide clean context for sequence generation\n\n2. **Set up Octave Sequence Agent:**\n   - Add your Octave API credentials in n8n\n   - Replace `your-octave-sequence-agent-id` with your actual sequence agent ID\n   - Configure runtime context parameters:\n     - **Runtime Context:** Define WHAT the external data represents\n     - **Runtime Instructions:** Specify HOW to use it in the messaging\n\n3. **Configure Email Platform:**\n   - Add your email platform API credentials\n   - Replace `your-campaign-id-here` with your actual campaign ID\n   - Ensure campaign supports custom variables for dynamic content\n\n4. **Set up Lead Source:**\n   - Replace `your-webhook-path-here` with a unique, secure path\n   - Configure your lead source to send prospect data to the webhook\n   - Test end-to-end flow with sample leads\n\n**Required Webhook Payload Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"body\": {\n    \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Chen\",\n    \"companyName\": \"InnovateTech\",\n    \"companyDomain\": \"innovatetech.com\",\n    \"profileURL\": \"https://linkedin.com/in/alexchen\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@innovatetech.com\",\n    \"jobTitle\": \"VP of Engineering\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## How to customize\n\n**External Data Sources:** Replace the AI agent with your preferred context collection method:\n- **Job Board APIs:** Reference current hiring needs and team expansion\n- **News APIs:** Mention recent company announcements, funding, or product launches\n- **Social Media Monitoring:** Reference recent LinkedIn posts, company updates, or industry discussions\n- **Enrichment Services:** Pull real-time company data, technology stack changes, or market expansion\n\n**Runtime Context Configuration:** Customize how external data integrates with sequences:\n- **Context Definition:** Specify what the external data represents (\"they just raised Series B funding\")\n- **Usage Instructions:** Define how to incorporate it (\"mention the funding in the opening and tie it to growth challenges\")\n- **Email-Level Control:** Configure different context usage for different emails in the sequence\n- **Global vs. Specific:** Apply context to all emails or target specific messages\n\n**Data Processing:** Replace the example AI agent with your external data processing:\n- Modify data source connections to pull relevant context\n- Ensure consistent output formatting for runtime context integration\n- Add error handling for cases where external data isn't available\n- Implement fallback context for prospects without relevant external data\n\n**Sequence Customization:** Configure Octave sequence generation:\n- **Core Context (Library):** Define your personas, use cases, and offering definitions\n- **Strategy (Playbooks):** Configure messaging frameworks and value proposition delivery\n- **Writing Style (Agent):** Adjust tone, voice, and communication style\n\n**Email Platform Integration:** Adapt for different email sequencing platforms:\n- Update API endpoints and authentication for your preferred platform\n- Modify variable mapping for platform-specific custom fields\n- Adjust sequence length and formatting requirements\n\n## Use Cases\n- Job posting-triggered outreach for hiring managers and HR teams\n- Funding announcement follow-ups for growth-stage companies\n- Product launch congratulations with relevant use case discussions\n- Market expansion outreach when companies enter new territories\n- Technology adoption sequences based on recent stack additions\n- Event attendance follow-ups with session-specific references",
