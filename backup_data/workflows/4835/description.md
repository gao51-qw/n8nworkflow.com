# Overview

This n8n workflow template enables automatic enrichment of company information in your Google Sheets. When you add a new company or update existing company details (name or website), the workflow automatically fetches additional business intelligence data using Explorium MCP and updates your sheet with:

* Business ID
* NAICS industry code
* Number of employees (range)
* Annual revenue (range)

# Key Features

* **Automatic Triggering**: Monitors your Google Sheet for new rows or updates to company name/website fields
* **Smart Processing**: Only processes new or modified rows, not the entire sheet
* **Data Validation**: Ensures both company name and website are present before processing
* **Error Handling**: Processes each row individually to prevent one failure from affecting others
* **Powered by AI**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 with Explorium MCP for intelligent data enrichment

# Prerequisites

Before setting up this workflow, ensure you have:

1. **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud)
2. **Google account** with access to Google Sheets
3. **Anthropic API key** for Claude
4. ***Explorium MCP API key***

## Step 7: Activate the Workflow

1. Click the **Active** toggle in the top right to activate the workflow
2. The workflow will now monitor your sheet every minute for changes

# How It Works

## Workflow Process Flow

1. **Google Sheets Trigger**: Polls your sheet every minute for new rows or changes to name/website fields
2. **Filter Valid Rows**: Validates that both company name and website are present
3. **Loop Over Items**: Processes each company individually
4. **AI Agent**: Uses Explorium MCP to:
   * Find the company's business ID
   * Retrieve firmographic data (revenue, employees, NAICS code)
5. **Format Output**: Structures the data for Google Sheets
6. **Update Company Row**: Writes the enriched data back to the original row

## Trigger Behavior

* **First Activation**: May process all existing rows to establish a baseline
* **Ongoing Operation**: Only processes new rows or rows where name/website fields change
* **Polling Frequency**: Checks for changes every minute

# Usage

## Adding New Companies

1. Add a new row to your Google Sheet
2. Fill in the `name` and `website` columns
3. Within 1 minute, the workflow will automatically:
   * Detect the new row
   * Enrich the company data
   * Update the remaining columns

## Updating Existing Companies

1. Modify the `name` or `website` field of an existing row
2. The workflow will re-process that row with the updated information
3. All enrichment data will be refreshed

## Monitoring Executions

1. In n8n, go to **Executions** to see workflow runs
2. Each execution shows:
   * Which rows were processed
   * Success/failure status
   * Detailed logs for troubleshooting

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

**All rows are processed instead of just new/updated ones**

* Ensure the workflow is **activated**, not just run manually
* Manual test runs will process all rows
* First activation may process all rows once

**No data is returned for a company**

* Verify the company name and website are correct
* Check if the company exists in Explorium's database
* Some smaller or newer companies may not have data available

**Workflow isn't triggering**

* Confirm the workflow is activated (Active toggle is ON)
* Check that changes are made to the `name` or `website` columns
* Verify Google Sheets credentials have proper permissions

**Authentication errors**

* Re-authenticate Google Sheets credentials
* Verify Anthropic API key is valid and has credits
* Check Explorium Bearer token is correct and active

## Error Handling

The workflow processes each row individually, so if one company fails to enrich:

* Other rows will still be processed
* The failed row will retain its original data
* Check the execution logs for specific error details

# Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure company names and websites are accurate for best results
2. **Website Format**: Include full URLs ([https://example.com](https://example.com)) rather than just domain names
3. **Batch Processing**: The workflow handles multiple updates efficiently, so you can add several companies at once
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Periodically check execution logs to ensure smooth operation

# API Limits & Considerations

* **Google Sheets API**: Subject to Google's API quotas
* **Anthropic API**: Each enrichment uses Claude Sonnet 4 tokens
* **Explorium MCP**: Rate limits may apply based on your subscription

# Support

For issues specific to:

* **n8n platform**: Consult n8n documentation or community
* **Google Sheets integration**: Check n8n's Google Sheets node documentation
* **Explorium MCP**: Contact Explorium support for API-related issues
* **Anthropic/Claude**: Refer to Anthropic's documentation for API issues

# Example Use Cases

1. **Sales Prospecting**: Automatically enrich lead lists with company size and revenue data
2. **Market Research**: Build comprehensive databases of companies in specific industries
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Track and monitor competitor information
4. **Investment Research**: Gather firmographic data for potential investment targets
