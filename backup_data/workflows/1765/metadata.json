  "description": "This workflow let's a bot in Slack notify a specific channel when a new product in WooCommerce is published and live on the site. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n[WooCommerce](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.woocommercetrigger/) account\n[Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/) and a [Slack bot](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace)\n\n## How it works\n\n1. Listen for WooCommerce product creation\n2. If permalink starts with https://[your-url-here].com/product/\n3. Slack bot notifies channel that a new product has been added. \n\nPlease note, you must update the URL in the IF node to match your url. If your WooCommerce doesn't use the slug /product/, that will need to be updated too. \n",
