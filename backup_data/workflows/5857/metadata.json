  "description": "### Chat with thing\n\nThis n8n template lets you build a smart AI chat assistant that can handle text, images, and PDFs — using OpenAI's GPT-4o multimodal model. It supports dynamic conversations and file analysis, making it great for AI-driven support bots, personal assistants, or embedded chat widgets.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 How it Works\n\n- The chat trigger node kicks off a session using n8n's hosted chat UI.\n- Users can send text or upload images or PDFs — the workflow checks if a file was included.\n- If an image is uploaded, the file is converted to base64 and analyzed using GPT-4o's vision capabilities.\n- GPT-4o generates a natural language description of the image and responds to the user's question in context.\n- A memory buffer keeps track of the conversation thread, so follow-up questions are handled intelligently.\n- OpenAI’s chat model handles both text-only and mixed media input seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 How to Use\n\n- You can embed this in a website or use it with your own webhook/chat interface.\n- The logic is modular — just swap out the `chatTrigger` node for another input (e.g. form or API).\n- To use with documents, you can modify the logic to pass PDF content to GPT-4 directly.\n- You can extend it with action nodes, e.g. saving results to Notion, Airtable, or sending replies via email or Slack.\n\n---\n\n### 🔐 Requirements\n\n- Your OpenAI GPT-4o API key\n- Set File Upload on the chat\n\n\n### 🚀 Use Cases\n\n- PDF explainer bot\n- Internal knowledge chat with media support\n- Personal assistant for mixed content",
