## OAuth Token Generator and Validator

This **n8n template** helps you generate, validate, and store tokens for your customers securely using:

- **n8n** as your backend automation engine  
- **Airtable** as your lightweight client and token store

---

### 🚀 What It Does

- Accepts `client_id` and `client_secret` via **POST webhook**.
- Validates client credentials against Airtable.
- Generates a **long token** on success.
- Stores the generated token in Airtable with metadata.
- Responds with a JSON containing the token, expiry, and type.
- Returns clear error messages if validation fails.

---

### How It Works

1. **Webhook node** receives `client_id` and `client_secret`.
2. **Validator (Code node)** checks:
   - Body contains only `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   - Rejects missing or extra fields.
3. **Airtable search**:
   - Looks up the `client_id`.
   - Rejects if not found.
4. **Secret validation (If node)**:
   - Compares provided `client_secret` with stored value.
   - Rejects if incorrect.
5. **Token generation (Code node)**:
   - Generates a 128-character secure token.
6. **Airtable create**:
   - Stores token, client ID, creation date, and type.
7. **Webhook response**:
   - Returns JSON `{ access_token, expires_in, token_type }` on success.
   - Returns appropriate JSON error messages on failure.
