- How it works:
The organizer continuously monitors your Gmail inbox. It analyzes sender and subject to categorize emails (Work, Purchases, Newsletter) and automatically applies labels. Based on the category, it performs specific actions, such as marking important emails or archiving newsletters.

- Set up steps:
The initial setup requires Gmail access permission and defining the categorization rules and desired actions for each email type. This process can be configured in approximately 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the complexity of the rules you wish to establish.
