**What this template does**

Batch-evaluates compliance controls from Google Sheets using the CyberPulse Compliance API. Each control is scored, mapped to selected frameworks, enriched with crosswalk mappings, and summarized with AI-generated findings and recommendations.

**How it works**

Read from Sheets → Build control text (response_text + implementation_notes) → CyberPulse Compliance (scoring, mapping, AI summary) → Normalize → Append results to Sheets.

**Setup (5–10 min)**

Add Google Sheets + CyberPulse HTTP Header Auth credentials.

Replace YOUR_SHEET_ID and sheet names.

Provide your Crosswalk JSON URL (raw GitHub or API endpoint) or use this url: https://www.cyberpulsesolutions.com/xw.json

Select frameworks to evaluate against.

Run a small test, then full batch.

**CyberPulse API (required for production)**

Use hosted scoring/mapping (no local ML code).

Create a CyberPulse HTTP Header Auth credential with API Key.

In the node: paste Crosswalk URL, select frameworks, set credential.

For large sheets, add a short Wait or reduce batch size.
