  "description": "How it works\n\nThis workflow automatically extracts specific data from received emails and saves it into a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and analysis.\n\nIt connects to a Gmail account, searches for emails received within a defined date range from a specific sender, opens links inside those emails, extracts data from the linked pages (such as case ID, patient name, birth date, complaint, and location), processes and cleans the information using custom JavaScript logic, and finally saves the structured results into a Google Sheet.\n\nSetup steps\n\nConnect Gmail using OAuth2 credentials.\n\nAdjust the date filters and sender email in the “Search Emails” node.\n\nCustomize the CSS selectors in the HTML extraction nodes to match the desired elements from your email or linked page.\n\nOpen the Code node and modify the logic if you need to calculate or transform additional fields.\n\nLink your Google Sheets account and specify the spreadsheet and sheet name where the results will be appended.",
