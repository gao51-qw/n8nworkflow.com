## What if your quote requests managed themselves?

Every quote request is a potential deal — but only if it's handled quickly, properly, and without things falling through the cracks. What if instead of copy-pasting emails and pinging teammates manually, your entire process just... ran itself?

This automation makes it happen: it captures form submissions, notifies your sales team on Slack, stores leads in Airtable, and sends an email confirmation to the client — all in one seamless n8n flow.

## ⚙️ Tools used

* **Tally** – to collect client quote requests
* **n8n** – to automate everything, no code needed
* **Airtable** – to store leads and track status
* **Slack** – to instantly notify your sales team
* **Gmail** – to confirm the request with the client

## 🧩 Flow structure overview

1. Trigger from a Tally form using a webhook
2. Extract and format the data
3. Create a new record in Airtable
4. Send a message to Slack
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Send an email confirmation via Gmail

---

## 📥 Step 1 – Webhook (Tally)

This node listens for incoming quote requests from the Tally form.

* **HTTP Method:** POST
* **Path:** /Request a Quote
* **Authentication:** None
* **Respond:** Immediately

The data arrives as an array inside `body.data.fields`. Each field has a `label` and a `value` that we’ll need to map manually.

---

## 🧹 Step 2 – Edit Fields (Set)

This step extracts usable values from the raw form data.

Example mapping:

```
Name = {{ $json.body.data.fields[0].label }}
Email Address = {{ $json.body.data.fields[1].value }}
Type of Service Needed = {{ $json.body.data.fields[2].value }}
Estimated Budget = {{ $json.body.data.fields[3].value }}
Preferred Timeline = {{ $json.body.data.fields[4].value }}
Additional Details or Questions = {{ $json.body.data.fields[5].value }}
```

---

## 📊 Step 3 – Create record in Airtable

We send the cleaned fields into a database (CRM) in Airtable.

* **Operation:** Create
* **Base & Table:** Request a Quote - Airtable Base
* **Mapping:** Manual field-to-column matching

Each quote submission becomes a new record with all project details.

## 📣 Step 4 – Send a message to Slack

This node notifies your sales team immediately in a Slack channel.

Message format:

```
:new: *New quote request received!*

👤 Name: {{ $json.fields.Name }}
📧 Email: {{ $json.fields.Email }}
💼 Service: {{ $json.fields["Type of Service"] }}
💰 Budget: {{ $json.fields["Estimated Budget (€)"] }}
⏱️ Timeline: {{ $json.fields["Preferred Timeline"] }}
📝 Notes: {{ $json.fields["Additional Details"] }}
```

---

## ⏳ Step 5 – Wait 5 minutes

This node simply delays the email by 5 minutes.
Why? To give a human salesperson time to reach out manually before the automated confirmation goes out. It adds a personal buffer.

---

## 📧 Step 6 – Send confirmation via Gmail

* **To:** {{ \$('Edit Fields').item.json\["Email Address"] }}
* **Subject:** Thanks for your quote request 🙌
* **Email Type:** HTML

Message body:

```
Hi {{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Name }},

Thanks a lot for your quote request — we’ve received your information!

Our team will get back to you within the next 24 hours to discuss your project.

Talk soon,  
— The WebExperts Team
