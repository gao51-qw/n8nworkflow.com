This is a workflow where a support channel on Telegram is being used to gather customer feedback. Depending on certain keywords in the customer's message, this workflow creates a ticket with a tag in your Freshdesk instance. The customer is then sent a message on Telegram and an item is created on Monday.com for tracking.
