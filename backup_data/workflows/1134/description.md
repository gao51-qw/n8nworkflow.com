**Telegram Trigger node:** This node will trigger the workflow when a message is sent to the bot. If you want to trigger the workflow via a different messaging platform or a service, replace the Telegram Trigger node with the Trigger node of that service.

**IF node** The IF node checks for the incoming command. If the command is not `deploy`, the IF node will return false, otherwise true.

**Set node:** This node extracts the value of the version from the Telegram message and sets the value. This value is used later in the workflow.

**GitHub node:** This node creates a new version release. It uses the version from the Set node to create the tag.

**NoOp node:** Adding this node is optional.
