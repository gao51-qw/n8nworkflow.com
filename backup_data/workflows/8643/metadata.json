  "description": "\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nThis workflow is designed for software teams, project managers, and\ndevelopers who manage work across Azure DevOps and GitHub. It helps\norganizations that use Azure DevOps for work item tracking but rely on\nGitHub for issue management and collaboration.\n\nIf you need to ensure that your DevOps Stories and Tasks are mirrored in\nGitHub issues while keeping a single source of truth in Google Sheets,\nthis workflow is for you.\n\n## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case\n\nManaging projects across multiple platforms often leads to missed\nupdates and poor traceability.\n\n-   Stories created in Azure DevOps may not be tracked properly in\n    GitHub.\\\n-   Tasks under Stories often lose visibility when teams split between\n    platforms.\\\n-   Manual syncing between tools takes time and causes human errors.\n\nThis workflow solves that problem by automating the sync between Azure\nDevOps Stories and GitHub Issues, while also keeping a Google Sheets\nrecord for cross-referencing and reporting.\n\n## What this workflow does\n\n1.  **Triggers from Azure DevOps Stories** -- When a Story is created or\n    updated, the workflow is activated.\\\n2.  **Creates a GitHub Issue** -- A new issue is generated in the\n    specified GitHub repository.\\\n3.  **Assigns a random collaborator** -- One repository collaborator is\n    randomly assigned to the issue.\\\n4.  **Logs mapping in Google Sheets** -- The Azure DevOps Story ID,\n    GitHub Issue number, and URL are stored for tracking.\\\n5.  **Triggers from Azure DevOps Tasks** -- When a Task linked to a\n    Story is created, the workflow looks up its parent in Google\n    Sheets.\\\n6.  **Updates the GitHub Issue** -- The parent GitHub Issue is updated\n    with a clickable link to the new Task for better visibility.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Connect your accounts\n\n-   GitHub (OAuth2 or personal token)\\\n-   Google Sheets (OAuth2)\\\n-   Azure DevOps (Webhook integration)\n\n### Configure Webhooks\n\n-   Add the workflow's webhook URLs to Azure DevOps service hooks for\n    Work Item Created/Updated events.\n\n### Update repository details\n\n-   Set the GitHub repository where issues should be created.\n\n### Customize Sheets\n\n-   Use the provided Google Sheet or link your own for issue mappings.\n\n## How to customize this workflow to your needs\n\n-   **Modify assignment logic**: Instead of random collaborator\n    assignment, edit the Code node to assign issues based on workload or\n    labels.\\\n-   **Change Sheet schema**: Add more fields (e.g., State,\n    IterationPath) to your Google Sheet for richer reporting.\\\n-   **Expand task linking**: Customize the way Tasks are appended to\n    GitHub issues (e.g., group by state, show due dates).\n\n## Powered By Concept Recall\n\n[https://conceptrecall.com](https://conceptrecall.com/)\n",
