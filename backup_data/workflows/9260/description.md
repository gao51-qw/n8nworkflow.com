# Customer Support Ticket Documentation Automation

Automatically transform resolved support tickets into professional, AI-powered PDF documentation with complete tracking and team notifications.

---

## Overview

This workflow automates the entire process of documenting resolved support tickets — from receiving ticket data to generating professional PDF case studies, storing them in Google Drive, tracking in spreadsheets, and notifying your team.

Powered by AI, it creates consistent, high-quality documentation that can be reused for knowledge base articles, training materials, and compliance records.

1. **Receives** resolved support tickets via webhook from your support platform

   * Problem description
   * Troubleshooting steps taken
   * Final resolution
   * Key takeaways and prevention tips
4. **Creates professional PDF documents** with branded HTML templates
5. **Uploads PDFs** to organized Google Drive folders
6. **Tracks all tickets** in a Google Sheets database for reporting and analytics
7. **Sends Slack notifications** to your team with links to completed documentation
8. **Handles errors gracefully** with automatic alerts when issues occur

* Clickable PDF link
* Timestamp

---

## Performance

* **Processing Time:** 10–20 seconds/ticket
* **Capacity:** 100+ tickets/day
* **PDF Size:** 50–300 KB

---

## Troubleshooting

**Webhook not triggering** → Check webhook URL, trigger conditions, and public access.
**PDF generation fails** → Verify HTML syntax and PDFMunk API key.
**Google Drive upload fails** → Re-authenticate credentials or check folder permissions.
**Slack notification missing** → Ensure bot token, scopes, and channel ID are valid.
**Data extraction errors** → Adjust field mappings or inspect payload format.

---

## Best Practices

1. Test before production rollout
2. Monitor first-week error logs
3. Organize Drive by date/priority
4. Validate Sheets columns
5. Use a dedicated Slack channel
6. Archive old PDFs regularly
7. Review AI summaries weekly
8. Document configuration changes

---

## Security Notes

* All credentials stored securely in n8n
* PDF links are restricted by Drive sharing settings
* Webhooks use HTTPS for secure data transfer
* No sensitive info logged in error messages

---

## Future Enhancements

* Multi-language summaries
* Integration with Confluence or Notion
* Customer satisfaction feedback link
* ML-based issue categorization
