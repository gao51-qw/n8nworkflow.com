    "description": "# AI Chatbot with Conditional Execution for Cost Efficiency  \n\n## Description  \n\nThis **n8n workflow** implements an **AI-powered chatbot** that **only runs when a chat is initiated on a website**. By introducing a conditional step, the workflow ensures that **AI tokens are not consumed unnecessarily**, making it a cost-efficient and resource-optimized solution.  \n\nThe chatbot, named **Sophia**, serves as an **interactive assistant for SyncBricks**. It helps users with **guest posting services, YouTube review videos, IT consultancy, and online courses** while collecting user details step by step. The chatbot ensures that inquiries are properly logged and confirmed before proceeding to AI-driven responses.  \n\nThis template is ideal for **businesses, service providers, and content creators** who want to **optimize AI token usage** while delivering **personalized, interactive engagement** with their users.  \n\n## Features  \n\n1. **Conditional Execution** – The AI chatbot **only activates when a chat is initiated**, avoiding unnecessary API calls.  \n2. **AI-Powered Conversations** – Uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate human-like responses.  \n3. **Step-by-Step Data Collection** – Ensures **structured user input**, requesting **name, email, and request type** sequentially.  \n4. **Memory Buffer for Context Awareness** – Maintains conversation context using a **window buffer memory** system.  \n5. **Multiple Service Offerings** – Supports inquiries related to:  \n   - **Guest Posting Services**  \n   - **YouTube Review Videos**  \n   - **Online Courses on Udemy**  \n   - **IT Consultancy Services**  \n6. **Automated Confirmation Messages** – After collecting user details, sends a **confirmation message** summarizing the request.  \n\n## How It Works  \n\n1. **Chat Message Trigger**  \n   - The workflow starts **only when a chat message is received** from the website.  \n   - This ensures **no AI token is consumed unless a user initiates a chat**.  \n\n2. **Condition Check: Is Chat Input Provided?**  \n   - The workflow checks if **chat input is non-empty**.  \n   - If the chat input is empty, **the workflow stops**, ensuring **no unnecessary API usage**.  \n   - If a message is detected, **the chatbot continues** processing.  \n\n3. **AI-Powered Chat Response**  \n   - The chatbot, **Sophia**, generates **personalized responses** using **Google Gemini AI**.  \n   - AI ensures **structured conversation flow** by collecting:  \n     - **User’s Full Name**  \n     - **Email ID**  \n     - **Request Type**  \n\n4. **Memory Buffer for Context Retention**  \n   - A **Window Buffer Memory** system **stores chat history** and **retrieves previous responses** to ensure **context-aware conversations**.  \n\n5. **Response Optimization**  \n   - **Checks memory** to avoid **asking the same question twice**.  \n   - If details are already provided, **Sophia moves directly to processing the request**.  \n\n6. **Confirmation & User Engagement**  \n   - After collecting the required details, Sophia **summarizes the request** as follows:  \n     - *\"Got it [Name], your request is [Request Type]. I will be sending the details to your email ID: [Email]. Hold on while I send confirmation.\"*  \n\n7. **Final Confirmation Message**  \n   - Ensures the **user receives a proper acknowledgment** of their inquiry.  \n\n## Prerequisites  \n\nBefore using this workflow, make sure you have:  \n\n1. **n8n Instance** (Cloud or Self-Hosted)  \n2. **Google Gemini API Key** (For AI-generated responses)  \n3. **Webhook Integration** (To trigger the chatbot from your website)  \n\n## Use Cases  \n\n1. **Businesses & Enterprises** – AI-powered lead qualification for services.  \n2. **Bloggers & Content Creators** – Automated **guest post** inquiry handling.  \n3. **YouTube Influencers & Educators** – AI chatbot to promote courses and review services.  \n4. **Marketing Agencies** – Lead generation chatbot **without excessive AI token consumption**.  \n5. **E-Commerce & Consulting Services** – AI-driven **personalized customer engagement**.  \n\n## Nodes Used in This Workflow  \n\n1. **Chat Trigger (Webhook)** – Initiates only when a user sends a chat message.  \n2. **Conditional Check (If Node)** – Ensures AI is **only used when a chat is initiated**.  \n3. **AI Agent (Google Gemini AI)** – Generates **intelligent chatbot responses**.  \n4. **Memory Buffer (Context Retention)** – Stores user inputs for **context-aware conversations**.  \n\n## Important\n### [Start with n8n](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-n8n-ai-agents-api-automation-webhooks-no-code/?referralCode=0309FD70BE2D72630C09)  \n\n### [Learn n8n with Amjid ](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-n8n-ai-agents-api-automation-webhooks-no-code/?referralCode=0309FD70BE2D72630C09)  \n### [Get n8n Book](https://lms.syncbricks.com/books/n8n/) \n\n### [What is Proxmox](https://www.udemy.com/course/proxmox-virtualization-environment-complete-training/?referralCode=8E7EAFD11C2389F89C11)\n\n## Creator Information  \n\n**Developed by:** Amjid Ali  \n**Website:** [SyncBricks](https://syncbricks.com)  \n**Email:** [amjid@amjidali.com](mailto:amjid@amjidali.com)  \n**LinkedIn:** [Amjid Ali](https://linkedin.com/in/amjidali)  \n**YouTube:** [SyncBricks](https://youtube.com/@syncbricks)  \n\n## Support & Contributions  \n\nIf you find this workflow helpful, consider **supporting my work**:  \n\n[Donate via PayPal](http://paypal.me/pmptraining)  \n\nFor **full courses on n8n**, visit:  \n\n[Course by Amjid](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-n8n-ai-agents-api-automation-webhooks-no-code/?referralCode=0309FD70BE2D72630C09)  \n\n## Final Thoughts  \n\nThis **n8n workflow** ensures **optimal AI token usage** while **engaging users with an intelligent chatbot**.
