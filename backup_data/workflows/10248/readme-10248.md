## 📖 Description

An intelligent geopolitical monitoring system that filters 200+ daily news articles down to only the critical breaking news that matters to you. This workflow uses smart keyword filtering and AI-powered scoring to eliminate noise, reduce AI costs, and deliver only high-priority geopolitical alerts to Telegram.

**The Problem:** Traditional news monitoring is overwhelming - hundreds of articles per hour, 95% irrelevant to your region of interest, no urgency prioritization, and critical breaking news gets buried in noise.

**The Solution:** This workflow combines dual-layer filtering (primary + secondary keywords) with AI scoring to distinguish actual breaking news from general news coverage. By filtering first and scoring second, you reduce AI API costs by 80-90% while ensuring you never miss critical geopolitical developments. Switch between monitoring India, China, Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, or any region by simply changing a configuration file.

Perfect for government analysts, corporate security teams, investment research firms, news organizations, or anyone who needs to stay informed about geopolitical developments without information overload.

3. **Import workflow** (22 nodes ready to configure)
4. **Configure nodes:**
   - Update Google Drive config URL with your file ID
   - Update 6 RSS Feed URLs for your region
   - Link 3 Data Table nodes to `analyzed_articles` table
5. **Add credentials** (OpenAI API, Telegram Bot)
6. **Set schedule** (15min-daily based on monitoring needs)
7. **Test workflow** (verify filtering, scoring, alerts work)
8. **Activate** (workflow runs automatically on schedule)

**Quick Start Result:**
- ✅ 200+ articles processed → 5-7 filtered → 3-5 scored → 1-3 alerts sent
- ✅ Telegram receives consolidated breaking news message
- ✅ Workflow runs every 30min (or your chosen interval)

## 📊 Workflow Stats

- **Nodes:** 22
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Execution Time:** ~30-60 seconds per run
- **Monthly Cost:** $3-5 (OpenAI API usage only)
- **Maintenance:** Minimal (update RSS feeds if sources change)
- **Scalability:** Handles 200+ articles per execution, easily scales to 10+ RSS feeds

## 🎨 Customization Options

- **Add more regions:** Create new config JSON files for North Korea, Taiwan, Africa, Latin America, etc.
- **Multi-channel alerts:** Extend to Slack, WhatsApp, Email, Discord, Microsoft Teams, SMS
- **Severity-based routing:** Send critical alerts (score 9-10) via SMS, others to Telegram
- **Custom scoring models:** Switch between GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, Claude based on config
- **Exclude keywords:** Add "exclude_keywords" array to filter out sports, entertainment, weather
- **Alert digest mode:** Aggregate alerts into daily/weekly summary emails instead of real-time
- **Dashboard integration:** Connect to Grafana or Metabase for visual trend analysis
- **Webhook triggers:** Use workflow output to trigger other n8n workflows or external systems
- **Custom RSS feeds:** Add industry-specific or regional news sources
- **Adjust alert threshold:** Change from score &gt;= 6 to higher/lower based on notification preferences

## 🔧 How it Works

1. **Schedule Trigger (Configurable):**
   - Workflow runs at your configured interval (15min, 30min, 1hr, 3hr, daily, etc.)
   - Trigger frequency depends on use case: active conflicts need more frequent monitoring
2. **Config Loading:**
   - HTTP Request node fetches JSON config from Google Drive
   - Config contains: keywords, scoring rules, AI role, alert threshold, Telegram chat ID
3. **RSS Aggregation:**
   - 6 RSS Feed nodes fetch articles from international news sources
   - Merge node combines all feeds (~200 articles per execution)
   - RSS Cleanup node strips HTML and normalizes to 5 fields (60-75% size reduction)
4. **Smart Filtering (Cost Optimization Layer 1):**
   - Dynamic Filter checks PRIMARY keywords (geographic/entity: "india", "modi", "delhi")
   - Also checks SECONDARY keywords (event type: "military", "conflict", "trade deal")
   - **Both conditions required:** Article must mention at least one primary AND one secondary
   - **Result:** 200 articles reduced to ~5-7 relevant articles (95% reduction)
   - **Why this matters:** Eliminates noise BEFORE expensive AI scoring
5. **Duplicate Detection (Cost Optimization Layer 2):**
   - Queries Data Table for previously analyzed article links
   - Filters out articles already scored in last 7 days
   - **Result:** ~5-7 filtered articles reduced to ~3-5 new articles
   - **Why this matters:** Prevents redundant AI API calls (saves 80% on repeat articles)
6. **Dynamic AI Prompt Generation:**
   - Code node builds system prompt from config.ai_role and config.scoring_criteria
   - Instructs AI: "You are a geopolitical analyst for [REGION]. Score articles 1-10..."
   - Includes scoring rubric: 9-10 = Military Action, 7-8 = Trade/Economic, etc.
7. **AI Urgency Scoring (Breaking News Detection):**
   - Breaking News Analyzer (GPT-4o-mini) evaluates geopolitical urgency
   - Scores 1-10: Distinguishes genuine breaking news from routine coverage
   - Returns: score, category, reasoning, should_alert (true/false based on threshold)
   - **Cost:** ~$0.002 per article (only ~3-5 articles scored per execution)
8. **Alert Decision:**
   - IF node checks: should_alert === true (score &gt;= config.alert_threshold)
   - Only high-priority alerts proceed to Telegram
   - Articles below threshold are logged but not sent
9. **Alert Aggregation:**
   - Consolidates multiple breaking news alerts into single Telegram message
   - Groups by urgency score with color-coded emojis (🔴 9-10, 🟠 7-8, 🟡 6-7)
   - Includes: score, category, title, link for each alert
10. **Telegram Delivery:**
    - Sends consolidated alert to configured Telegram chat
    - Uses HTML formatting for bold text and clickable links
    - Chat ID dynamically loaded from config (different regions → different chats)

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start with Higher Threshold:** Begin with alert_threshold = 7 to avoid alert fatigue, lower to 6 after tuning keywords
- **Regional RSS Matters:** Use region-specific news sources for better coverage (e.g., Times of India for India, not just BBC/NYT)
- **Test Keywords First:** Run workflow manually with "Test Workflow" to verify keyword filtering before activating schedule
- **Monitor AI Costs:** Check OpenAI usage dashboard after first week to confirm ~$0.10/day cost estimate
- **Tune Secondary Keywords:** Add domain-specific terms to secondary keywords (e.g., "semiconductor" for tech supply chain monitoring)
- **Use Separate Configs for Critical Regions:** Clone workflow for high-priority regions instead of switching configs manually
- **Schedule Based on Time Zones:** Align execution intervals with business hours in monitored region (e.g., 9AM-6PM IST for India)
- **Clear Duplicates for Testing:** Manually clear analyzed_articles Data Table when testing new configs for fresh results
- **Backup Working Configs:** Export and version control config files before making major keyword changes
- **Consider Alert Fatigue:** Score 9-10 events are rare (0-1 per day), score 6-8 events are common (2-5 per day) - set threshold accordingly
