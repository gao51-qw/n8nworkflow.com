# AI Cost Estimation Chatbot (Conversational Dual-Agent + OCR Workflow)

## Overview
This workflow introduces a **conversational AI Cost Estimation Chatbot** with built-in **OCR document analysis** and **interactive form guidance**.  
It helps users and teams handle **pricing, measurement, and product configuration** for multiple categories such as **fabrics** and **tiles** — whether data comes from an uploaded invoice, a stored RFQ, or live user input.

The system blends **Mistral AI’s reasoning** with **n8n’s native tools** — **OCR Extract**, **Calculator**, **Supabase**, and **Gmail** — to deliver clear, step-by-step cost calculations.  
It automatically retrieves or parses OCR data, confirms details conversationally, performs unit conversions, and returns accurate estimates in real time.  
Escalation and recordkeeping are handled via Gmail and Supabase.
