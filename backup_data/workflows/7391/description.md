![Peliqan n8n Uniconta AI Agent.png](fileId:2107)

## How it works

This template is an end-to-end demo of an in-house AI agent that can answer a wide range of questions by retrieving information from the Uniconta ERP system. For example users can ask questions related to products, stock, accounting or any other type of information contained in Uniconta.

Peliqan.io is used as a "cache" of all Uniconta data. Peliqan uses one-click ELT to sync all data from Uniconta to the built-in data warehouse, allowing for fast & accurate queries. The AI agent uses Text-to-SQL to answer questions.

Text-to-SQL is performed via the Peliqan node, added as a tool to the AI Agent. The question of the user - in natural language - is converted to an SQL query by the AI Agent. The query is executed by Peliqan.io on the source Uniconta data and the result is interpreted by the AI Agent.
