  "title": "Generate contextual recommendations from Slack using Pinecone",
  "description": "This advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) automation template for n8n enables contextual, real-time recommendations using Slack messages as input. The workflow extracts referenced documents from Google Drive, performs semantic retrieval from Pinecone, and generates next-step advice using GPT-4o — tailored specifically for executives and knowledge workers.\n\nPerfect for AI copilots, Slack-based assistants, or CTO coaching tools, this no-code RAG implementation gives you the building blocks to combine unstructured inputs with memory-augmented intelligence.\n\n**What This Template Does**\n\n✅ Triggers from a Slack Message or Mention\nMonitors a Slack channel using a bot, capturing user input in real-time.\n🔍 Extracts Key Info from Message\nGPT-4o parses the message to identify the subject person and Google Drive link (if present).\n📥 Downloads File from Google Drive\nAutomatically fetches and extracts PDF content using the built-in extractor.\n📇 Retrieves Metadata from Google Sheets & Pinecone\n\nLooks up user ID from Google Sheets and retrieves context from Pinecone based on embeddings and reranking.\n\n🧠 Contextual Response via GPT-4o (RAG)\nCombines user data and document context to generate a single, actionable next step using a tightly scoped GPT-4o prompt.\n\n🛠️ Auto-Fixes & Structures Output\nEnsures formatted response with recommended_action, rationale, and optional risk_note.\n\n📨 Sends Final Output Back to Slack\nPosts the recommendation directly to the channel as a reply.\n\n**Required Integrations**\n\n- Slack Bot with channels:history & app_mentions:read\n- Google Drive OAuth for file fetching\n- Google Sheets for ID mapping\n- Pinecone for vector document retrieval\n- Azure OpenAI or OpenAI GPT-4o for language processing\n- (Optional) Cohere for reranking results\n\n**Ideal Use Cases**\n\n🧑‍💼 Executive coaching bots (e.g., for CTOs or founders)\n🧠 Slack-based internal AI assistants\n📄 AI-powered document summarization with memory\n💬 Actionable recommendations based on real Slack conversations\n📊 Enterprise knowledge augmentation from vector DBs\n\n**Why This Template Stands Out**\n\n1. Combines live Slack interaction, file ingestion, and Pinecone retrieval into a fully RAG-powered response system.\n2. AI prompts are carefully scoped for actionable, context-aware, and time-bound responses.\n3. No-code setup with modular components for scaling or adapting to new use cases (e.g., different roles or goals).\n",
