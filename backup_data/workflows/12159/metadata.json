  "description": "This workflow acts as an automated engagement bot. It sends a Direct Message (DM) with a link or resource to any follower who replies to your post with a specific target keyword.\n\n## Who is this for\nIdeal for creators and community managers who want to distribute resources (PDFs, links, invites) to their audience automatically without manually messaging each person.\n\n## What it does\nIt scans your notifications for new replies and applies a strict filter to ensure only the right people get messaged:\n* **Targeted:** It only monitors replies on the specific post you choose.\n* **Keyword Match:** Checks if the user's reply contains your specific trigger word (e.g., \"Send\").\n* **Follower Check:** Verifies if the user is following you (if not, it skips them).\n* **Delivery:** Opens a chat conversation and sends your pre-set message.\n* **Engagement:** Automatically \"Likes\" the user's reply to confirm receipt.\n* **Anti-Spam:** Remembers processed replies so it never messages the same user twice for the same interaction.\n\n## How to set up\n1. **Configuration:** Open the first node (\"Configuration\") and enter:\n   * **BlueSky Credentials:** Your Handle and App Password.\n   * **Target Post URL:** The full link to the specific BlueSky post you want to monitor.\n   * **Trigger Keyword:** The word users must type (e.g., \"Template\").\n   * **DM Message:** The actual text/link to send them.\n2. **Activate:** Turn the workflow on. It runs every 30 minutes to batch-process new replies.\n\n## 🚀 The BlueSky Growth Suite\nThis workflow is part of a 3-part automation suite designed to help you grow on BlueSky:\n* **Part 1: Post Scheduler** (Manage content from Google Sheets)\n* **Part 2: Analytics Tracker** (Track likes/reposts back to Sheets)\n* **Part 3: Auto-DM Bot** (This template)",
