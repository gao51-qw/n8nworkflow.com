  "description": "## How it works  \nThis workflow checks the health of your web services or APIs on a schedule, prevents false alerts with a second verification, and sends confirmed failure alerts directly to Slack.  \n\n- Performs scheduled HTTP health checks  \n- Waits and retries before confirming failure  \n- Sends alerts only if the service fails twice in a row  \n- Reduces false positives and avoids alert fatigue  \n\n## Setup steps  \n1. Add your service URL(s) in the HTTP Request nodes  \n2. Configure your Slack Bot Token in n8n  \n3. Deploy the workflow  \n4. Get real-time Slack alerts when services go down 🚨  \n\n## Use case  \nPerfect for IT teams, DevOps engineers, and developers who need reliable uptime monitoring without noise.  \n\n![Slack Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuguiDragos/Service-Health-Monitor/refs/heads/main/Slack.png)",
