  "description": "## 🧑‍💻 Description\nThis workflow demonstrates how to take structured data (e.g., Name, Business, Address) and automatically fill a PDF form (IRS W-9) using **PDF.co** inside **n8n**.  \n\nThe workflow extracts values from a data source (e.g., Set node, database, or webhook), maps those values to fields in a PDF template, and generates a completed PDF. This can be adapted for contracts, invoices, HR forms, or any standardized documents that need automation.  \n\nBy chaining additional nodes, you can also **store completed PDFs in Google Drive/Dropbox, email them to recipients, or route them into CRM/ERP systems**.  \n\n**Disclaimer: this template can only be used on self-hosted n8n instances**\n\n\n![image.png](fileId:2207)\n\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Setup Instructions\n\n### 1️⃣ Prepare Your Data\n- Add a **Set** node (or connect to your data source such as Google Sheets, Airtable, or a webhook).  \n- Define fields like:  \n  - `Name`  \n  - `Business`  \n  - `Address`  \n  - `CityState`  \n- These fields will map directly to form fields in the PDF.\n\n### 2️⃣ Connect PDF.co\n1. Create a free account at [PDF.co](https://pdf.co/)  \n2. Copy your **API Key** from the dashboard  \n3. In **n8n → Credentials → New → PDF.co API**  \n   - Paste your API Key → **Save**  \n4. In the **PDF.co node**, select your credential and choose the **Fill a PDF Form** operation  \n5. Map each field in your dataset to the corresponding PDF form field (e.g., `Name` → Line 1 on the W-9).  \n\n---\n\n## 📄 Example Form\nThis template uses the official IRS **W-9 PDF**:  \nhttps://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf  \n\nMapped fields include:  \n- Name → Line 1  \n- Business → Line 2  \n- Address + City/State → Address block  \n\nYou can expand this by mapping additional fields such as **Tax Classification, Exemptions, TIN, and Signature**.  \n\n---\n\n## 🎛️ Customization Guidance\n- **Different PDFs**: Swap the W-9 for any contract, invoice, or onboarding form your business uses.  \n- **Dynamic Data Sources**: Replace the Set node with Google Sheets, Airtable, or API/Webhook inputs to pull live data.  \n- **Automated Delivery**: After filling the form, use Email or Slack nodes to send PDFs directly to recipients.  \n- **Document Storage**: Save completed PDFs automatically to Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3.  \n- **Bulk Processing**: Loop through rows of a dataset (e.g., customer list) to generate multiple personalized PDFs at once.  \n\n---\n\n## 📬 Contact\nNeed help customizing this workflow for contracts, invoices, or HR forms?  \n\n- 📧 **robert@ynteractive.com**  \n- 🔗 **[Robert Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-breen-29429625/)**  \n- 🌐 **[ynteractive.com](https://ynteractive.com)**\n",
