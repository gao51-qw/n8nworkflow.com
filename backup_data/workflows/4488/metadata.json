  "title": "Automate WooCommerce image product background removal using API and Google Sheet",
  "description": "This workflow automates the process of **removing backgrounds from WooCommerce product images** using the BackgroundCut API, and then updates the product images in both **WooCommerce** and a **Google Sheet**.\n\nOnce set up, the workflow processes product images in bulk, removing backgrounds and updating WooCommerce seamlessly.\n\nThis workflow is perfect for online stores that sell:\n* Clothing and fashion items\n* Jewelry and accessories\n* General consumer products\n\nAny product that benefits from clean, background-free images for a professional storefront presentation will see improved visual appeal and potentially higher conversions.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits\n\n* **⏱ Time-saving:** Automates what would otherwise be a manual and repetitive task of editing images and updating product listings.\n* **🔄 Fully Integrated:** Connects Google Sheets, BackgroundCut API, FTP server, and WooCommerce in a seamless loop.\n* **📦 Scalable:** Supports batch processing, making it suitable for stores with hundreds of products.\n* **📁 Organized Tracking:** Updates the Google Sheet with the new image and a “DONE” flag for easy monitoring.\n* **🔧 Customizable:** You can change the image processing API, storage server, or eCommerce platform if needed.\n\n---\n\n\n### **How It Works**  \n1. **Data Retrieval**:  \n   - The workflow starts by fetching product data (ID and IMAGE URL) from a Google Sheets document.  \n   - Only rows without a \"DONE\" marker are processed to avoid duplicates.  \n\n2. **Background Removal**:  \n   - Each product image URL is sent to the **BackgroundCut API**, which removes the background and returns the edited image.  \n\n3. **File Handling**:  \n   - The processed image is uploaded to an **FTP server** with the original filename preserved.  \n   - A new URL for the edited image is generated and assigned to the product.  \n\n4. **WooCommerce Update**:  \n   - The product in WooCommerce is updated with the new image URL.  \n\n5. **Sheet Update**:  \n   - The Google Sheet is marked as \"DONE\" for the processed row, and the new image URL is recorded.  \n\n6. **Batch Processing**:  \n   - The workflow loops through all rows in the sheet until all products are processed.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Set Up Steps**  \n1. **Prepare the Google Sheet**:  \n   - Clone the provided [Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DxiZTvam_4oHHnZVBj_3K3pmWRld8T7l2v_DMuGsqss/edit?usp=sharing).  \n   - Fill in the **ID** (product ID) and **IMAGE** (original image URL) columns.  \n\n2. **API & Credentials Setup**:  \n   - Get an **API key** from [BackgroundCut.co](https://backgroundcut.co).  \n   - Configure the **HTTP Request node** (\"Remove from Image URL\") with:  \n     - **Header Auth**: `Authorization` = `API_KEY`.  \n   - Set up WooCommerce API credentials in the **\"Update product\" node**.  \n\n3. **FTP Configuration**:  \n   - Replace `YOUR_FTP_URL` in the **\"New Image Url\" node** with your FTP/CDN base URL.  \n   - Ensure FTP credentials are correctly set in the **FTP node**.  \n\n4. **Execution**:  \n   - Run the workflow manually via **\"When clicking ‘Execute workflow’\"**.  \n   - The process automatically handles background removal, file upload, and WooCommerce updates.  \n\n\n----\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).
