# AI Client Onboarding Agent: Auto Welcome Email Generator

**Subtitle:** From Form Response to Personalized Welcome Email

---

### 🌍 Overview

This workflow automates the **client onboarding process**.
When a new client fills in the **Google Form**, their data flows into Google Sheets → gets structured → an **AI model (Gemini)** generates a **personalized onboarding email** → and finally, Gmail sends it directly to the client.

Think of it as your **automated client success assistant**.

## 🟢 Section 1: Trigger – Capture New Client

🔗 **Node:** `Google Sheets Trigger`

* Watches for **new rows** added to the “Onboarding” Google Sheet.
* Starts the workflow whenever a new client submits the onboarding form.

💡 **Why useful?**
You never have to check the sheet manually — the workflow kicks off the moment a client signs up.

📩 **Example Input (from form):**

* Name: *Sarah Ali*
* Email: *[sarah@startup.com](mailto:sarah@startup.com)*
* Company: *GreenTech Solutions*
* Services Needed: *Branding + Website*

## 🟦 Section 2: Structure Client Data

🔗 **Nodes:**

* `Client Data` → Formats the raw form submission into a **clean text summary** (Name, Email, Company, Service, Extra Info).
* `Client Checklist` → Prepares a **standard onboarding checklist** with items like:

  1. Account setup
  2. Welcome call scheduled
  3. Document collection
  4. Service configuration
  5. Onboarding session
  6. First milestone review

💡 **Why useful?**
It makes sure the AI has **all key details** + a **clear structure** before writing the email.

## 🟣 Section 3: AI-Generated Email

🔗 **Nodes:**

* `Basic LLM Chain` → Prompted to **write a professional onboarding email body**.
* `Google Gemini Chat Model` → Supports the LLM chain with **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for fast generation.

🧠 **Prompt Logic:**

* Starts with:
  `Hi [Client Name],`
* Includes personalized fields (Name, Company, Services Needed).
* Inserts onboarding checklist steps.
* Ends with:
  `Best regards, Your [Company Name] Team`

💡 **Why useful?**
Instead of a generic welcome, each client gets a **personalized email** that feels human-written.

📩 **Example Output Email:**

## 🟡 Section 4: Send Email

🔗 **Node:** `Gmail`

* Sends the AI-generated email to the client’s email address.
* Subject line:
  `Welcome to Our Service, [Client Name]`

💡 **Why useful?**

## 🔴 Section 5: Error Handling

🔗 **Nodes:**

* `Error Handler` → Listens for any errors during execution.
* `Execution Failure` → Logs failed runs.
* `Execution Completed` → Confirms successful runs.

💡 **Why useful?**
Ensures **nothing gets stuck silently** — you’ll always know if something fails.
