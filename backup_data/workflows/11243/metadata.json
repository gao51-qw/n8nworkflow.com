  "description": "This workflow acts as your personal inbox assistant. It automatically filters, classifies, and responds to incoming emails using AI, saving you from manually sorting through leads or inquiries 24/7.\n\n## 👥 Who’s it for\n* **Freelancers & Consultants** handling their own sales pipeline.\n* **Sales Professionals** who need to book meetings instantly.\n* **Small Business Owners** who want to automate customer support or lead triage.\n* **Agencies** managing inbound inquiries for multiple clients.\n\n## ⚙️ How it works\nThis workflow monitors your Gmail inbox and processes emails in three main stages:\n\n1.  **Filtering:** It first checks if the sender is on your \"Whitelist\" (a Google Sheet). It also ignores automated calendar replies (like \"Accepted\" or \"Declined\" notifications) to prevent loops.\n2.  **AI Analysis:** OpenAI (GPT-4) reads the email body to understand the sender's intent.\n3.  **Action:** Based on the intent, it takes one of three paths:\n    * **Schedule Meeting:** If the lead wants to meet, it creates a Google Calendar event, sends a confirmation email with the link, and notifies you on Telegram.\n    * **Auto Reply:** If the lead declines or isn't interested, it sends a polite, context-aware \"thank you\" email.\n    * **Needs Review:** If the email is unclear, it waits (configurable delay) and sends a gentle follow-up email to re-engage them.\n\n## 📋 Requirements\n* **n8n** (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n* **Gmail Account** (Connected via OAuth2)\n* **Google Sheets** (For the whitelist)\n* **Google Calendar** (For booking meetings)\n* **OpenAI API Key** (GPT-4o-mini or similar model)\n* **Telegram** (Optional, for notifications)\n\n## 🛠️ How to set up\n1.  **Prepare the Whitelist:** Create a Google Sheet with three columns: `email`, `first_name`, and `company`. Add the email addresses you want the bot to respond to.\n2.  **Configure Credentials:** Connect your Google (Gmail, Sheets, Calendar) and OpenAI accounts in the workflow credentials settings.\n3.  **Link the Sheet:** In the **\"Get row(s) in sheet\"** node, select your whitelist spreadsheet.\n4.  **Set the Model:** Check the **\"Message a model\"** nodes to ensure your OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) is selected.\n5.  **Telegram (Optional):** If you want notifications, create a bot with @BotFather and add your Chat ID/Credentials. If not, you can disable/remove the Telegram nodes.\n\n## 🎨 How to customize the workflow\n* **Adjust the Delay:** The **\"Wait\"** node is currently set to *minutes* for testing. Change this to *3 Days* (or your preferred duration) for a real-world scenario.\n* **Brand Your Emails:** Open the **Code** nodes (e.g., \"Personalize AI Reply\"). You will see HTML code inside. Update the `senderName`, `senderEmail`, and footer text to match your brand identity.\n* **Refine AI Prompts:** You can modify the system prompt in the **\"Message a model\"** node to change the AI's tone (e.g., make it more formal or casual).\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 Creator Information\n\n**Developed by:** Adem Tasin  \n🌐 **Website:** [ademtasin.com](https://www.ademtasin.com/)  \n💼 **LinkedIn:** [Adem Tasin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adem-tasin/)",
