## ✅ Setup Instructions

### 🔑 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

* A self-hosted **n8n** instance
* A **Google account** with access to:

  * Gmail
  * Google Sheets
* A **Slack Webhook URL** (optional but included)
* A designated **Google Sheet** to store invoices

---

### 📋 Step 1: Google Sheet Setup

Create a new Google Sheet and add the following columns in the first row (**must match exactly**):

```
Invoice No | Patient Name | Email | Date | Total Cost | Line Items | Payment Status
```

&gt; ✅ **Customizable**: You can add columns like “Insurance Provider” or “Payment Status” if needed—just update the mapping in the Google Sheets node.

---

### 🗂️ Step 2: Configure Google Credentials in n8n

In n8n:

* Go to **Settings → Credentials**
* Add:

  * **Google Sheets OAuth2**
  * **Gmail OAuth2**
* Ensure proper scopes are granted:

  * `.../auth/spreadsheets`
  * `.../auth/gmail.send`

---

### 🧾 Step 3: Configure Treatment Pricing

In the `Calculate prices` code node:

```js
const treatmentPrices = {
  "General Consultation": 60,
  "Blood Test - Basic Panel": 45,
  "Blood Test - Comprehensive": 120,
  "X-Ray - Single": 80,
  "Physical Therapy Session": 75,
  "Vaccination - Standard": 40,
  "Specialist Consultation": 120,
  "Minor Procedure": 150
};
```

&gt; ✏️ **Customizable**: Add, remove, or change treatment names and prices.

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Embed the Patient Billing Form

In the `On form submission` node:

* The form collects:

  * Patient Name
  * Email Address
  * Visit Date
  * Selected Treatments (multi-select dropdown)

&gt; ✏️ **Customizable**: Modify the form fields to include phone number, insurance info, etc.

---

### 📬 Step 5: Customize the Email Template

Open the `Send Patient Invoice Email` node:

Example message:

```
Hi {{ $json.patientName }},

Thank you for visiting MediSure Clinic on {{ $json.formattedDate }}.
Here is a summary of your treatments:
{{ $json.lineItems }}

Total Due: **${{ $json.totalCost }}**

Best regards,  
MediSure Billing Department
```

&gt; ✏️ **Customizable**: Adjust the message, branding, and subject line to match your practice.

---

### 🧠 Step 6: Handle Errors

The `Error Check` and `Generate Error Message` nodes ensure:

* No invoice is sent without an email
* Admins are alerted via Slack if critical info is missing

&gt; ✏️ **Customizable**: Replace Slack with email, webhook, or CRM notification if preferred.

---

### 🧾 Step 7: Log to Google Sheets

The `Log Invoice to Googlesheets` node appends each record:

* Invoice number
* Patient name
* Email
* Date
* Total cost
* Line items

&gt; ✏️ **Customizable**: You can change the target spreadsheet or sheet name.

---

## 🔄 Testing

Once configured:

1. Toggle the workflow **Active**
2. Submit a test form
3. Check:

   * Email receipt is accurate
   * Data is correctly appended in Google Sheets
   * No errors are logged
