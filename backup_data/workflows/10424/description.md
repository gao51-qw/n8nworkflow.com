## How it works
This workflow automatically fetches the latest public grant information from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) RSS feed.  
It uses AI to summarize and structure each grant post into a clear format, stores the results in Google Sheets, and sends a formatted HTML summary via Gmail.

**Workflow summary**
1. Schedule Trigger – Runs the flow daily or weekly.  
2. RSS Feed Reader – Fetches the latest MHLW news and updates.  
3. Text Classifier (AI) – Categorizes the item as “Grant/Subsidy”, “Labor-related”, or “Other”.  
4. AI Agent – Extracts structured data such as title, summary, deadline, amount, target, and URL.  
5. Google Sheets – Appends or updates the database using the grant title as the key.  
6. Code Node – Builds an HTML report summarizing new entries.  
7. Gmail – Sends a daily digest email to your inbox.
