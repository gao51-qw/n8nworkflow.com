This workflow automates the end-to-end process of generating and publishing blog posts from live news headlines.

Fetch Headlines – Collects the latest top stories from Google News and GDELT, merges them, and removes duplicates.

Headline Selection & Classification – Picks top headlines, checks relevance, and applies style rules.

Draft Generation – Uses GPT to create an initial blog article in a natural, human tone.

Tone & Expansion – Refines the draft for clarity, length, and style (customized to your own writing voice).

Image Generation – Sends the article topic to Leonardo AI, waits for the image to finish rendering, and retrieves the final asset.

Publish to WordPress – Uploads the generated image, assigns alt-text, creates a WordPress post with the article and image, and logs the publication to Google Sheets for tracking.
