  "description": "## Description\nWhenever a Zoom “Meeting assets” email arrives in your Gmail inbox, this workflow will:\n\n1) Trigger on new Gmail messages filtered by the subject “Meeting assets”.\n\n2) Extract from the email (HTML or plain text):\n\n3) Type of session (e.g. “1 hour”, “2 hours”, or “exploratory call”).\n\n\t- Client’s full name.\n\t- Session date & time (from the GMT… timestamp).\n\t- Duration (HH:MM:SS).\n\t- Recording link.\n\t- Quick summary.\n\t- Detailed summary.\n\t- List of next steps.\n\n4) Lookup the client in your Master Airtable base, table People, by full name.\n\n5) Send a personalized Gmail to the client with all extracted details.\n\n6) Create a new record in your Sessions table in Airtable, linking back to that client.\n\n## Quick Start\n1. Import this JSON into n8n as a new workflow.\n2. Connect your Gmail credentials (OAuth2).\n3. Connect your Airtable credentials (Personal Access Token).\n4. In the Search Records node:\n5. Base → your Master base ID.\n6. Table → “Your people table”.\n7. Filter By Formula → ={Full Name} = '{{ $json.clientName }}'.\n8. In the Create Record node: Table → “Sessions”.\n9. Map each field (dateTime, duration, summaries, next steps, client link).\n10. Activate the workflow.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\t- n8n v1.50 or higher\n\t- A Gmail account with OAuth2 credentials configured\n\t- An Airtable base containing:\n\t- Table People with a Full Name field (and email).\n\t- Table Sessions with fields: DateTime, Duration, Quick Summary, Detailed Summary, Next Steps, and a Linked Record to People.\n\t- An Airtable Personal Access Token with read/write access to that base.\n\n## Tips & Extensions\n\n- Timezone conversion: Use a Function node with moment-timezone to convert UTC if needed.\n\n- Error handling: Add a catch node to log or notify if any field fails to parse.\n\n- Alternate notifications: Swap the Gmail node for Slack, Microsoft Teams, or SMS integrations.\n\n- With this documentation, your team can import and deploy the workflow in minutes. \n\n## Enjoy!",
