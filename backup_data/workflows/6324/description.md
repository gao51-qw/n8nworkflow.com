## Description
Whenever a Zoom “Meeting assets” email arrives in your Gmail inbox, this workflow will:

1) Trigger on new Gmail messages filtered by the subject “Meeting assets”.

2) Extract from the email (HTML or plain text):

3) Type of session (e.g. “1 hour”, “2 hours”, or “exploratory call”).

	- Client’s full name.
	- Session date & time (from the GMT… timestamp).
	- Duration (HH:MM:SS).
	- Recording link.
	- Quick summary.
	- Detailed summary.
	- List of next steps.

4) Lookup the client in your Master Airtable base, table People, by full name.

5) Send a personalized Gmail to the client with all extracted details.

6) Create a new record in your Sessions table in Airtable, linking back to that client.

## Quick Start
1. Import this JSON into n8n as a new workflow.
2. Connect your Gmail credentials (OAuth2).
3. Connect your Airtable credentials (Personal Access Token).
4. In the Search Records node:
5. Base → your Master base ID.
6. Table → “Your people table”.
7. Filter By Formula → ={Full Name} = '{{ $json.clientName }}'.
8. In the Create Record node: Table → “Sessions”.
9. Map each field (dateTime, duration, summaries, next steps, client link).
10. Activate the workflow.

## Prerequisites
	- n8n v1.50 or higher
	- A Gmail account with OAuth2 credentials configured
	- An Airtable base containing:
	- Table People with a Full Name field (and email).
	- Table Sessions with fields: DateTime, Duration, Quick Summary, Detailed Summary, Next Steps, and a Linked Record to People.
	- An Airtable Personal Access Token with read/write access to that base.

## Tips & Extensions

- Timezone conversion: Use a Function node with moment-timezone to convert UTC if needed.

- Error handling: Add a catch node to log or notify if any field fails to parse.

- Alternate notifications: Swap the Gmail node for Slack, Microsoft Teams, or SMS integrations.

- With this documentation, your team can import and deploy the workflow in minutes. 

## Enjoy!
