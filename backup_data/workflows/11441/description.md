## How it works

This workflow automatically uploads YouTube Shorts from a Google Drive folder.
It picks one video at each run, generates a YouTube-optimized title, description, and hashtags using an AI model, uploads the video through YouTube’s resumable upload API, and finally moves the processed video to a “Posted” folder.

## Key steps

Run on a schedule (daily/hourly/custom CRON)

Fetch one video from a selected Google Drive folder

Generate title + description + hashtags using an LLM

Prepare YouTube metadata

Upload the video via resumable upload

Move the file to a “posted” folder to avoid duplicates
