## Scale Your Creative Strategy: 100+ Creative Ads from 1 Image using Fal.AI, Nano Banana model and GPT-5.1

This workflow turns a single reference image into up to 100 high-performing ad variations using **Fal.AI's Nano Banana** model and **GPT-5.1**. Simply upload your inspiration to a form, and watch as unique, campaign-ready images appear in your Google Drive.

### Why use this?
*   **Scale Instantly:** Turn one idea into a full campaign without manual design work.
*   **Smart Variations:** Uses GPT-5.1 to analyze your reference and rewrite prompts based on proven creative recipes (Metaphors, Pointers, Comparisons).
*   **Cost Effective:** Generates 100 variations for approximately **$4.60** (vs. hundreds of dollars with manual design).

### How does it work?
1.  **You submit the form** with your reference image, company name, and selected "Creative Recipe."
2.  **GPT-5.1 analyzes your image** deeply ("Describe the image extremely comprehensively...").
3.  **It rewrites the prompt** into multiple unique variations based on your chosen strategy (e.g., "The Metaphor Bake").
4.  **Fal.AI generates the images** using the fast and efficient Nano Banana model.
5.  **The results are saved** directly to your Google Drive output folder.

### What do you need?
*   **Google Drive Credentials:** To upload your reference and save the results ([Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/)).
*   **OpenAI API Key:** For GPT-5.1 analysis and prompt engineering.
*   **Fal.AI API Key:** For generating the images (ensure you have credits).
*   **A Google Drive Folder:** One for inputs and one for outputs.

### 💰 Estimated Costs
*   **Fal.AI:** ~$4.00 for 100 images ($0.04/image).
*   **GPT-5.1:** ~$0.60 for 100 descriptions (Input: $1.25/1M tokens, Output: $10.00/1M tokens).
*   **Total:** ~$4.60 per 100-ad campaign.

### Important: The Prompt Strategy
This automation doesn't just copy your image. It uses a specific instruction to **"Describe the image extremely comprehensively. don't leave anything behind"**. This ensures GPT-5.1 captures every visual detail—lighting, composition, and mood—before rewriting it into new creative angles.

That’s it! Just fill the form and let the automation build your ad campaign.
