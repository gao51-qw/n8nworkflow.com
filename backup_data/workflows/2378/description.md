### ⚠️ Important note for cloud users ⚠️
Since the cloud version doesn't support environmental variables, please make the following changes in the CONFIG node:
* Update the `instance_url` variable: Enter your n8n URL instead of `{{$env["N8N_PROTOCOL"]}}://{{$env["N8N_HOST"]}}`
* Change the `webhook_path` to simply "webhook" instead of `{{$env["N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK"] || "webhook"}}`
