  "description": "# Reddit Post Saver & Summarizer with AI-Powered Filtering\n\n## Who This Is For\nPerfect for **content curators, researchers, developers, and community managers** who want to build a structured database of valuable Reddit content without manual data entry. If you're tracking industry trends, gathering user feedback, or building a knowledge base from Reddit discussions, this workflow automates the entire process.\n\n## The Problem It Solves\nReddit has incredible discussions, but manually copying posts, extracting insights, and organizing them into a database is time-consuming. This workflow automatically transforms your saved Reddit posts into structured, searchable data—complete with AI-generated summaries of both the post and its comment section.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. Save Posts Manually\nSimply use Reddit's built-in save feature on any post you find valuable.\n\n### 2. Automated Daily Processing\nThe workflow triggers once per day and:\n- Fetches all your saved Reddit posts via Reddit API\n- Filters posts by subreddit and custom conditions (e.g., \"only posts about JavaScript frameworks\" or \"posts with more than 100 upvotes\")\n- Uses an LLM (Google Gemini) to verify posts match your natural language criteria\n- Generates comprehensive summaries of both the original post and top comments\n\n### 3. Structured Database Storage\nFiltered and summarized posts are automatically saved to your Supabase database with this structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"reddit_id\": \"unique post identifier\",\n  \"title\": \"post title\",\n  \"url\": \"direct link to Reddit post\",\n  \"summary\": \"AI-generated summary of post and comments\",\n  \"tags\": [\"array\", \"of\", \"relevant\", \"tags\"],\n  \"post_date\": \"original post creation date\",\n  \"upvotes\": \"number of upvotes\",\n  \"num_comments\": \"total comment count\"\n}\n```\n\n## Setup Requirements\n- **Reddit API credentials** (client ID and secret)\n- **Supabase account** with a database table\n- **Google Gemini API key** (or alternative LLM provider)\n- Basic configuration of filter conditions (subreddit names and natural language criteria)\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Product Research**: Track competitor mentions and feature requests\n- **Content Creation**: Build a library of trending topics in your niche\n- **Community Management**: Monitor feedback across multiple subreddits\n- **Academic Research**: Collect and analyze discussions on specific topics",
