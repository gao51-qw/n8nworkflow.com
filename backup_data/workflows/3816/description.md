**How it works**  
• Automates multi-platform social media posting (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.) using AI-generated content  
• Integrates Airtable, n8n, and Blotato for full content scheduling and publishing  
• Supports both image and video uploads with dynamic text and account routing

**Set up steps**  
• Takes ~15–30 minutes to set up depending on how many platforms you connect  
• Requires Airtable personal access token and Blotato API key  
• Uses sticky notes throughout the workflow to explain config, tokens, and troubleshooting clearly
