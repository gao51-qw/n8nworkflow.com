  "description": "## How it works:\n\nUsing a Crew of AI agents (Senior Researcher, Visionary, and Senior Editor), this crew will automatically determine the right questions to ask to produce a detailed fundamental stock analysis.\n\nThis application has two components: a front-end and a Stock Q&A engine.  \n\nThe front end is the team of agents automatically figuring out the questions to ask, and the back-end part is the ability to answer those questions with the SEC 10K data.\n\nThis template implements the Stock Q&A engine.\n\nFor the front-end of the application, you can choose one of two options:\n- using CrewAI with the Replit environment (code approach)\n- fully visual approach with n8n template (AI-powered automated stock analysis)\n\n![stockaiexplainerdiagram.png](fileId:783)\n\n## Setup steps:\n1. Use first workflow in template to upsert a company annual report PDF (such as from SEC 10K filling) \n2. Get URL for Webhook in second workflow template\n\n**CrewAI front-end:** [Youtube overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMvizUx5n1g)\n-  Fork this AI Agent environment [Crew Agent Environment](https://replit.com/@DerekCheung9/AI-Automation-For-Finance)\n- Set the webhook URL into N8N_WEBHOOK_URL variable\n- Set OpenAI_API_KEY variable",
