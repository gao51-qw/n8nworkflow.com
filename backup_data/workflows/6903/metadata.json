  "description": "# CPO Agent with Product Team\n\n## Description\nStreamline product development with an AI-powered Chief Product Officer (CPO) agent orchestrating specialized product team members for comprehensive product strategy and execution.\n\n## Overview\nThis n8n workflow creates a comprehensive product development department using AI agents. The CPO agent analyzes product opportunities and delegates tasks to specialized agents for product management, UX design, user research, analytics, documentation, and strategic planning.\n\n## Features\n- Strategic CPO agent using OpenAI O3 for complex product strategy and decision-making\n- Six specialized product agents powered by GPT-4.1-mini for efficient execution\n- Complete product lifecycle coverage from ideation to launch\n- Automated user research and persona development\n- UX/UI design specifications and wireframing\n- Product analytics and KPI tracking\n- Technical documentation and API specifications\n\n## Team Structure\n- **CPO Agent**: Product vision and strategy coordination (O3 model)\n- **Product Manager**: Roadmaps, feature specifications, user stories, planning\n- **UX/UI Designer**: User flows, wireframes, interface design, usability\n- **User Research Specialist**: Research plans, personas, market analysis, insights\n- **Product Analytics Specialist**: Metrics, KPIs, A/B testing, data analysis\n- **Technical Writer**: Product documentation, API docs, user guides\n- **Product Strategy Analyst**: Competitive analysis, market positioning, GTM strategy\n\n## How to Use\n1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance\n2. Configure OpenAI API credentials for all chat models\n3. Deploy the webhook for chat interactions\n4. Send product requests via chat (e.g., \"Design a new mobile app feature for user onboarding\")\n5. The CPO will analyze and delegate to appropriate specialists\n6. Receive comprehensive product deliverables and strategic insights\n\n## Use Cases\n- **Feature Development**: Concept → Research → Design → Specifications → Metrics\n- **Product Launch**: Strategy → Documentation → Analytics → Go-to-market planning\n- **User Experience Optimization**: Research → Personas → User flows → Testing → Iteration\n- **Competitive Analysis**: Market research → Positioning → Differentiation strategies\n- **Product Roadmapping**: Vision → Priorities → Timeline → Resource planning\n- **Documentation Suite**: User guides → API documentation → Technical specifications\n- **Analytics Implementation**: KPI definition → Tracking setup → Performance analysis\n- **Market Research**: Customer interviews → Persona development → Requirements gathering\n\n## Requirements\n- n8n instance with LangChain nodes\n- OpenAI API access (O3 for CPO, GPT-4.1-mini for specialists)\n- Webhook capability for chat interactions\n- Optional: Integration with product management tools (Jira, Figma, etc.)\n\n## Cost Optimization\n- O3 model used only for strategic CPO decisions\n- GPT-4.1-mini provides 90% cost reduction for specialist tasks\n- Parallel processing enables simultaneous agent execution\n- Template library leverages proven product frameworks\n\n## Integration Options\n- Connect to product management tools (Jira, Asana, Linear)\n- Integrate with design platforms (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD)\n- Link to analytics tools (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics)\n- Export to documentation platforms (Notion, Confluence)\n\n## Performance Metrics\n- Feature adoption rates and user engagement\n- Product-market fit indicators\n- User satisfaction and NPS scores\n- Development velocity and cycle times\n- Documentation completeness and clarity\n\n## Contact & Resources\n- **Website**: [nofluff.online](https://www.nofluff.online)\n- **YouTube**: [@YaronBeen](https://www.youtube.com/@YaronBeen/videos)\n- **LinkedIn**: [Yaron Been](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaronbeen/)\n\n## Tags\n#ProductManagement #UXDesign #UserResearch #ProductStrategy #ProductOps #ProductAnalytics #TechnicalWriting #ProductDevelopment #FeatureDesign #ProductAI #n8n #OpenAI #MultiAgentSystem #ProductTech #ProductLeadership #Innovation",
