  "description": "This project presents an intelligent email management system powered by advanced artificial intelligence. It utilizes Google's Gemini 2.0 AI model to automatically categorize incoming emails into queries, project updates, and feedback, and generates context-specific responses in real time.\n\nApproach:\nThe system processes emails promptly, ensuring consistent and timely communication. In addition to crafting automated replies, it streamlines workflow efficiency by sending calendar invitations for meetings without manual intervention.\n\nResults:\nThe Smart Email Auto-Responder enhances email management by marking emails as read, applying appropriate labels, and systematically logging correspondence. This significantly reduces manual workload while improving client engagement and operational productivity.",
