Here's the story: • 2009: Redis launched as open-source (BSD license). • 2018: Redis Labs introduced RSAL for modules like Redis Search, Graph etc. • 2024: Redis switched to a commercial license, as cloud providers copied Redis code without contributing back. • 2025: Redis is open source again with AGPL v3. But why? Big players like AWS, Google, and Oracle backed the Valkey fork—a fully open-source Redis alternative now under the Linux Foundation. Check out Valkey—\",\n  \"10x Faster Typescript COMPILER!!! Still there is an ongoing debate on why Microsoft didn't choose Rust or their own C# for this rewrite. Although, according to the team, Go was a better choice as it provided a similar structure and seamless transition.

My current goal is to support forwarding incoming text messages on Teams to a messenger like Signal. The second will be to give support for the reply mechanism from Signal and sync it to Teams. Coming to the technical stuff, I am thinking of using automation tools like Cypress or Playwright to do this. But it all boils down to the availability of public APIs of both messengers. I will try to document my progress here, as I might fail trying, like a lot of other times 😅 Let's see how it pans out. How would you approach this kind of problem?\",\n    \"Do you know about the require cache in Node.js? Lets say you have a js module that you have imported in a js file using require statement. It is highly possible that after a few iterations to your module code, the changes wont reflect even after you have reloaded the api server/modules. This happens because there is a module cache that happens. You need to invalidate it in order for the new changes to reflect.

Nowadays I have been working on creating a seamless out-of-box experience for the new contributors of Sparrow API Tool. A poor app setup experience or hard-to-understand README file can be a serious dealbreaker for the community. I am emphasizing on the following things to make the setup as smooth as possible: 1) Created and hosted Docker images for various microservices like api-service and auth-service on DockerHub. 2) Created an all-in-one docker-compose file to set up everything from database to queue service in one command. 3) Created a migration script that generates a test user on app start—bypassing auth flow for instant contribution. 4) Documented multiple setup methods (Docker and non-Docker). 5) Pre-filled example .env files with required variables for copy-paste convenience.
