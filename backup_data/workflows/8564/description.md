## 🧾 What this workflow does

This automation transforms a short text idea into a cinematic video by chaining together three powerful AI services: GPT-4.1 for scene creation, Dumpling AI’s FLUX.1 Pro model for visual generation, and KIE API (Veo 3) for cinematic video creation. The system fully automates the journey from raw concept to video output, returning the final video URL.

### 🔧 Setup steps

1. **Start with a text idea**  
   Example: “A lion running through misty mountains at sunrise.”

2. **GPT-4.1 Node:**
   - Expands the idea into two parts:
     - **Cinematic Prompt:** Describes the atmosphere, emotion, and camera movement.
     - **Image Prompt:** A vivid single-frame visual to generate the base image.

3. **Dumpling AI Node (FLUX.1 Pro):**
   - Takes the image prompt and returns a cinematic-style image.
   - You can customize dimensions, steps, seed, and guidance level.

4. **KIE API Node (Veo 3):**
   - Sends both the cinematic prompt and image to the Veo 3 model.
   - The model returns a **video URL** (e.g., 3–6 seconds cinematic footage).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The video URL is returned by the HTTP node.
   - You can connect this to Airtable, Slack, Telegram, or Google Sheets to log the result or share with your team.
