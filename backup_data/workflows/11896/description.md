## 📊 Description
Automate multilingual voice content creation by translating an English script into multiple languages and generating natural-sounding audio files using AI. 🌍🎙️ This workflow receives a script via webhook, translates it into selected target languages using GPT-4, converts each translation into high-quality speech with ElevenLabs, and uploads the resulting MP3 files to Google Drive. It’s ideal for teams producing localized videos, podcasts, courses, or educational content at scale — without manual translation or recording. 🚀✨
