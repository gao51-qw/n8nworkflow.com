How it Works:
You can now use the Slack node to create conditional breakpoints! This example shows the loop stop on 4 (of 10) and then you can hit "continue" in Slack when you are ready. 

*You could extend this with a Form node and inject values you type in on the fly.*

Slack was already the best place to debug log n8n, and now it just got better!
