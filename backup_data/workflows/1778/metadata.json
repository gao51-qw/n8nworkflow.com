  "description": "This workflow checks if the task in Todoist has a specific label and based on that creates a new database page in Notion.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Todoist account and [Todoist credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/todoist/)\n- Notion account and [Notion credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/notion/)\n\n## How it works\n\n1. To start the workflow add a task to Todoist and mark it with a label, e.g. “send-to-n8n”.\n2. Wait a maximum of 30 seconds.\n3. Todoist node identifies the tasks marked as “send-to-n8n”.\n4. Notion node creates a new Notion database page. Notice Notion has a new task now with the same name as in Todoist.",
