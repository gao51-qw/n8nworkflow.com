  "description": "### Who’s it for\n\nThis workflow is perfect for HR teams, recruiters, or hiring managers who collect applicant information via a web form and want to automatically forward both candidate details and attached resumes into a dedicated Telegram channel or group. It streamlines manual email checks, speeding up review and collaboration.\n\n### How it works\n\n1. **On form submission**: A **Form Trigger** node captures all applicant fields (name, age, WhatsApp number, education, desired role, availability date, expected salary, resume file, and additional comments).\n2. **Date & Time**: Formats the “fastest start date” into a human-readable string.\n3. **Edit Fields**: A **Set** node renames and reshapes incoming JSON into clear key/value pairs.\n4. **If Have Resume**: An **If** node routes submissions with an attached resume to one branch (sending both info and document) and submissions without a resume to a simpler info-only branch.\n5. **Merge**: Combines branches so both message types terminate in a single unified flow.\n6. **Send a Resume** & **Send a Info**: Two **Telegram** nodes post Markdown-formatted messages (and the PDF resume when available) to your specified Telegram chat.\n\n### How to set up\n\n1. Install and enable the **n8n-nodes-base.formTrigger** and **n8n-nodes-base.telegram** community nodes (preview).\n2. Copy this JSON into your n8n instance (Workflow → Import from clipboard).\n3. Create environment variables for credentials:\n\n   * `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`\n   * `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`\n4. In each Telegram node, reference these variables instead of hard-coding (`{{$env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}}`, `{{$env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}}`).\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n* n8n version ≥ 0.200.0\n* Community nodes: **Form Trigger**, **Telegram**\n* A Telegram bot with chat permissions\n* A hosted form endpoint or embedded form at path `/mmc-newjob`\n\n### How to customize the workflow\n\n* **Form fields**: Edit the **Form Trigger** node’s `formFields.values` to add or remove fields.\n* **Telegram formatting**: Tweak captions under **Send a Resume** and **Send a Info** to adjust the MarkdownV2 styling.\n* **Conditional logic**: Modify the **If Have Resume** node to branch on other criteria (e.g., education level).\n* **Styling**: Update the `customCss` section in **Form Trigger** to match your brand’s look.\n\n### Good to know\n\n* Community nodes may be in preview; test thoroughly before production.\n* Webhook URLs change when you rename the workflow—revisit your form’s embed or webhook settings after renaming.\n* Consider adding an **Error Trigger** node to capture failures and notify your team.\n",
