  "description": "# 🧠 How It Works\n\nThis **AI Agent** automatically qualifies **property buyer leads** from form submissions and sends them directly to your CRM.\n\n### 🔄 Workflow Steps\n\n1. **Form Submission Trigger**  \n   - When a user submits their details via a property inquiry form, the workflow is activated.\n\n2. **AI Lead Classification**  \n   - The buyer’s input (budget, location, timeline, etc.) is analyzed by **OpenAI**.  \n   - Structured data is extracted, and a **lead score (0–100)** is generated.\n\n3. **Lead Qualification Logic**  \n   - Leads with a **score ≥ 70** are marked as **qualified**.  \n   - Leads with a lower score can be ignored or stored separately for later review.\n\n4. **Follow-Up Actions (for Qualified Leads)**  \n   - An **email notification** is sent to the real estate agent.  \n   - A **record is created in Airtable** to act as a lightweight CRM.\n\n---\n\n# ⚙️ How to Set Up\n\n### 1. Form Setup\n- Replace the default trigger with your preferred source:  \n  - Typeform, Google Forms, Webflow form, etc.  \n- Ensure your form collects the following fields:  \n  - `Name`, `Email`, `Budget`, `Location`, `Timeline`, `Property Type`\n\n### 2. Connect Your Credentials\n- Add your **OpenAI API key** for the LLM node  \n- Connect your **Gmail account** for notifications  \n- Link your **Airtable base & table** to store qualified leads  \n\n### 3. Customize Scoring Logic (Optional)\n- Edit the **Information Extractor** prompt to tweak how scoring is calculated  \n- Example: prioritize budget fit, location, or timeline  \n\n### 4. Test the Workflow\n- Submit a test entry via the form  \n- Confirm:  \n  - You receive the notification email  \n  - A new lead record appears in Airtable  \n\n### 5. Activate & Go Live\n- Turn on the workflow  \n- Start qualifying **real buyer leads in real-time** 🎯  \n\n---\n\n# 🚀 Use Cases\n- Realtors → Filter out unqualified leads automatically  \n- Agencies → Save time by only engaging with high-quality inquiries  \n- Teams → Centralize qualified leads in Airtable for instant collaboration  \n\n---\n",
