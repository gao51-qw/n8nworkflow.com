# 🧠 How It Works

This **AI Agent** automatically qualifies **property buyer leads** from form submissions and sends them directly to your CRM.

### 🔄 Workflow Steps

1. **Form Submission Trigger**  
   - When a user submits their details via a property inquiry form, the workflow is activated.

2. **AI Lead Classification**  
   - The buyer’s input (budget, location, timeline, etc.) is analyzed by **OpenAI**.  
   - Structured data is extracted, and a **lead score (0–100)** is generated.

3. **Lead Qualification Logic**  
   - Leads with a **score ≥ 70** are marked as **qualified**.  
   - Leads with a lower score can be ignored or stored separately for later review.

4. **Follow-Up Actions (for Qualified Leads)**  
   - An **email notification** is sent to the real estate agent.  
   - A **record is created in Airtable** to act as a lightweight CRM.
