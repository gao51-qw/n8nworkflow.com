  "description": "## Purpose\n\nThis workflow synchronizes three entities from Notion to Clockify, allowing tracked time to be linked to client-related projects or tasks.\n\n## Demo & Explanation\n\n[![demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qr0cvtAAMrc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qr0cvtAAMrc)\n\n## How it works\n\n- On every run active Clients, Projects and Tasks are retrieved from both Notion and Clockify before being compared by the Clockify ID, which is again stored in Notion for reference\n- Potential differences are then applied to Clockify\n- If an item has been archived or closed in Notion, it is also marked as archived in Clockify\n- All entities are processed sequentially, since they are related hierarchically to each other\n- By default this workflow runs once per day or when called via webhook (e.g. embedded into a Notion Button)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A set of Notion databases with a specific structure is required to use this workflow\n- You can either start with [this Notion Template](https://steadfast-banjo-d1f.notion.site/1ae82b476c84808e9409c08baf382c45) or adapt your system based on the requirements described in the big yellow sticky note of this workflow template\n\n## Setup\n\n- Clone the workflow and select the belonging credentials\n- Follow the instructions given in the yellow sticky notes\n- Activate the workflow\n\n## Related workflows:\n\n- [Backup Clockify to Github based on monthly reports](https://n8n.io/workflows/3147-backup-clockify-to-github-based-on-monthly-reports/)\n- [Prevent simultaneous workflow executions with Redis](https://n8n.io/workflows/2270-prevent-simultaneous-workflow-executions-with-redis/)\n",
