## Purpose

This workflow synchronizes three entities from Notion to Clockify, allowing tracked time to be linked to client-related projects or tasks.

## Demo & Explanation

## How it works

- On every run active Clients, Projects and Tasks are retrieved from both Notion and Clockify before being compared by the Clockify ID, which is again stored in Notion for reference
- Potential differences are then applied to Clockify
- If an item has been archived or closed in Notion, it is also marked as archived in Clockify
- All entities are processed sequentially, since they are related hierarchically to each other
- By default this workflow runs once per day or when called via webhook (e.g. embedded into a Notion Button)
