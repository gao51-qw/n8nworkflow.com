An intelligent chatbot that assists employees by answering common HR or IT questions, supporting both **text** and **audio messages**. This unique feature ensures employees can conveniently ask questions via voice messages, which are transcribed and processed just like text queries.

### How It Works
1. **Message Capture**: When an employee sends a message to the chatbot in WhatsApp or Telegram (text or audio), the chatbot captures the input.
2. **Audio Transcription**: For audio messages, the chatbot transcribes the content into text using an AI-powered transcription service (e.g., Whisper, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text).
3. **Query Processing**:
   - The transcribed text (or directly entered text) is sent to an AI service (e.g., OpenAI) to generate embeddings.
   - These embeddings are used to search a vector database (e.g., Supabase or Qdrant) containing the company’s internal HR and IT documentation.
   - The most relevant data is retrieved and sent back to the AI service to compose a concise and helpful response.
4. **Response Delivery**: The chatbot sends the final response back to the employee, whether the input was text or audio.
