  "title": "Automate Calendly user onboarding & offboarding with Google Sheets and human approval",
  "description": "This workflow automates the entire **Calendly onboarding and offboarding process** for company users. It relies on form submissions, Google Sheets as a source of truth, AI-generated HR emails, man-in-the-loop approval steps, and direct API interactions with Calendly.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Advantages**\n\n✅ **Full Automation of Routine HR Processes**\n\nThe workflow removes the need for HR to manually add or remove Calendly users. It handles data collection, checks eligibility, interacts with Calendly’s API, and updates records automatically.\n\n✅ **Centralized Data Management**\n\nAll onboarding/offboarding data is stored and maintained in a **Google Sheet**, ensuring a single source of truth for user status and activity tracking.\n\n✅ **Built-in Human Validation (Man-in-the-Loop)**\n\nHR receives automated approval emails and must validate each action before a Calendly account is created or removed.\nThis ensures:\n\n* security\n* accuracy\n* compliance with internal policies\n\n✅ **AI-Generated Professional Communication**\n\nOpenAI generates polished, consistent HTML emails for HR, improving communication quality and reducing manual writing time.\n\n✅ **Clean Separation of Onboarding and Offboarding Paths**\n\nBoth processes are independent but structured similarly, making maintenance easier and ensuring consistent logic.\n\n✅ **Direct Integration with Calendly’s API**\n\nThe workflow automatically:\n\n* creates invitations\n* retrieves organization membership\n* deletes users\n\nThis eliminates manual operations inside Calendly, greatly reducing administrative workload.\n\n✅ **Error Reduction & Traceability**\n\nSince every action is logged in the Google Sheet, HR can easily track:\n\n* when onboarding/offboarding occurred\n* whether approval was given\n* if Calendly access is active\n\n✅ **Improved User Experience**\n\nThe final screens (“Onboarding complete”, “Offboarding complete”, “Not approved”) provide immediate feedback to the requester.\n\n---\n\n\n\nThe workflow contains two parallel automation paths:\n\n\n## **1. Onboarding Workflow**\n\n### **How it works**\n\n1. **User submits the Onboarding Form**\n   The form collects *first name*, *last name*, and *email*.\n\n2. **User is appended to the Google Sheet**\n   A new record is added with date, name, email, and a placeholder for the Calendly status.\n\n3. **AI-generated email is prepared**\n   OpenAI generates a full HTML email notifying HR about the onboarding request.\n\n4. **HR receives an approval request via email**\n   Using Gmail’s “send and wait” feature, HR must approve or reject onboarding.\n\n5. **If approved:**\n\n   * The system calls Calendly’s API to **invite the user to the organization**.\n   * The Google Sheet record is updated (`CALENDLY = on`).\n   * The process ends with a confirmation page.\n\n6. **If rejected:**\n\n   * The workflow ends with a “Not approved” page.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Offboarding Workflow**\n\n### **How it works**\n\n1. **User submits the Offboarding Form**\n   Only the email is required.\n\n2. **The system checks the Google Sheet**\n   It verifies if the email exists and if the user currently has Calendly access.\n\n3. **If the user exists**, the workflow:\n\n   * Uses AI to generate a professional offboarding request email.\n   * Sends an approval prompt to HR.\n\n4. **If HR approves:**\n\n   * The workflow retrieves the user’s Calendly membership via API.\n   * Deletes the user from the Calendly organization.\n   * Updates Google Sheets (`CALENDLY = off`).\n   * Ends with a confirmation page.\n\n5. **If approval is denied:**\n\n   * The workflow ends with a “Not approved” screen.\n\n---\n\nHere's a description of the Calendly Onboarding and Offboarding workflow for n8n:\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis workflow automates user onboarding and offboarding processes for Calendly with human approval steps. The system operates through two parallel streams:\n\n**Onboarding Process:**\n- Users submit their information (first name, last name, email) through an onboarding form\n- Data is automatically recorded in a Google Sheets spreadsheet\n- An AI agent generates a professional HTML email notification for HR\n- The email is sent to HR with a double-approval mechanism requiring manual confirmation\n- If approved, the system automatically adds the user to Calendly organization via API\n- The spreadsheet is updated to mark the user as \"on\" for Calendly access\n- User receives a completion confirmation\n\n**Offboarding Process:**\n- Users submit their email through an offboarding form\n- The system checks Google Sheets to verify the user exists and has Calendly access\n- An AI agent generates an offboarding notification email for HR approval\n- After HR double-approval, the system retrieves the user's Calendly membership via API\n- The user is automatically removed from Calendly organization\n- The spreadsheet is updated to mark Calendly access as \"off\"\n- User receives offboarding completion confirmation\n\n## Set Up Steps\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- Google Sheets spreadsheet with columns: DATE, FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, EMAIL, CALENDLY\n- Calendly organization ID and API access\n- Gmail account for sending approval emails\n- OpenAI API access for email generation\n\n**Configuration Steps:**\n1. **Google Sheets Setup:**\n   - Create a spreadsheet with the required column structure\n   - Configure Google Sheets OAuth credentials in n8n\n   - Update the document ID in all Google Sheets nodes\n\n2. **Calendly API Configuration:**\n   - Replace \"XXX\" placeholders in HTTP Request nodes with actual Calendly API bearer tokens\n   - Set the correct Calendly organization ID in the Set nodes\n   - Verify API endpoints match your Calendly organization structure\n\n3. **Email System Setup:**\n   - Configure Gmail OAuth credentials for sending approval emails\n   - Update recipient email address from \"info@n3w.it\" to your HR department's email\n   - Adjust approval timeout settings as needed (currently 45 minutes)\n\n4. **Form Configuration:**\n   - Deploy both onboarding and offboarding forms\n   - Test form submissions to ensure data flows correctly\n   - Customize completion messages for both success and rejection scenarios\n\n5. **AI Email Generation:**\n   - Verify OpenAI API credentials are properly configured\n   - Test email template generation for both onboarding and offboarding scenarios\n   - Adjust system prompts if different email formatting is required\n\n6. **Workflow Activation:**\n   - Test both onboarding and offboarding flows end-to-end\n   - Verify approval emails are received and functional\n   - Confirm Google Sheets updates correctly\n   - Activate the workflow once testing is complete\n\n\n---\n\n### **Need help customizing?**  \n[Contact me](mailto:info@n3w.it) for consulting and support or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davideboizza/).",
