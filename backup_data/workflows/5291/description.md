This n8n automation lets you build a complete AI-powered task management system that integrates **Telegram**, **Google Sheets**, and **GPT-4o mini** to help users easily manage to-do lists and receive daily task reminders.

Users can interact with the system via **Telegram**, while the AI assistant (powered by GPT-4o mini) processes commands naturally, updates a central **Google Sheet**, and ensures scheduled reminders are sent for pending tasks.
