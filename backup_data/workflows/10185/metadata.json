  "description": "## 🧠 How it works  \nThis workflow automatically translates messages between **Japanese** and **English** inside Slack — perfect for mixed-language teams.  \nIn our real-world use case, our 8-person team includes **Arif**, an English-speaking teammate from Indonesia, while the rest mainly speak Japanese.  \n\nBefore using this workflow, our daily chat often included:  \n- “Can someone translate this for Arif?”  \n- “I don’t understand what Arif wrote — can someone summarize it in Japanese?”  \n- “I need to post this announcement in both languages, but I don’t know the English phrasing.”  \n\nThis workflow fixes that communication gap **without forcing anyone to change how they talk**.  \nBuilt with **n8n** and **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**, it automatically detects the input language, translates to the opposite one, and posts the result **in the same thread**, keeping every channel clear and contextual.\n\n\n## ⚙️ Features  \n- Unified translation system with **three Slack triggers**:  \n  1️⃣ **Slash Command `/trans`** – bilingual posts for announcements.  \n  2️⃣ **Mention Trigger `@trans`** – real-time thread translation for team discussions.  \n  3️⃣ **Reaction 🇯🇵 / 🇺🇸** – personal translation view for readers.  \n- Automatic JA ↔ EN detection and translation via **Gemini 2.5 Flash**  \n- 3-second instant **ACK** to satisfy Slack’s response timeout  \n- Shared **Gemini translation core** across all three modes  \n- Clean thread replies using `chat.postMessage`  \n\n\n## 💼 Use Cases  \n- **Global teams** – Keep Japanese and English speakers in sync without switching tools.  \n- **Project coordination** – Use mentions for mixed-language stand-ups and updates.  \n- **Announcements** – Auto-generate bilingual company posts with `/trans`.  \n- **Cross-cultural communication** – Help one-language teammates follow along instantly.  \n\n\n## 💡 Perfect for  \n- **Global companies** with bilingual or multilingual teams  \n- **Startups** collaborating across Japan and Southeast Asia  \n- **Developers** exploring Slack + Gemini + n8n automation patterns  \n\n\n## 🧩 Notes  \n- You can **force a specific translation direction** (JA→EN or EN→JA) inside the *Code* node.  \n- Adjust the system prompt to match tone (“business-polite”, “casual”, etc.).  \n- Add glossary replacements for consistent terminology.  \n- If the bot doesn’t respond, ensure your app includes the following scopes:  \n  `app_mentions:read`, `chat:write`, `reactions:read`, `channels:history`, and `groups:history`.  \n- Always export your workflow with **credentials OFF** before sharing or publishing.  \n\n\n### ✨ Powered by  \n**Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** × **n8n** × **Slack API**  \nA complete multilingual layer for your workspace — all in one workflow. 🌍\n",
