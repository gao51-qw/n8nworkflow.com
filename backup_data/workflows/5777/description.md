## 📊 Example Interaction
**User Input**: "Generate a beautiful image of a dragon from game of thrones"
**Enhanced Prompt**: "A majestic, formidable dragon, reminiscent of those from Game of Thrones, perched atop a jagged, snow-capped mountain peak. The dragon is depicted with immense, leathery wings unfurled, scales glinting with iridescent blues and deep charcoals under the harsh, cold light. Its eyes glow with an inner, fiery amber. The scene is captured with a dramatic, low-angle wide shot, emphasizing the dragon's sheer scale against a turbulent, stormy sky filled with dark, bruised clouds and streaks of lightning. The atmosphere is oppressive and foreboding, with biting wind and swirling snow creating a sense of raw power and danger. The color palette is dominated by icy blues, stark greys, deep blacks, and the contrasting fiery glow of the dragon's eyes and perhaps a hint of internal fire. Rendered in a hyperrealistic, cinematic digital art style, with exceptional attention to detail on the scales, musculature, and the texture of the rocky environment. Lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, with sharp highlights on the dragon's form and deep, impenetrable shadows. Quality specifications include ultra-high detail, 8K resolution, photorealistic rendering, and an epic, awe-inspiring mood, evoking the grandeur and terror of powerful fantasy creatures."
