  "description": "# WooCommerce Product Reviews: Sentiment Analysis with Slack Summary\n\nThis workflow automatically fetches product reviews from your WooCommerce store, analyzes the sentiment of each review using AI, stores the results in Airtable and sends a summary of positive, neutral and negative reviews to Slack. It helps teams quickly understand overall customer feedback, track product sentiment and stay updated without manually reading all reviews.\n\n### Quick Start – Implementation Steps\n\n1.  Import the workflow JSON file into n8n.\n2.  Configure credentials:\n    *   WooCommerce HTTP Basic Auth (for fetching reviews)\n    *   OpenAI API (for sentiment analysis)\n    *   Airtable Personal Access Token (for storing reviews)\n    *   Slack API (for sending summary messages)\n3.  Adjust the Cron/Schedule Trigger node to your preferred interval (e.g., every 10 minutes).\n4.  Test the workflow with a few reviews to ensure AI and Slack integrations work correctly.\n5.  Activate the workflow after confirming functionality.\n    \n\n## What It Does\n\nThis workflow automates sentiment analysis and team notification:\n\n*   **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at defined intervals.\n*   **Set WooCommerce Domain** – Defines the WooCommerce store to fetch reviews from.\n*   **Fetch Reviews** – Retrieves all recent product reviews using WooCommerce API credentials.\n*   **Loop Over Items** – Processes reviews in smaller batches for efficiency.\n*   **Message a Model** – Sends each review to OpenAI to detect sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and generate a short summary.\n*   **Merge & Code Nodes** – Combines original review data with AI results and ensures proper data alignment.\n*   **If Node** – Checks sentiment for further processing.\n*   **Create a Record (Airtable)** – Stores each review and its sentiment in Airtable.\n*   **Code Summary Node** – Counts positive, neutral, and negative reviews to create a summary.\n*   **Send a Message (Slack)** – Posts the sentiment summary to the team’s Slack channel for visibility.\n    \n\n## Who’s It For\n\nThis workflow is ideal for:\n\n*   E-commerce managers tracking WooCommerce product feedback\n*   Customer support teams monitoring review sentiment\n*   Marketing and product teams seeking automated insights\n*   Teams using Airtable and Slack for data tracking and collaboration\n    \n\n## Requirements to Use This Workflow\n\n*   An **n8n instance** (cloud or self-hosted)\n*   **WooCommerce store** with API access\n*   **OpenAI API key** for sentiment analysis\n*   **Airtable account** with base/table configured\n*   **Slack workspace** with API access for messaging\n*   Basic familiarity with APIs and workflow automation\n    \n\n## How It Works\n\n1.  **Schedule Trigger** – Executes the workflow at the defined interval.\n2.  **Set WooCommerce Domain** – Configures which store to fetch reviews from.\n3.  **Fetch Reviews** – Retrieves all recent product reviews from WooCommerce.\n4.  **Loop Over Items** – Splits reviews into manageable batches.\n5.  **Message a Model** – Sends reviews to AI for sentiment analysis and short summary.\n6.  **Merge & Code Nodes** – Combines AI results with original review data and prepares it for storage and summary.\n7.  **If Node** – Checks review sentiment for saving or further processing.\n8.  **Create a Record (Airtable)** – Saves each review with sentiment and AI summary.\n9.  **Code Summary Node** – Counts the number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.\n10.  **Send a Message (Slack)** – Sends a concise summary of review sentiment to the Slack channel.\n    \n\n## Setup Steps\n\n1.  Import the workflow JSON into n8n.\n2.  Add credentials:\n    *   WooCommerce HTTP Basic Auth\n    *   OpenAI API\n    *   Airtable Personal Access Token\n    *   Slack API\n3.  Configure the WooCommerce domain in the Set WooCommerce Domain node.\n4.  Test the workflow with sample reviews to ensure AI outputs correctly.\n5.  Adjust the Schedule Trigger interval as needed.\n6.  Activate the workflow after confirming that data flows correctly from WooCommerce → AI → Airtable → Slack.\n    \n\n## How To Customize Nodes\n\n### Schedule Trigger\n\n*   Adjust interval (minutes, hours, days) as needed.\n    \n\n### Set WooCommerce Domain\n\n*   Replace with your store domain URL.\n    \n\n### Fetch Reviews\n\n*   Update endpoint or filters if needed.\n*   Ensure WooCommerce credentials are correct.\n    \n\n### Message a Model\n\n*   Change AI model or prompts to adjust sentiment analysis or summary style.\n    \n\n### Create a Record (Airtable)\n\n*   Map additional fields if needed.\n*   Ensure the table has the necessary columns for sentiment, summary, rating, and product info.\n    \n\n### Send a Message (Slack)\n\n*   Customize Slack message format.\n*   Change the channel ID to send summaries to the right team.\n    \n\n## Optional Enhancements\n\n*   Include historical review trends.\n*   Automatically trigger notifications only for negative reviews.\n*   Send summaries to email or other messaging apps.\n*   Visualize sentiment trends in Airtable or external dashboards.\n    \n\n## Use Case Examples\n\n1.  **Automated Sentiment Tracking** – Understand customer feedback without manual reading.\n2.  **Team Alerts** – Notify product and support teams about negative reviews quickly.\n3.  **Data Storage & Reporting** – Keep historical sentiment in Airtable for trend analysis.\n4.  **Efficient Batch Processing** – Process large number of reviews without overloading the system.\n    \n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n| Issue                    | Possible Cause                                   | Solution                                                     |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reviews not fetched      | Wrong WooCommerce credentials or endpoint        | Check WooCommerce HTTP Basic Auth and store domain            |\n| AI analysis fails        | OpenAI API key invalid or prompt error           | Verify OpenAI credentials and prompt syntax                  |\n| Slack message missing    | Incorrect Slack channel or API token             | Check Slack credentials and channel ID                       |\n| Airtable not storing reviews | Table or field mismatch                     | Verify Airtable base, table, and column mapping              |\n\n\n## Need Help?\n\nIf you need assistance setting up the workflow, customizing AI sentiment analysis or integrating Slack summaries, feel free to contact our [n8n development team](https://www.weblineindia.com/hire-n8n-developers/) at WeblineIndia.
