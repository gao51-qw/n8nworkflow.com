# 📧 Auto-Send AI Follow-Up Emails to Zoom Attendees

This workflow automatically emails personalized follow-ups to every Zoom meeting participant once the meeting ends.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Zoom Webhook** → Captures meeting.ended event + participant list.  
2. **Normalize Data** → Extracts names, emails, and transcript (if available).  
3. **AI (GPT-4)** → Drafts short, professional follow-up emails.  
4. **Gmail** → Sends thank-you + recap email to each participant.
