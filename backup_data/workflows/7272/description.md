# Monitor Competitor Facebook Ads with Airtop

## Use Case

Monitor a competitor’s active Facebook ads and get a weekly HTML intelligence brief by email — saving time on manual research and helping you spot messaging, offers, and creative trends quickly.

## What This Automation Does

* Runs weekly on a set schedule.
* Uses **Airtop** to visit the competitor’s Facebook Ad Library page and extract up to 30 active ads.
* Summarizes each ad with key points: message, topic, CTA, duration active, language, target audience.
* Sends the compiled HTML report via Gmail.

## How It Works

1. **Schedule Trigger** – Fires once a week at the configured time.
2. **Airtop Extraction** – Loads the Ad Library URL and runs a prompt to extract and format the ads into HTML.
3. **Email Delivery** – Sends the HTML report to your specified recipient using Gmail.

## Setup Requirements

1. **Airtop API Key** — [Generate here](https://portal.airtop.ai/api-keys).
2. **Airtop Credential in n8n** — Add your API key under “Airtop” in n8n.
3. **Gmail OAuth2 Credential** — Connect the Gmail account to send reports.
4. **Competitor’s Ad Library URL** — Replace the default `view_all_page_id` in the workflow with your target.

## Next Steps

* Duplicate the Airtop step for multiple competitors.
* Enrich reports by visiting ad landing pages for deeper analysis.
* Send outputs to Slack or archive in a shared workspace.
