## How it works  
This workflow runs on a daily schedule to analyze all active HubSpot deals and their latest engagement activity. It applies AI-driven behavioral scoring to predict conversion probability and deal health. High-risk or stalled deals automatically trigger Slack alerts. All insights are logged in Google Sheets for forecasting and performance tracking.

## Step-by-step  

- **Step 1 – Trigger and collect active deals**  
  - **Schedule Trigger** – Runs the workflow automatically at a fixed time each day.  
  - **Get Active Deals from HubSpot** – Retrieves all non-closed deals with key properties like value, stage, and activity dates.  
  - **Formatting Data** – Cleans and normalizes deal data while calculating metrics such as deal age and inactivity duration.  

- **Step 2 – Enrich deals with engagement data**  
  - **If** – Filters only active deals to ensure closed deals are excluded.  
  - **Loop Over Items** – Processes each deal individually to handle enrichment safely.  
  - **HTTP Request** – Fetches engagement associations linked to each deal.  
  - **Get an engagement** – Retrieves detailed engagement records from HubSpot.  
  - **Extracts Data** – Structures engagement content, timestamps, and internal notes for AI analysis.  

- **Step 3 – Analyze risk and notify the team**  
  - **AI Agent** – Analyzes behavioral signals and predicts conversion probability, risk level, and next actions.  
  - **Format Data** – Parses the AI output into structured fields and risk indicators.  
  - **Filter Alerts Needed** – Identifies deals that require immediate attention.  
  - **Send Slack Alert** – Sends a detailed alert with risks, signals, and recommended actions.  
  - **Append or update row in sheet** – Stores analysis results in Google Sheets for tracking and forecasting.
