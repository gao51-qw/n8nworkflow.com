# 💰 Auto-Send PDF Invoice When Stripe Payment is Received

This workflow automatically generates a **PDF invoice** every time a successful payment is received in **Stripe**, then emails the invoice to the customer via **Gmail**. Perfect for freelancers, SaaS businesses, and service providers who want to automate billing without manual effort.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Stripe Payment Webhook**  
   - Listens for successful payment events (`payment_intent.succeeded`).  
   - Triggers the workflow whenever a new payment is made.

2. **Normalize Payment Data**  
   - A **Code node** extracts and formats details like:  
     - Payment ID  
     - Amount & currency  
     - Customer name & email  
     - Payment date  
     - Description  
   - Generates a unique invoice number.

3. **Generate Invoice HTML**  
   - A **Code node** builds a professional **invoice template** in HTML.  
   - Data is dynamically inserted (amount, customer info, invoice number).  
   - Output prepared for PDF generation.

4. **Send Invoice Email**  
   - The **Gmail node** sends an email to the customer.  
   - Invoice is attached as a PDF file.  
   - Includes a confirmation message with payment details.
