## How it works
- This workflow calls the Umami API to get data 
- Then it sends the data to A.I. for analysis
- It saves the data and analysis to Baserow

## How to use this
- Input your Umami credentials
- Input your website property ID
- Input your Openrouter.ai credentials
- Input your baserow credentials
- You will need to create a baserow database with columns: Date, Summary, Top Pages, Blog (name of your blog).

## Future development
- Use this as a template. There's alot more Umami stats you can pull from the API.
- Change the A.I. prompt to give even more detailed analysis.
