  "description": "📝 Description\nThis workflow helps automatically classify incoming emails using a combination of conditional logic and minimal AI-based classification. The system checks email content, performs sentiment analysis, uses OpenAI for categorization, and routes emails accordingly — with smart but efficient use of LLMs and AI Agents.\n\n⚙️ How it works\nTrigger: An IMAP Email Trigger initiates the workflow upon receiving a new email.\n\nCode Block: Parses essential data from the email.\n\nSwitch Node: Routes emails based on classification.\n\nLLM Chain: Processes specific email cases (e.g., inquiries or complaints).\n\nAI Agent (Minimal): Used only when other methods cannot determine intent.\n\nEmail Responses: Sends tailored replies or routes to support/sales teams accordingly.\n\nSentiment Analysis: Assists with tone evaluation for better response routing.\n\n🧩 Set up steps\nEstimated setup time: 10–15 minutes\n\nYou’ll need:\n\nAn IMAP-compatible email account\n\nOpenAI or any compatible LLM provider\n\nPinecone (optional, for vector memory)\n\nSMTP credentials for sending email\n\nReplace placeholder credentials in sticky notes before running.",
