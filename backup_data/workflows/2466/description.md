This n8n template demonstrates the beginnings of building your own n8n-powered WhatsApp chatbot! Under the hood, utilise n8n's powerful AI features to handle different message types and use an AI agent to respond to the user. A powerful tool for any use-case!

## How it works
* Incoming WhatsApp Trigger provides a way to get messages into the workflow.
* The message received is extracted and sent through 1 of 4 branches for processing.
* Each processing branch uses AI to analyse, summarize or transcribe the message so that the AI agent can understand it. The supported types are **text**, **image**, **audio (voice notes)** and **video**.
* The AI Agent is used to generate a response generally and uses a wikipedia tool for more complex queries.
* Finally, the response message is sent back to the WhatsApp user using the WhatsApp node.

## How to use
Once you have setup and configured your WhatsApp account, you'll need to activate your workflow to start processing messages.

**Good to know:** Large media files may negatively impact workflow performance.

## Requirements
* WhatsApp Buisness account
* Google Gemini for LLM. Gemini is used specifically because it can accept audio and video files whereas at time of writing, many other providers like OpenAI's GPT, do not.

## Customising this workflow
* For performance reasons, consider detecting large audio and video before sending to the LLM. Pre-processing such files may allow your agent to perform better.
* Go beyond and create rich and engagement customer experiences by responding using images, audio and video instead of just text!
