## Who's it for

Small online store owners, new entrepreneurs, and anyone getting started with e-commerce automation. Perfect for beginners who want to automate their order process without complexity or additional costs. Ideal for stores using Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy, or any platform that supports webhooks.

## How it works

This simple workflow automatically handles new orders by sending professional confirmation emails to customers and notification emails to your team. When a customer places an order, your e-commerce platform sends the order data to this workflow via webhook.

The system extracts essential order information like customer details, order number, and total amount, then validates the data to ensure completeness. It sends a beautifully formatted confirmation email to the customer with order details, next steps, and your contact information. Simultaneously, your team receives an order notification email with all the details needed to process and fulfill the order.

The workflow includes error handling for incomplete orders and sends appropriate responses back to your e-commerce platform to confirm successful processing. Everything is logged for easy tracking and troubleshooting.
