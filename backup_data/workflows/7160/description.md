### Overview  

- This workflow acts as an AI-powered research assistant that takes a topic from the user, performs multi-step intelligent research, and stores the final report in Notion. It uses advanced search, content extraction, and AI summarization to deliver a high-quality research report—fully automated from query to publication.

---

### How It Works  
- **User Interaction**  
  - The workflow starts by asking the user what topic they want to research.  
  - A “Strategy Agent” asks 2–3 clarifying questions to refine the scope.  
  - Once the user confirms, it creates a **Notion database page** with the research title.

- **Search Query Generation**  
  - Generates up to **3 relevant search queries** for the given topic.

- **Data Gathering** (Loop over each query)  
  - Sends the query to **Tavily Search API** to find the most relevant blogs/articles.  
  - Picks the top-matched link and uses Tavily again to extract its content.  
  - Repeats the process for all 3 queries.

- **Report Compilation**  
  - Aggregates extracted content from all sources.  
  - A **Final Report Agent** creates a well-structured research report in **Markdown**.  
  - Converts Markdown → HTML → splits into chunks.  
  - Pushes each chunk into the Notion report page.  

- **Delivery**  
  - Sends the **final Notion report link** back to the user.

### How to Use  
- This workflow is triggered via **Webhook**.  
- **Attach the provided webhook URL** to any application, form, or chatbot to collect the user’s topic.  
- Once triggered, the workflow will run automatically and deliver the research link without any manual steps.
