# Automated weekly security audit reports with Gmail delivery

> # 🔒 N8N Security Audit Report - Automated Weekly Email

## 🎯 What does this workflow do?

This workflow automatically generates and emails a comprehensive security audit report for your N8N instance every week. It identifies potential security risks related to:

- **Credentials** 🔑 : Exposed or insecure credentials
- **Nodes** 🧩 : Sensitive nodes (Code, HTTP Request, SSH, FTP, etc.)
- **Instance settings** 🏢 : Global security configuration
- **Community nodes** 📦 : Third-party nodes that may pose risks

The report includes direct links to affected workflows, execution statuses, and actionable recommendations.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Empty report?**  
→ Check your N8N API key has audit permissions
