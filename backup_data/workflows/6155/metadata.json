  "description": "## 📄 What this workflow does\n\nThis workflow helps you analyze Google reviews of any business to generate powerful marketing insights. By simply submitting a business name and its Google Place ID, it fetches the top 30 reviews and uses GPT-4 (via LangChain Agent) to extract valuable customer insights such as marketing angles, customer motivations, product pain points, and voice of customer (VOC) quotes. The output is stored automatically in a connected Google Sheet.\n\n---\n\n## 👤 Who is this for\n\n- Marketing teams looking for messaging inspiration  \n- Founders or product managers exploring customer feedback  \n- Brand strategists gathering real-world insights  \n- Agencies running VOC or sentiment analysis\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements\n\n- **Dumpling AI API key**  \n- **OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-4o access**  \n- **Google Sheets connection**  \n- A form or manual input with:\n  - Business Name  \n  - Google Place ID\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How to set up\n\n1. **Connect Credentials**  \n   - Dumpling AI (via HTTP Header Auth)  \n   - OpenAI (GPT-4)  \n   - Google Sheets (OAuth2)\n\n2. **Prepare your Google Sheet**  \n   - Create columns:  \n     `Business Name`, `Place ID`, `Marketing Angles`, `Customer Motivations`,  \n     `Frictions and Barriers`, `Product Opportunities`, `VOC Snippets`\n\n3. **Update Nodes**  \n   - Replace the Google Sheets `Document ID` and `Tab Name` with yours  \n   - Check that the Dumpling API node is linked to your credential  \n   - Optional: tweak the prompt in the LangChain Agent node to fit your tone or goals\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 How it works (Workflow Steps)\n\n1.
