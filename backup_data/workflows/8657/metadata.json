  "description": "This workflow helps HR teams run smoother **monthly Q\\&A sessions** with employees.\n\n* **Who’s it for**\n  HR teams and managers who want to centralize employee questions, avoid duplicates, and keep meetings focused.\n\n* **How it works**\n\n1. Employees submit questions through a styled form.\n2. Questions are stored in a database.\n3. HR selects a date range to review collected questions.\n4. An AI Agent deduplicates and clusters similar questions, then generates a **meeting script** in Markdown format.\n5. The Agent automatically creates a **Google Calendar event** (with a Google Meet link) on the **last Friday of the current month at 16:00–17:00**.\n6. The script is returned as a downloadable `.txt` file for HR to guide the session.\n\n* **Requirements**\n\n  * MySQL (or compatible DB) for storing questions\n  * Google Calendar credentials\n  * OpenAI (or another supported LLM provider)\n\n* **How to customize**\n\n  * Adjust meeting day/time in the `Set` node expressions\n  * Change database/table name in MySQL nodes\n  * Modify clustering logic in the AI Agent prompt\n  * Replace the form styling with your company’s branding\n\nThis template ensures **no repeated questions**, keeps HR **better prepared with a structured script**, and **automates meeting scheduling** in just one click.\n",
