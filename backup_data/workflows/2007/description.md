This is a workflow for a Telegram-echo bot.
This bot is useful for debugging and learning purposes of the Telegram platform.
1. Add your Telegram bot credentials for both nodes.
2. Activate the workflow.
3. Send data to the bot (i.e. a message, a forwarded message, sticker, emoji, voice, file, an image...).
4. Second node will fetch the incoming JSON object, format it and send back.
