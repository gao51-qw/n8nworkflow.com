## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case  
Creating **viral short-form videos** is often time-consuming:

6. **Saves metadata in Google Sheets** for tracking and management.  
7. **Auto-uploads the video to all major platforms via Blotato** (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, X/Twitter, Bluesky, Facebook).
