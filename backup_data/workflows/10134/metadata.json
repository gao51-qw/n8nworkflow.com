  "description": "# This free n8n automation helps anyone—from busy parents to entrepreneurs—get a daily SMS summary of their calendar events. It’s a personal assistant that gives you a heads up of what your day will look like.\n\nGreat for: starting your day cognizant of the day's events, or for the neurodivergent.\n\n### Example use case:\nParent receives a text summarizing the Family Calendar events at 5AM. Its a reminder of a child's doctor appointment at 1PM and soccer practice at 430PM. The AI then ends the message on an uplifting note.\n\n### Good to Know\n- Requires user to buy a Twilio phone number to send SMS from. Each message, at the time of writing, is $0.083 CAD. \n- Requires basic knowledge of Google Cloud Console for the activation of Google Calendar API\n\n## How it Works\n1.  Every morning at 7AM, your workflow checks Google Calendar for the day’s events.\n2. It formats your schedule into a friendly, easy-to-read summary using your favorite AI model (any LLM works—Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc).\n3. That summary is texted directly to your phone via Twilio as a personal daily reminder.\n\n## How to Use\n- Copy this n8n workflow into your own instance.\n- Hook up your Google Calendar and Twilio accounts. You can choose the specific calendar in the Calendar node.\n- Choose or swap in any AI model you prefer to personalize your summaries. I find Claude sounds the most natural.\n\n#### Enjoy your daily, cheerful calendar digest by SMS at 7AM!\n\n## Requirements\n- A Google Cloud account (to activate the Calendar API and get credentials—see Google documentation).\n- Twilio account (for sending SMS—get started with Twilio’s easy setup).\n- Any LLM API account (optional, but recommended for polite/friendly summaries).\n\n## Customize this flow\n- Change SMS times to fit your morning routine.\n- Adjust message formatting for your style or brand.\n- Swap LLM services, tweak prompts, or combine multiple calendars—whatever works for you.\n\nReach out anytime at ralleyreminders.com if you have questions or want to share ideas!\n",
