### Who is this for?

This workflow is for social media agencies, influencer marketers, and brand managers who need to automatically qualify TikTok creators based on their follower metrics. It’s especially useful for teams managing influencer outreach campaigns or building talent databases.

### What problem is this workflow solving?

Manually tracking TikTok user stats is time-consuming and inconsistent. This automation instantly pulls TikTok profile data and only saves creators who meet a defined follower threshold. It removes manual vetting, reduces spreadsheet work, and makes influencer qualification scalable.

### What this workflow does

This workflow uses **Airtable** as the trigger, **Dumpling AI** to scrape TikTok profile information, and a logic condition to check if the profile has more than **100k followers**. Qualified profiles are updated with full metrics and stored back in Airtable.

---

### Setup

1. **Airtable Setup**
   - Create a table with a field named `Tik tok username`
   - Connect your Airtable account to n8n using a Personal Access Token
   - Set up a trigger to run when a new TikTok username is added

2. **Dumpling AI**
   - Sign up at [Dumpling AI](https://dumplingai.com)
   - Create a Dumpling AI credential in n8n using your API key
   - The HTTP node sends the TikTok handle to Dumpling’s `/get-tiktok-profile` endpoint

3. **Configure Filter**
   - The IF node checks if `followerCount` is greater than or equal to 100000

4. **Airtable Update**
   - If qualified, the record is updated with:
     - `ID` (TikTok ID)
     - `followerCount`
     - `followingCount`
     - `heartCount`
     - `videoCount`
