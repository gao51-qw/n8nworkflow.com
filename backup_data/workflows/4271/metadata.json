  "description": "## AI evaluation in n8n\n\nThis is a template for n8n's [evaluation feature](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/overview). \n\nEvaluation is a technique for getting confidence that your AI workflow performs reliably, by running a test dataset containing different inputs through the workflow.\n\nBy calculating a metric (score) for each input, you can see where the workflow is performing well and where it isn't.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis template shows how to calculate a workflow evaluation metric: **whether an output matches an expected output** (i.e. has the same meaning).\n\nThe workflow takes questions about the causes of historical events and compares them with the reference answers in the dataset.\n\n- We use an evaluation trigger to read in our dataset \n- It is wired up in parallel with the regular chat trigger so that the workflow can be started from either one. [More info](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/evaluations/tips-and-common-issues/#combining-multiple-triggers)\n- If we're evaluating (i.e. the execution started from the evaluation trigger), we calculate the correctness metric using AI\n- We pass this information back to n8n as a metric\n- If we're not evaluating we avoid calculating the metric, to reduce cost \n\n\n",
