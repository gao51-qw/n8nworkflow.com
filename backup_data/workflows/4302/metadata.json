  "title": "Airtable base backups to S3",
  "description": "This workflow exports every table in a base as its own CSV, saves the files in a time-stamped folder in Amazon S3, pings you on Slack, and optionally prunes older copies. You get an automated weekly backup that is easy to inspect or re-import as needed. You can easily swap the S3 node for the storage provider of your choice.\n\n++How it works++\n\nWeekly Backup\n- Schedule trigger fires weekly\n- Sets and formats the week ex. [2025-W12]\n- Create a folder in S3 bucket with the week\n- Loops through all tables in Airtable base creating CSVs and uploading to the new path\n- Slack message is sent on completion\n\nMonthly Prune\n- Schedule trigger fires weekly\n- Sets a cut-off date 4 weeks in the past\n- Lists folders in S3\n- Deletes all folders &gt; 4 weeks old\n\n++Setup Steps++\n\n1. Clone workflow\n2. Swap credentials for Airtable, AWS, and Slack\n\t- Ensure AWS credential has appropriate IAM policy to manage bucket & objects\n3. Set workflow to \"Active\" \n\n",
