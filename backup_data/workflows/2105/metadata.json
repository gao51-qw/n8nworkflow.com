Add your Google Sheets and Discord credentials.\n2. Create a Google Sheets document that contains `ID` as a column. We're using this to remember which member we received last.\n3. Edit the fields in the setup node `Setup: Edit this to get started`. *You can read up on how to get the Discord IDs via [this link](https://www.pythondiscord.com/pages/guides/pydis-guides/contributing/obtaining-discord-ids/).*\n4. Link to your Discord server in the Discord nodes\n5. Activate the workflow\n6. Call the production webhook URL in your browser\n# Requirements\n- Admin rights in the Discord server and access to the developer portal of discord\n- Google Sheets\n- Minimum n8n version 1.28.0\n# Potential Use cases\n- Writing a direct message to all members of a certain role\n- Analysing user growth on Discord regularly\n- Analysing role distributions on Discord regularly\n- Saving new members in a Discord \n- ...\n\n# Keywords\n`Discord API`, `Getting all members from Discord via API`, `Google Sheets and Discord automation`, `How to get all Discord members via API`\n",
