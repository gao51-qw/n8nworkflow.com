  "description": "## Why You Need This Right Now 💡\n\n**Stop the panic attacks.** We've all been there - accidentally deleted a workflow that took hours to build, or worse, corrupted your entire automation setup. This workflow is your safety net.\n\n**Save your weekends.** Instead of spending hours recreating lost work, get back to what matters. One setup protects everything, automatically.\n\n**Sleep better at night.** Your workflows are safely stored in two places with full version history.

Here are some ideas:\n\n- **Add encryption** for sensitive workflows\n- **Create restore workflows** for one-click recovery\n- **Set up pull requests** for team review of changes\n- **Customize schedules** based on your workflow update frequency\n\n**Created by:** [khaisa Studio](https://khaisa.studio) - Automation experts who actually use this stuff daily\n\n**Tags:** backup, automation, n8n, google-drive, github, workflow-protection, business-continuity\n\n**Questions?** [Get in touch](https://khaisa.studio/contact) - I'm always happy to help fellow automation enthusiasts!\n\n---\n\n*Remember: The best backup is the one you set up before you need it.
