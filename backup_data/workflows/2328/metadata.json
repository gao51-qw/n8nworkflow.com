  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how you can summarise and automate post-meeting actions from video transcripts fed into an AI Agent.\n\nSave time between meetings by allowing AI handle the chores of organising follow-up meetings and invites.\n\n## How it works\n* This workflow scans for the calendar for client or team meetings which were held online. * Attempts will be made to fetch any recorded transcripts which are then sent to the AI agent.\n* The AI agent summarises and identifies if any follow-on meetings are required.\n* If found, the Agent will use its Calendar Tool to to create the event for the time, date and place for the next meeting as well as add known attendees.\n\n## Requirements\n* Google Calendar and the ability to fetch Meeting Transcripts (There is a special OAuth permission for this action!)\n* OpenAI account for access to the LLM.\n\n## Customising the workflow\n\nThis example only books follow-on meetings but could be extended to generate reports or send emails.",
