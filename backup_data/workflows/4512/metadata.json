  "description": "\nAutomate Microsoft Teams Meeting Analysis with GPT-4.1, Outlook & Mem.ai\n    \n- [Watch the YouTube video to get started](https://youtu.be/DRtloBXG8FU)\n- [Follow along with the blog post](https://blog.nocodecreative.io/automate-teams-transcript-to-summary-n8n)\n\n## Template Overview\n\nThis advanced n8n template automates Microsoft Teams meeting analysis, knowledge base creation, and email drafting directly from meeting recordings and transcripts.\n\nIt provides end-to-end automation for the following use cases:\n\n**Meeting Analysis**\n\n- Connects to Microsoft Graph to retrieve meeting recordings, chat messages, and transcripts.\n- Analyses meeting content using AI models.\n- Extracts key points, action items, questions, and themes from meetings automatically.\n\n**AI-Powered Web App**\n\n- Automatically creates a detailed report from past meetings.\n- Stores meeting summaries, metadata, and insights into an easy-to-browse frontend.\n- New meetings are added dynamically without manual work.\n**\nKnowledge Base Indexing (via Mem.ai)**\n\n- Uploads extracted meeting data into a structured knowledge base.\n- Supports categorisation, search and chat functionality across meetings.\n- \n**Draft Follow-Up Emails**\n\n- Draft personalised follow-up emails for meeting participants.\n- Email drafts include:\n    - Meeting summary\n    - Key decisions\n    - Action items\n- Emails can be sent manually with a human in the loop context via Microsoft Outlook integration.\n\n**Core Components**\n\n- Microsoft Graph API for accessing meetings, chats, files, and user profiles.\n- SharePoint API for file storage and search.\n- n8n Webhooks to trigger processes dynamically.\n- Generic OAuth2 authentication for seamless Microsoft access.\n- JavaScript Code Nodes for flexible, intelligent parsing and structuring of meeting data.\n- AI/LLM nodes for summarisation and content creation.\n\nDesigned to be scalable, modular, and easily customisable for different organisation sizes and industries.\n\n🛡️ Note\n\nFailure to correctly configure Azure permissions will prevent the template from functioning. Ensure admin approval is fully completed during setup.\n\n## **Important Prerequisites**\n\n⚠️ Administrator consent is required\n\nThis template requires a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator or Application Administrator to grant admin consent to a set of Microsoft Graph and SharePoint API scopes.\n\nBasic Azure App Registration knowledge is required:\n\nYou need to set up an Azure App Registration manually, configure OAuth2 authentication, and assign specific API permissions.\n\nA setup guide is included, but familiarity with:\n\n- App registrations\n- API permissions\n- Client secrets\n- OAuth2 flows\n\nis highly recommended.\n\nKnowledge of Postgres is required\nThe template includes a SQL script to create the required Postgres table (see blog post).\n\nYou are responsible for hosting your own database (You can use Supabase with the Postgres connection string).\n",
