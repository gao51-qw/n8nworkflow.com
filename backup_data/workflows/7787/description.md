What this workflow does
-----------------------

Provides the **tools layer** for the Parent agent to manage Google Calendar: **Get** (list events), **Create**, and **Delete**. Accepts `text` + `sessionid` from the Parent and uses an LLM with short-term memory to choose and run the correct tool.

**Pipeline:** Execute Workflow Trigger → Sub-Agent → (Get / Create / Delete) → Google Calendar

**Category:** Productivity / Calendar / Agentic\
**Time to set up:** ~10 minutes\
**Difficulty:** Intermediate\
**Cost:** Mostly free (n8n CE; OpenAI + Google Calendar usage as configured)

Testing (direct call example)
-----------------------------

-   From the Parent, send: "**Schedule 'Team Sync' tomorrow 10:00--11:00**" → Sub-Agent should call **Create**.

-   "**List events next week**" → **Get** with `timeMin`/`timeMax`.

-   "**Delete event 'Team Sync'**" → **Delete** with `eventId` once matched.
