  "description": "# Automated AI Web Scraper\n\nThis workflow uses the [**Zyte API**](https://www.zyte.com/?utm_campaign=Discord_n8n_tpl&utm_activity=Community&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Discord) to automatically detect and extract structured data from E-commerce sites, Articles, Job Boards, and Search Engine Results (SERP) - no custom CSS selectors required.\n\nIt features a robust **\"Two-Phase Architecture\"** (Crawler + Scraper) that handles pagination loops, error retries, and data aggregation automatically, ensuring you get a clean CSV export even for large sites with thousands of pages.\n\nIf you prefer to use your own parsing logic and just need raw data, it provides a \"Manual Mode\" for that capability as well.\n\n## Supported Modes\n* **E-commerce / Product:** Extract prices, images, SKUs, and availability.\n* **Articles / News / Forums:** Extract headlines, body text, authors, and dates.\n* **Job Boards / Postings:** Extract salaries, locations, and descriptions.\n* **SERP (Search Engine Results)**: Extract search rankings, organic results, and snippets.\n* **General Scraping:** Get raw BrowserHtml, HTTP Response codes, Network API traffic, or Screenshots to parse yourself.\n\n## How it works\n* **Input:** You enter a URL and choose a goal (e.g., \"Scrape all pages\") via a user-friendly form.\n* **Smart Routing:** A logic engine automatically configures the correct extraction model for the target website.\n* **Two-Phase Extraction:** (Active only for \"Scrape all pages\") Phase 1 maps out all available URLs (Crawling), and Phase 2 extracts the rich data (Scraping), filtering out errors before saving to CSV.\n\n## Set up steps\n1.  **Get your API Key:** You need a free Zyte API key to run the AI extraction. [**Get it here**](https://www.zyte.com/?utm_campaign=Discord_n8n_tpl&utm_activity=Community&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Discord).\n2.  **Run:** Open the Form view, paste your key, select your target website, and hit Submit.\n3.  **Export:** The workflow will process the data and output a downloadable CSV file.\n\n\n## Resources\n- [**Zyte API Documentation**](https://docs.zyte.com/?utm_campaign=Discord_n8n_docs&utm_activity=Community&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Discord)\n- [**Get Help**](https://discord.com/invite/eN83rMWqAt) (with API errors & extraction logic)\n",
