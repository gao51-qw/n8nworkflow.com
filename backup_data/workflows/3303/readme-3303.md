# AI-powered research assistant for platform questions with GPT-4o and MCP

>  ## Description

This workflow empowers you to effortlessly get answers to your n8n platform questions through an AI-powered assistant. Simply send your query, and the assistant will search documentation, forum posts, and example workflows to provide comprehensive, accurate responses tailored to your specific needs.

&gt; **Note:** This workflow uses community nodes (n8n-nodes-mcp.mcpClientTool) and will only work on self-hosted n8n instances. You'll need to install the required community nodes before importing this workflow.

## n8n Nodes Used

- When chat message received (Chat Trigger)
- OpenAI Chat Model (GPT-4o mini)
- N8N AI Agent
- n8n-assistant tools (MCP Client Tool - Community Node)
- n8n-assistant execute (MCP Client Tool - Community Node)

## Prerequisites

- Self-hosted n8n instance
- OpenAI API credentials
- MCP client community node installed
- MCP server configured to search n8n resources

## Setup

1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance
2. Configure the OpenAI credentials
3. Configure your MCP client API credentials
4. In the n8n-assistant execute node, ensure the parameter is set to "specific" (corrected from "spesific")
5. Test the workflow by sending a message with an n8n-related question

## MCP Server Connection

To connect to the MCP server that powers this assistant's research capabilities, you need to use the following URL:
https://smithery.ai/server/@onurpolat05/n8n-assistant

This MCP server is specifically designed to search across three types of n8n resources:
1. Official documentation for general platform information and workflow creation guidance
2. Community forums for bug-related issues and troubleshooting
3. Example workflow repositories for reference implementations

Configure this URL in your MCP client credentials to enable the assistant to retrieve relevant information based on user queries.

This workflow combines the convenience of chat with the power of AI to provide a seamless n8n platform research experience. Start getting instant answers to your n8n questions today!
