## Who is this for?

This workflow is for **healthcare professionals, consultants, coaches, and service businesses** who want to completely automate their appointment booking system via WhatsApp — without manual intervention for reservations, availability checks, or cancellation management.

## What problem is this workflow solving? / Use case

Managing appointments manually via WhatsApp is extremely time-consuming: checking availability, confirmations, rescheduling, cancellations. This workflow **automates the entire process** — from initial request to final confirmation — allowing your clients to book, modify, or cancel appointments 24/7, in natural language, directly via WhatsApp.

## What this workflow does

* Processes multi-modal messages (text, audio, images) from WhatsApp Business API
* Detects message type and routes to appropriate processing (Whisper for audio, GPT-4 Vision for images)
* Uses AI Agent with 5 Cal.com tools to manage complete appointment lifecycle
* Checks real-time availability in your Cal.com calendar
* Books appointments autonomously without human intervention
* Handles cancellations and rescheduling requests
* Maintains conversation context with Simple Memory for natural exchanges
* Formats responses with Unicode bold for better WhatsApp readability

**The result:** a fully automated 24/7 appointment management system via WhatsApp.
