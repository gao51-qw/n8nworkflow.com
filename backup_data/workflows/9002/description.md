# Send WooCommerce New Category Alert via WhatsApp Using Rapiwa API

This n8n automation listens for the creation of a new WooCommerce product category, fetches all WooCommerce customers, cleans and formats their phone numbers, verifies them using the Rapiwa WhatsApp validation API, sends a WhatsApp message to verified numbers with the new category info, and logs each interaction into a Google Sheet (separately for verified and unverified customers).

## Who this is for

You have a WooCommerce store and want to:

- Send a promotional message when a new product category is added,  
- Verify customer WhatsApp numbers in bulk,  
- Keep a clear log in Google Sheets of which numbers are verified or not.

## What it does (high level)

1. Webhook is triggered when a new WooCommerce category is created.  
2. Fetches all WooCommerce customers via API.  
3. Limits processing to the first 10 customers (for performance/testing).  
4. Cleans phone numbers (removes `+`, spaces, and non-digits).  
5. Verifies each number via Rapiwa WhatsApp Verify API.  
6. If verified: sends WhatsApp message with new category info, logs as `Verification = verified`, `Status = sent`.  
7. If not verified: logs as `Verification = unverified`, `Status = not sent`.  
8. Processes users in batches with delays to avoid rate limiting.

## How it works (step-by-step)

- **Trigger**: Webhook node is triggered by WooCommerce category creation.  
- **Format Data**: Category details (name, slug, description) are parsed.  
- **Get Customers**: Fetch all WooCommerce customers using the WooCommerce API.  
- **Limit**: Only the first 10 are processed.  
- **Loop & Clean**: Loop over each customer, clean phone numbers and extract info.  
- **Verify Number**: Send HTTP POST to `https://app.rapiwa.com/api/verify-whatsapp`.  
- **Decision Node**: Use `If` node to check if `exists == true`.  
- **Send Message**: If verified, send WhatsApp message with category details.  
- **Append to Sheet**: Log verified and unverified customers separately in Google Sheets.  
- **Wait + Batch Control**: Use `Wait` and `SplitInBatches` nodes to control flow and prevent throttling.

### Example verify body (HTTP Request node):

```json
{
  ""number"": ""{{ $json['WhatsApp No'] }}""
}
```

## Customization ideas

- Send images, videos, or template messages if supported by Rapiwa.  
- Personalize messages using name or category data.  
- Increase delay or reduce batch size to minimize risk of rate limits.  
- Add a second sheet to log full API responses for debugging and auditing.

## Best practices

- Test on small batches before scaling.  
- Only send messages to users who opted in.  
- Store API credentials securely using n8n’s credentials manager.  
- Ensure your Google Sheet column headers match exactly with what's expected.

### Key Improvements Made

- Clarified the **trigger source** as a _Webhook from WooCommerce category creation_.  
- Fixed inconsistency in the **""What it does""** section (originally referenced reading from Google Sheets, but your workflow starts from WooCommerce, not Sheets).  
- Standardized terminology to match n8n nodes: Webhook, Loop, HTTP Request, etc.  
- Aligned the flow exactly with your nodes:  
  - Webhook → Format → Get Customers → Limit → Loop → Clean → Verify → If → Send/Log → Wait → Repeat
