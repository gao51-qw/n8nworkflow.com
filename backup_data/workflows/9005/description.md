Automatically scrape X (Twitter) for posts hiring specific roles (e.g., automation engineers, video editors, graphic designers), filter true hiring intent with AI, deduplicate in Google Sheets, and alert via Telegram.

## What it does

- Pulls recent X/Twitter posts for multiple role keywords via Apify.

- Normalizes each post (text, author, links, location).

- Uses an AI Agent to keep only posts where the author is hiring (not self-promo).

- Checks Google Sheets for duplicates by URL before saving.

- Writes qualified posts to a sheet and sends a Telegram notification.

We are using n8n automation roles as the example here


## How it works (Step by Step)

1. **Schedule Trigger** – Runs on an interval (currently every 12 hours).

2. **Scrape X/Twitter** – Apify tweet-scraper fetches up to 50 latest posts for keywords like:
n8n developer, looking for n8n, n8n expert, hire AI automation, looking for AI automation.

3. **Normalize Fields** – Set node maps to: url, text, author.userName, author.url, author.location.

4. **AI Filter & Dedupe Check**

- Accept only clear hiring posts for n8n/AI automation roles (reject self-promotion).
- Queries Google Sheets to see if url already exists; duplicates are dropped.

5. **Gate** – IF node passes only non-empty AI outputs.

6. **Parse JSON Safely** – Code node extracts/validates JSON from the AI output.

7. **Save to Google Sheets** – Appends/updates a row (matching on url).

8. **Telegram Alert** – Sends a message with the tweet URL, author, location, and text.

## Who it’s for

Freelancers, agencies, and job seekers who want a steady radar of real hiring posts for their target roles.

## Customization Ideas

Swap keywords to track other roles (video editors, designers, copywriters, etc.).

Add Slack/Discord notifications.

Extend the AI rules (e.g., different geographies or role scopes).

Treat the sheet as a mini-CRM (status, outreach date, notes).
