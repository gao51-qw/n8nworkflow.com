Automatically generate a meeting summary from your meetings through Fireflies.ai, save it to a Dart document, and create a review task with the meeting link attached.

## What it does

This workflow activates when a Fireflies.ai meeting is processed (via a webhook). It retrieves the meeting transcript via the FirefliesAI transcript node and uses an AI model to generate a structured summary.

## Who’s it for

* Teams or individuals needing automatic meeting notes.
* Project managers tracking reviews and actions from meetings.
* Users of Fireflies.ai and Dart who want to streamline their documentation and follow-up process.

## How to set up

* Import the workflow into n8n.
* Connect your Dart account (it will need workspace and folder access).
* Add your PROD webhook link from the webhook node to your Fireflies.ai API settings.
* Add your Fireflies.ai API key on the Fireflies Transcript node.
* Replace the dummy Folder ID and Dartboard ID with your actual target IDs.
* Choose your preferred AI model for generating the summaries.

## Requirements

* n8n account
* Connected Dart account
* Connected Fireflies.ai account (with access to API key and webhooks)

## How to customize the workflow

* Edit the AI prompt to adjust the tone, style, or format of the meeting summaries.
* Add, remove, or change the summary sections to match your needs (e.g., Key takeaways, Action Items, Summary).
