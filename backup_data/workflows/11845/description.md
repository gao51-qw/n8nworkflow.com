## What this workflow does

This workflow monitors your Gmail inbox for new, unreplied emails and automatically generates a professional reply draft using AI.  
Instead of sending the email automatically, the draft is sent to Slack so a human can review and decide whether to send it.

This makes it ideal for teams that want to save time on email replies while keeping full control over outgoing communication.
