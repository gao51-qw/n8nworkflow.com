  "description": "## 📌Who is this for?\nHR teams, IT Operations, and System Administrators managing employee onboarding at scale.\nIt’s perfect if you use Odoo 18 to trigger account requests and need Redmine + GitLab accounts created instantly and consistently.\n\n## 📌The Problem\nManual account creation creates bottlenecks:\n- IT waits for HR notifications that often get missed or delayed.\n- Duplicate accounts pile up when no one checks existing data first.\n- Account creation timelines are inconsistent (sometimes correct, sometimes wrong).\n- Zero visibility into what succeeded or failed.\n\n## 📌What It Does\n Catches an employee account creation request from Odoo 18 → queries employee data → checks for existing accounts → creates only the accounts that are missing → notifies your team via Slack with the full status.\nHere's the flow in detail:\n1. **Webhook trigger from Odoo 18** - automatically fires when your HR team marks an employee as needing Redmine, GitLab, or both.\n2. **Fetch employee data from Odoo 18** - pulls email and account type requirements.\n3. **Deduplicate requests** - separates \"needs both,\" \"GitLab only,\" and \"Redmine only\" cases.\n4. **Check for existing accounts** - queries Redmine and GitLab to avoid duplicate creation attempts.\n5. **Create accounts** - uses Redmine and GitLab APIs to spin up accounts (only if they don't exist).\n6. **Slack notification** - sends a summary showing what was created, skipped, or failed- including error details if something went wrong.\n\n## 📌Quick Setup\n- Generate a Webhook URL in n8n and configure Odoo 18 to call it during onboarding.\n- Add Redmine admin API key and GitLab admin access token.\n- Enable /users.json (Redmine) and /users (GitLab) endpoints.\n- Configure Slack webhook for notifications.\n- Test with sample data, then activate.\n\n## 📌Results\n- Zero duplicates - the system checks before creating.\n- Full visibility - Slack reports every single attempt.\n- Instant delivery - new hires get accounts on day one.\n- Dramatically reduced IT workload.\n\n## 📌Take It Further\n- Auto-assign projects in Redmine/GitLab post-creation.\n- Generate passwords or TOTP setup and email them to new hires.\n- Log everything to Google Sheets, Notion, or a database.\n- Handle multi-tenant setups if your Odoo manages multiple organizations.\n- Add provisioning for Slack, Google Workspace, VPN, or other systems.\n\n## 📌Need help customizing?\nContact me for consulting and support:\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bac-ha-software/posts/?feedView=all) / [Website](https://bachasoftware.com/bhsoft-contacts)",
