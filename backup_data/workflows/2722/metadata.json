  "description": "## Problem\nTeams often struggle with email overload, leading to missed actions and inefficient meeting preparation.\n\n## Solution\nThis workflow automates email management using n8n and AI. It fetches emails, summarizes key points and actions, and sends two concise updates—one in the morning and one at night.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- Triggers at 7 AM and 9 PM: Automates the process to summarize emails received during specific time blocks.\n\n- Fetches Emails: Retrieves emails from the last 24 hours or after a specific time.\n\n- Summarizes with AI: Uses OpenAI to process the email content into actionable summaries.\nSends Team Updates: Compiles the summaries into a concise, formatted email and sends it to the team.\n\n## Expected Results\nSignificant reduction in missed actions and follow-ups. \n\n## Customizations\nAdjust timings, filters, and recipients to suit your team’s needs.",
