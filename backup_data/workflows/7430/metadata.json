  "description": "# Voice Note Context Extraction Pipeline with AI Agent & Vector Storage\n\n\n### This n8n template demonstrates how to automatically extract and store contextual information from voice notes using AI agents and vector databases for future retrieval.\n\n\n### How it works\n\n- **Webhook trigger** receives voice note data including title, transcript, and timestamp from external services (example here: voicenotes.com)\n- **Field extraction** isolates the key data fields (title, transcript, timestamp) for processing\n- **AI Context Agent** processes the transcript to extract meaningful context while:\n  - Correcting speech-to-text errors\n  - Converting first-person references to third-person facts\n  - Filtering out casual conversation and focusing on significant information\n- **Output formatting** structures the extracted context with timestamps for embedding\n- **File conversion** prepares the context data for vector storage\n- **Vector embedding** uses OpenAI embeddings to create searchable representations\n- **Milvus storage** stores the embedded context for future retrieval in RAG applications\n\n### How to use\n\n- Configure the webhook endpoint to receive data from your voice note service\n- Set up credentials for OpenRouter (LLM), OpenAI (embeddings), and Milvus (vector storage)\n- Customize the AI agent's system prompt to match your context extraction needs\n- The workflow automatically processes incoming voice notes and stores extracted context\n\n### Requirements\n\n- OpenRouter account for LLM access\n- OpenAI API key for embeddings\n- Milvus vector database (cloud or self-hosted)\n- Voice note service with webhook capabilities (e.g., Voicenotes.com)\n\n### Customizing this workflow\n\n- **Modify the context extraction prompt** to focus on specific types of information (preferences, facts, relationships)\n- **Add filtering logic** to process only voice notes with specific tags or keywords\n- **Integrate with other storage** systems like Pinecone, Weaviate, or local vector databases\n- **Connect to RAG systems** to use the stored context for enhanced AI conversations\n- **Add notification nodes** to confirm successful context extraction and storage\n\n### Use cases\n\n- **Personal AI assistant** that remembers your preferences and context from voice notes\n- **Knowledge management** system for capturing insights from recorded thoughts\n- **Content creation** pipeline that extracts key themes from voice recordings\n- **Research assistant** that builds context from interview transcripts or meeting notes",
