## How it works

This n8n template automates lead processing from your website. It receives customer data via a Webhook, stores the customer's contact (email or phone number) in the respective [**SendPulse**](https://sendpulse.com) address books, and uses the [**SendPulse MCP Server**](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/account-settings/mcp-server)  to send personalized welcome messages (email or SMS) generated using AI.

The template also includes built-in SendPulse token management logic with caching in the Data Table, which reduces the number of unnecessary API requests.

[**SendPulse’s MCP server**](https://sendpulse.com/knowledge-base/account-settings/mcp-server) is a tool that helps you manage your account through a chat with an AI assistant. It uses SendPulse API methods to get information and perform actions, such as request statistics, run message campaigns, or update user data.

MCP server acts as middleware between your AI assistant and your [**SendPulse account**](https://sendpulse.com). It processes requests through the SendPulse API and sends results back to chat, so you can manage everything without leaving the conversation.

Once connected, the MCP server operates as follows:

1. You ask your AI assistant something in chat.
2. It forwards your request to the MCP server.
3. The MCP server calls the API to get data or perform an action.
4. The AI assistant sends the result back to your chat.
