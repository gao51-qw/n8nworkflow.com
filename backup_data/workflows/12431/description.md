## Who’s it for
Property management companies, building managers, and inspection teams who want to automate recurring property inspections, improve issue tracking, and streamline reporting.

## How it works / What it does
This n8n workflow schedules periodic property inspections using a Cron trigger. AI generates customized inspection checklists for each property, which are sent to assigned inspectors. Inspectors submit photos and notes via a connected form or mobile app. AI analyzes these submissions to flag issues based on priority (high, medium, low). High-priority issues are routed to managers via Slack/email, while routine notes are logged for reporting. The workflow also generates weekly or monthly summary reports and can optionally notify tenants of resolved issues.

## How to set up
- Configure the Cron trigger with your desired inspection frequency.
- Connect Google Sheets or your CRM to fetch property and tenant data.
- Set up OpenAI node with your API key and checklist generation prompts.
- Configure email/SMS notifications for inspectors.
- Connect a form or mobile app via Webhook to collect inspection data.
- Set up Slack/email notifications for managers.
- Log all inspection results, photos, and flagged issues into Google Sheets.
- Configure summary report email recipients.

## Requirements
- n8n account with Google Sheets, Email, Slack, Webhook, and OpenAI nodes.
- Property and tenant data stored in Google Sheets or CRM.
- OpenAI API credentials for AI checklist generation and note analysis.

## How to customize the workflow
- Adjust Cron frequency to match inspection schedule.
- Customize AI prompts for property-specific checklist items.
- Add or remove branches for issue severity (high/medium/low).
- Include additional notification channels if needed (Teams, SMS, etc.).

## Workflow Use Case
Automates property inspections for property management teams, ensuring no inspections are missed, AI-generated checklists standardize the process, and potential issues are flagged and routed efficiently. Saves time, improves compliance, and increases tenant satisfaction.
